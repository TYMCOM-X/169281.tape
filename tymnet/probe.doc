PROBE DOCUMENT
LAST UPDATE: 8 MAY 1979 (VERSION 18)

		PROBE IS THE ACCESS AND CONTROL PROGRAM
		FOR THE ENGINE SUPERVISOR

   TOPIC HEADINGS START WITH ** LEFT ADJUSTED. IN EDITOR THE
COMMAND SEQUENCE
*FIND !**!
PRINT? Y
	  WILL TYPE OUT A TABLE OF CONTENTS

** STARTUP
   IF THE TIME IS UNDEFINED THE NEXT PERSON TO LOGIN TO PROBE
WILL BE ASKED TO SUPPLY GREENWICH MEAN TIME IN THE FORMAT
DD:HH:MM WHERE DD IS THE NUMBER OF DAYS SINCE THE BEGINING OF THE
YEAR. WHEN THE TYMNET CLOCK IS INSTALLED, THIS FUNCTION WILL NORMALLY
BE HANDLED BY THE TYMNET CLOCK. CONTROL Q WILL SKIP TO LOGIN.

** LOGIN
   ALL ENGINE SUPERVISORS WILL RUN ON "HOST" SYSTEMS 120 THROUGH
127. THE FOLLOWING ARE VALID WAYS OF GETTING INTO PROBE:
PROBE:127;(PASSWORD);
PROBE:*;(PASSWORD)CR
   THE ASTERISK REFERS TO THE CURRENTLY ACTIVE SUPERVISOR. NOTE THAT
ONE MAY END THE PROBE PASSWORD WITH A SEMICOLON OR CARRIAGE RETURN, BUT
NOT BOTH.
AFTER THE CIRCUIT HAS BEEN BUILT TO THE ENGINE, PROBE WILL ASK FOR
THE USER NAME. AFTER THE NAME HAS BEEN ENTERED, IT WILL ASK FOR
THE PASSWORD.
   NOTE: USER NAME STANDBY MAY ONLY BE LOGGED IN FROM ONE TERMINAL
AT A TIME. AN ATTEMPT TO LOG IN FROM A SECOND TERMINAL WILL
BE REJECTED.

** COMMAND MODE
   WHENEVER A COLON APPEARS ON THE LEFT HAND MARGIN, PROBE IS
READY TO ACCEPT ANOTHER COMMAND. ALL COMMANDS ARE TYPED ON ONE LINE
AND ENDED WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN. TO GET BACK TO COMMAND MODE (AFTER
LOGIN HAS BEEN COMPLETED) TYPE A CONTROL Q OR ESCAPE.  THIS WILL
ABORT THE CURRENT ACTIVITY AND RETURN TO COMMAND MODE.
IF THE SUPERVISOR IS FROZEN (SEE BELOW) THE WORDS 'SUP FROZEN' WILL
APPEAR AFTER EACH COMMAND HAS BEEN EXECUTED.
   A CONTROL A WILL BACK UP THE INPUT LINE POINTER ONE POSITION.
USED FOR FIXING TYPING ERRORS.

** SYS			NO STATUS
   TYPE OUT HOST, OR SYSTEM NUMBER.

** TIME 		NO STATUS
   TYPE OUT TIME IF DEFINED, ELSE "UNDEFINED TIME".

** ETIME		RESTRICTED STATUS
   ALLOWS ONE TO REENTER TIME.

** WHO			NO STATUS
   THE WHO COMMAND LISTS THE CURRENT PROBE USERS AND THEIR JOB LABLES.
THE LABLES ARE NEEDED FOR THE SEND AND HANG COMMANDS.

** VERSION		NO STATUS
   PRINTS OUT THE VERSION NUMBERS OF PROBE, THE KERNEL,
AND THE SUPERVISOR.

** STAT 		NO STATUS
   THIS PRINTS OUT THE NUMBERS
OF NODES IN EACH OF THE 5 TYMNET I TAKEOVER STATES, AND THE
2 TYMNET II TAKEOVER STATES.  DURING SUPERVISOR INITIALIZATION
THE SUPERVISOR WILL APPEAR TO BE RUNNING WITH ZERO NODES IN ALL
STATES.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE WORDS 'SUP INITIALIZATION' WILL
APPEAR.  THE SECOND LINE WILL LIST THE DF (DROWSINESS FACTOR),
AND THE REJECT COUNT. THE REJECT COUNT IS THE COUNT OF THE NUMBER
OF TIMES THE SUPERVISOR COULD NOT BUILD A CIRCUIT BECAUSE OF SHUT
LINES, LINES OUT OF CHANNELS, OR NODES OUT OF PASSTHROUGHS.
THE SOURCE AND DESTINATION NODES OF THE LAST REJECTED
LOGIN ATTEMPT ARE PRINTED AFTER THE REJECT COUNT.
IF SUP IS NOT RUNNING (NEITHER AWAKE NOR ASLEEP) THE KERNEL STATUS
WILL APPEAR AT THE END OF THE FIRST LINE.  THE KERNEL STATUS MAY BE
INTERPRETED AS FOLLOWS:
	1000	FROZEN BY OPERATOR
	 800	PARITY ERROR IN THE SUPERVISOR - OR JOE RINDE HAS
		STOPPED THE SUPERVISOR FOR EXAMINATION
	 100 OR
	 500	SUPERVISOR HAS FAILED TO RECOVER FROM A CRASH - THE
		SUPERVISOR CODE AREA HAS PROBABLY BEEN CLOBBERED.
THE KERNEL STATUS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE WORD 'FROZEN'

** TSTAT		NO STATUS
   PRINTS TIME, THEN SAME AS STAT COMMAND

** ASTAT		NO STATUS
   PRINTS THE NUMBER OF LOGIN TIMEOUTS OF TERMINAL AND AUXCILLIARY
CIRCUITS.  IN ADDITION IT PRINTS THE NUMBER OF THESE TIMEOUTS THAT
OCCURED DURING CIRCUIT BUILDING.


** COUNT		NO STATUS
   THIS COUNTS THE NUMBER OF NODES, TERMINATIONS, AND PASSTHROUGHS
DOES NOT COUNT INTERNAL CIRCUITS AS TERMINATIONS.

** CT NODE		NO STATUS
   THIS TRACES ALL CIRCUITS TERMINATING AT THIS NODE.
PORT NUMBERS ARE IN DECIMAL.

** CP NODE		NO STATUS
   THIS TRACES ALL CIRCUITS PASSING THROUGH THIS NODE.

** CL NODE LINE 	NO STATUS
   TRACES CIRCUITS ON THIS LINE.

** HOST 		NO STATUS
   TYPES INFORMATION ABOUT A HOST OR HOSTS. EXAMPLES:
HOST 19 	TYPES INFO ABOUT HOST 19
HOST		TYPES INFO ABOUT ALL HOSTS
   THE INFO TYPED IS HOST NUMBER, DOWN, SHUT, NO PORTS OR ANSWERED,
POSITION NUMBER ON ITS BASE, BASE NUMBER, AND HOST COST

** AN			NO STATUS
   ALL NODES. FOR ALL NODES IN NET TYPE OUT NODE NUMBER, VERSION NUMBER,
NODE TYPE, HOST NUMBERS (IF ANY), TERMINATIONS (NOT COUNTING INTERNAL
CIRCUITS), PASSTHROUGHS, CRASH COUNT, UPSTREAM NODE NUMBER, AND
DOWNSTREAM NODE NUMBER.

**  AD			NO STATUS
   LIST ALL DOWN NODES.  WILL LIST NODES WHICH ARE NOT IN NET, BUT
KNOWN BY NODES WHICH ARE.

**  EXC 		NO STATUS
   LIST LINES WHICH ARE OUT OR IN SOME OTHER EXCEPTIONAL STATE.

** N
   SHORT FOR NODE, SEE BELOW.

** NODE NODE		NO STATUS
   EXAMPLE:
NODE 5
WILL GIVE VERSION NUMBER, CRASH COUNT, UPSTREAM DIRECTION, DOWNSTREAM
DIRECTION, AND EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS FOR THIS NODE. WILL ALSO GIVE
NUMBER OF PASSTHROUGHS AND TERMINATIONS. IF NODE IS A BASE,
WILL GIVE HOST NUMBERS AND STATUS OF EACH HOST. HOSTS WILL APPEAR
IN ORDER OF POSITION ON BASE. WILL ALSO GIVE
NEIGHBOR NUMBER, NUMBER OF GROUPS, COST OF USING LINE, AND EXCEPTIONAL
CONDITIONS FOR EACH LINE. DOES NOT COUNT INTERNAL CIRCUITS
AS TERMINATIONS.

** NIEGHBOR NODE	NO STATUS
   EXAMPLE:
NIEGHBOR 77
WILL SCAN NODE DESCRIPTORS OF ALL NODES TO FIND REFERENCES TO THE
SPECIFIED NODE. WILL PRINT OUT THE NODE NUMBER, LINE NUMBER, AND
NUMBER OF GROUPS FOR THE NIEGHBOR OF THE SPECIFIED NODE.
THIS COMMAND WORKS ON PHANTOM NODES THE SAME WAY AS REAL ONES.

** DF (NUMBER)		STATUS 01
   DROWSYNESS FACTOR. WHEN THE SUPERVISOR GOES TO SLEEP, IT COMPUTES THE
NUMBER OF SECONDS IT IS TO REMAIN ASLEEP BASED ON ITS NUMBER, ECT. THE
DROWSYNESS FACTOR IS A NUMBER THAT GETS ADDED IN. 1000 DECIMAL IS THE
LARGEST NUMBER THAT ONE MAY ENTER. THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF
SUPPRESSING THE SUPERVISOR.

** AWAKE		STATUS 01
   AWAKEN SUPERVISOR RIGHT AWAY. OVERRIDES ALL PREVIOUS REASONS FOR
SLEEPING, INCLUDING A LARGE DF.  THE TIME IS PRINTED.

CIRCULAR BUFFER. RETAKE USES A K INSTEAD OF AN R. THIS COMMAND
PRINTS THE BUFFER, BEGINING WITH THE MOST RECENT ENTRY.

** TREE N		RESTRICTED STATUS
   PRINTS OUT THE TREE STRUCTURE OF SUPERVISORY CONTROL. N IS
THE STARTING, OR ROOT NODE. IF NOT SPECIFIED, THE BASE OF THE SUPERVISOR

STATUS TO EXECUTE ALL COMMANDS. THERE ARE 128 SLOTS ON THE DISK FOR OTHER
USER NAMES. THE LIST COMMAND WILL DISPLAY THEM. THE ENTER COMMAND WILL
MAKE CHANGES TO THE LIST. EXAMPLES:
ENTER 49		REMOVE ENTRY 49
ENTER 0 SAM 77		ENTER SAM INTO SLOT 0. TURN ON ALL STATUS BITS
	SO HE CAN EXECUTE ALL COMMANDS EXCEPT LIST, ENTER, AND INITL.
ENTER 63 JANJANJI 00	PUT JANJANJI INTO SLOT 63 WITH NO STATUS. HE CAN
	STILL EXECUTE COMMANDS WHICH REQUIRE NO STATUS.
ENTER 5 MACK 20 	PUT MACK INTO SLOT 5 WITH STATUS 20. HE CAN
	EXECUTE RETAKE, WHICH REQUIRES STATUS 20, BUT NOT ESHUT, WHICH
	REQUIRES STATUS 10. TO EXECUTE BOTH, HE WOULD REQUIRE

	COMMANDS.

   SLOT NUMBERS ARE DECIMAL FROM 0 TO 63. STATUS NUMBERS ARE OCTAL,
6 BITS LONG, ONE BIT FOR EACH STATUS CLASS. A NAME CAN BE FROM 1 TO 8
CHARACTERS LONG AND CAN INCLUDE LETTERS, NUMBERS, AND A FEW OTHER
CHARACTERS.

** INITL		RESTRICTED STATUS  CAN ONLY BE EXECUTED
				FROM RPROBE
   INITIALIZES THE ERROR LOG TO ALL ZEROES. SHOULD ONLY BE DONE AFTER
DISK MAINTAINENCE, AS DOING IT ANY OTHER TIME WOULD DESTROY THE ERROR
LOG.
** INITA		RESTRICTED STATUS  CAN ONLY BE EXECUTED
			FROM RPROBE
   LIKE INITL, BUT FOR ACCOUNTING FILE

** LRATE		NO STATUS
   PRINTS THE SUPERVISOR LOGIN RATE IN LOGINS PER MINUTE
