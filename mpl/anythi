     INSIDE LEFT, SUBHEAD:             A Brief Background on AHR

     COPY:                                In 1974, the U.S. Congress passed

                                       Public Law 93-641 which established

                                       uniform cost accounting as one of

                                       ten national health priorities.

                                       Three years later, Congress passed

                                       Public Law 95-142 which amended the

                                       Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and

                                       Abuse Act to mandate uniform

                                       financial reporting by health care

                                       facilities within approximatly two

                                       years.  Then in October 1978, HEW's

                                       Health Care Financing Administration

                                       published a notice of proposed

                                       rulemaking for a System for Hospital

                                       Uniform Reporting (SHUR).

                                          "Uniform reporting systems for

                                       health services facilities and

                                       organizations" were officially

                                       proposed in the Federal Register by

                                       HEW in January 1979.  These proposed

                                       rules were sent out to a multitude

                                       of professionals in the medical

                                       field for comment.  The large number

                                       of comments received in response to

                                       the proposed SHUR regulations

                                       resulted in a revised version in

                                       March 1980.  This version proposes

                                       to establish an Annual Hospital

                                       Report (AHR) to document financial

                                       data, substantially reducing the

                                       cost and reporting burdens of SHUR.

                                          Although the final form that AHR

                                       will take is unknown, some form of

                                       uniform financial reporting for

                                       hospitals is probable in the not too

                                       distant future.

     COPY:                                The reporting requirements that

                                       AHR would impose are meant to obtain

                                       comparable information on the costs

                                       and volume of services administered

                                       by all hospitals participating in

                                       Medicare and Medicaid programs.

                                       These requirements would mandate

                                       comprehensive statistical reports on

                                       revenue sources and costs of medical

                                       treatment by virtually all of the

                                       nation's hospitals.  The level of

                                       detail and sophistication needed to

                                       fulfill AHR's reporting requirements

                                       may well lead to the extensive

                                       revision of most hospitals'

                                       accounting systems - a chore that,

                                       if handled inhouse, would mean

                                       greatly expanded clerical staffs,

                                       equipment requirements, and

                                       professional consultant costs.

                                          Pilot versions of AHR have

                                       already been authorized and

                                       implemented by legislative and

                                          Health care administrators must

                                       guidelines.  The problem is to find

                                       an effective way to comply with AHR

                                       without exceeding operating budgets

                                          AHR is certain to require the

                                       reporting of revenue and related

                                       standard units of measure by program

                                       service.  In this example,

                                       laboratory revenue and workload

                                       measurement units are accumulated

                                       and reported by the outpatient

                                       clinic program service.

                                       Additionally, data for ten methods

                                       of payment is reported.  Comparable

                                       reports are developed for each

                                       is a pioneer in the remote computer

                                       services field.  The company was

                                       among the first to implement the

                                       novel concept of "timesharing", the

                                       use of a central computer by a

                                       number of geographically distant

                                       users.  The economies of this
