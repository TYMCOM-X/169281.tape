I know that this sounds like "begging", but did Tim leave any info about
the whereabouts of various things for F40, LIB40, etc... with anyone?
I nee to find some sources, and I'm hard pressed to admit that we can't
get the sources, even if we have to DISREL them from the .REL files!!!

Hi,
  do you happen to know **ANYTHING** about CARMEL, the FUDGE2 replacement
that F40 is setup with?  I can't find **ANY** transmittals or documentation

Sorry I don't know anything about it.  I take it that it's not embedded
in F40's transmittal package? How about some other possible embedding?

Thanks... I just stopped by the office, & at least there's something in
Lois' office on CARMEL, albeit not much!

As for other embedding, it might not be a bad idea, except there seem to
be a couple of "weird" link block-types in some of the .REL files, unless
that's only the CARMEL stuff... sigh....

Oh!  (the reason for the subject: Faith!)  I don't have any for the actual
workings of LIB40, F40, et al as far as the people at tymshare who have
worked (repeat "worked") on it since 1977.  I had Bob Jacobs who works for
Dave miller show me how to use the ARCHIVE data base, and found old-old-old
transmittals (and archived FDM files) for soures that have been "presumed"
LOST for the past 8-10 years.  All I had to do was LOOK, and then restore
the files to see what they contained!!!!!!!!!!  So, I now have sources to
many of the so-called LOST LIB40 routines!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have no faith in the work done by certain individuals!!!!!!!!

Skywalker is what many people tried to tell management they should have
been doing in place of super-engine 3 years ago.  Its basically a bus
oriented engine that'll allow multiple engine CPU's to be plugged in to
the same bus with (possibly) other CPU's (like 68K's).  We've decided
to use VME bus so we'll be able to buy stuff off the shelf if we don't
feel like making it in-house.  REAL distributed processing!  CHEAP!

Subject: FDM v0.7 (???) 

    What is the intent of FDM's design with regard to multiple instances of
    the same file, as regards the WRITE command?  Version 0.7 seems to romp
    sequentially through the FDM file and write all of them, making all but
    the last write useless.

    Fortunately, this is in some sense what I needed, but it also seems to
    make the n-1 preceding instances invisible.  Maybe there is something I
    can say, some primitive dance I can perform, etc.

Subject: MFDSCN 

I won't go into much detail... but (SAILIB)MFDSCN is the stuff that
I told you about.  There are a bunch of programs that I've put together
that use it.  It's much cleaner than the hack in EXTEND which is shown
in INFO on system 33 (I think!).

FINDIT in (CB-SAIL) is probably the best example using just the data
       returned from the .CHUFD CHANIO call.
UNIQUE in (CARL) also uses the .CHUFD data in a slightly different
       way.  First making a list, then printing out the results.

there are lots more... however, I will go and make a copy with the
procedures turned into SIMPLE and see if it (a) works and (b) is any
faster.  /Carl

Subject: More MFDSCN 

Look at (CB-SAIL)COUNT.SAI
it is a very "boring" program which uses MFDSCN.
It merely counts all UFD's and all files.

I tried it with "SIMPLE" vs non-"SIM<PLE" and it seems to be
a tiny bit faster on 930.  Two times each, SCOUNT.SAV (slow) was 118
seconds for 45K files, and COUNT (simple) was 117 seconds.

I ran them on 39, and the results across 65.5K files was inconclusive
while I was NOT the only user.  Setting SCHPRV didn't make much of a
difference, although SCOUNT took 3:51.6 and COUNT took 3:38.8 that
time.  I'm having problems with my MODEM dropping chars, so.. till
later...

Subject: dragon book 

    Carl,

    I have my copy here at work.  I looked, and it seems that the length of
    the stuff being reduced on the stack is known because the production's
    identity is somehow encoded in the state identity.  I think that in the
    case of states with more than one reduction (involving different
    productions), some arbitrary rule is used to determine which gets
    selected.

    What I can't seem to determine without gobs of reading is what the GOTO
    of a reduce state is.  It needs further study, but if you're in the
    neighborhood, you can take a look.

Subject: Parser for filespec 

Well,
  I got frustrated and decided to finally bite the bullet!  Take a
look at (CB-PARSER)STATE.TBL for the current algorithm that I'm
planning on trying to implement for a file-spec parser/scanner.

  The *** TOPS-10 *** states are defined for completeness and may
or may not be available in the final description.  I will probably
pass a data address to the routine which then fills in the following
data fields:
  DEVICE, FILE, EXT, PPN/USERNAME/PATH, PROTECTION,
      FILE-MASK, EXT-MASK, PPN/PATH-MASK.

  Maybe, a count can be passed so you can get only those fields that
you want... sigh...  When I get the SAIL code written, I'll send you a
pointer to the sources.

    Carl,

    I looked a bit at the satate state table you produced, and found that
    it would be a wonderful visual aid if the description at the top of the
    language being parsed were precise.  When I did F!Decompose for Peak, I
    opted to describe things using a BNF-deriviative notation, which you
    might like to look at.  (PEAK)XFILE.SAI, page 4, is the F!Decompose
    routine.

    I think it was a wise decision to do the table by hand, and the
    description you prepared seems quite clear.  Let me know when you break
    into code.

    Carl,

    Consider the following:

        !do fdm

        [FDM File Utility %0.7]

        FDM> o stat
        [Old file: STAT]

        Called from 35612  Last SAIL call at 16655
        ?^C
        !

    STAT, it turns out, is a real file having nothing to do with FDM.  The
    probem appears to be that it found the wrong file and then didn't like
    the fact that it was the wrong file - in a major way.  PCOM does this
    too, finding the wrong file, favoring no extension to the logical
    default extension.  It seems like an easy fix. If you want to specify
    no extension, you say "STAT.".

Subject: Re: Your comment about FILE vs FILE. 

I'd agree that defaults should be defaulted when not specified... but
there is some doubt about when it's specified and when it isn't.  There
is no clear-cut definition about that... i.e.  DIR X  vs  DIR X.*  for
example.  Should both be equivalent?  Sometimes I wish they were and
sometimes I'm glad they're not.  I opt for DIR X  and DIR X.* to mean the
same and if the person says DIR X. then s/he means "X" without a .EXT

When defaulting  to .CTL  or .FDM   what I do, just so people who don't
know any better feel that it's right... I look for X without an extension
and if found, that is used.  Otherwise, I look for X.CTL or X.FDM and if
that's found, I use that.  If it isn't found, I use that anyway... sigh!

If you say OPEN X.  then it should override the ".FDM", although at the
moment I don't know what it does.
