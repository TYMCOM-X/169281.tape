Subject: editors get a fair slice of the machine

I thought you might be interested in these statistics.  Notice the
standing of PEAK, VUE and EDITOR.  My experience seems to indicate
that these pretty well represent the amount of use they get as
opposed to their relative efficiency.  And by the way, if anyone
knows how to make the concurrent pascal compiler (39.42%) run any
faster you could save NTD a great deal of money.  -Bill

PS - this program (WRS:39)TRSTAT won't run on F3's due to its use
of double precision floating point, it might be fun to run on some
of the other systems though.

This chart lists the top users of system 39 by program name for the first
week of May 1984.  I hope that you will find this as intersting as I have.
I will run the program again later in the month when more data is available.

I mean that I believe that its high rank indicates it is prefered.  Most
of the people I know use it, and the ones that use VUE are planning on
switching.  Considering that more programmer time is spent editing than
anything else, using only 5% of the system is great for a full screen
editor.  -Bill

   You will note that if the paragraph in question is only one line

   location by the size of the Left Margin.  Successive applications
   worsen the situation.

Subject: PEAK under SENDMAIL

Sendmail uses Carl's FRMRUN.  I thus refer the problem to him.
Actually, I suppose PEAK ought to enable for NTQ and ZAP and force
a checkpoint.  Note that in order to get ZAP on the command port,
you must set your mode to CONTINUE RUNNING ON DISCONNECT with SETPRV.
It would be polite to remember the previous setting and it restore it
on exit from the program.  -Bill

Subject: WARP (for PEAK) is here

The file (SAILIB)WARP.DOC is on 39 and 930.  It describes the routine
WARP, and the program WARPLD.  This is the code I spoke of for PEAK to
cut down on the initialization delay and increase sharability.  The file
is included below for reference.

	WARP( filename );

    Description:
	Call WARP to create a file that may be loaded and executed by WARPLD.
	Should be called immediately following initialization.  Restrictions:
	no files or interrupts may be open, no instantiation dependent code
	should precede the call to WARP.  Also, no shared or non-private pages

Subject: PEAK Tutorial

Ken:
The present PEAK tutorial says to send mail to LOIS on 33 with comments.
Under the circumstances that seems unwise.  I want to transmit a new tutorial
with either a new username to send mail to or without that section entirely,
ending with logging out. 

Suggestions?  Comments?

    It seems to me that once TUMS/InterOntyme, and other pies in the
    collective sky are in place, we should establish a canonical help
    mail drop (perhaps on Ontyme?).  It seems that once, in Camelot,
    we had one, and we even occasionally looked at it.  I hesitate to
    say that Peak problems constitute the National Emergency that -
    say - DSKCLN getting hungry one rainy night and going on a rampage
    might pose, but at the same time, asking the Folks At Home to send
    their cards and letters to the Dead Letter Office is also a bit
    rude.

Subject: department of interesting statistics

I thought of an interesting statistic that you're in a position
to gather (if you still have access to Peak now that you're at
NTD (congrats)).  The average number of characters (from the
buffer) that are involved in a redisplay.  I.e.  how dense is
the information on the display?  I'm guessing about 80% for text,
and maybe 30-40% for programs.

If you're curious ...

    Peak V2.0(303) on systems :930 and :39 now leads a warped existence.

Bill has told me that space can be compacted by reducing the
actual number of directories on ONTYME by using an alias.  I
would like to know if you would like me to cancel either of
TXS.PEAK or TXS.K/DAWSON, and/or make PEAK an alias of K/DAWSON?
(I ask, since you're not really expecting much to be sent to
 K/DAWSON under TXS, since you have NTD.K/Dawson, right?)

I added the question to omit numbers in the titles at the top of the

If you have another test, (NOT another PEAK) we can run it through as
a final test, which may turn out as a production run if all goes well.

Subject: Timer-Checkpointing Peak V2.0(311)

    Bill,

    It works!  Let's hope that response improves at least noticably,
    if not incredibly.

    It seems that there were a few minor type-o's involved in my
    transcription of the immediate interrupt routine.  This of course
    paralysed the whole mechanism.  Once those were cleaned up, the
    rest was history.

    Although I'm not sure, it appears that the routine actually doing
    the checkpoint - invoked either by the hand-made polling point at
    the character input UUO or at the top of the command loop - MUST
    be a nonsimple procedure.  Otherwise, it seems, the string stack
    gets a bit lost and our [Checkpoint] message never appears.

    A point of disk usage and aesthetics:  The current version will
    cause a Checkpoint to occur every CheckpointInterval seconds as
    long as the buffer continues to be modified.  The earlier version
    of course would Checkpoint only after the keyboard had been idle
    for that period of time.  Despite its generating higher disk
    traffic, the former would seem the more reasonable interpretation.
    I wonder if you can find a basis to disagree.

    Anyway, what fun!  See you later.

    Yes, it's true!  The latest version of Peak, though lacking the
    incredible WARPLD fast-start feature, does have timer-generated
    checkpointing, and therefore spends the bulk of its time in TI
    (rather than SL) state.  This should result in a greater rapport
    with the Tymcom-X scheduler, making the Peak experience a bit
    friskier in loaded situations.

    Let me know if you notice any problems arising from this giant
    leap in Technology.  Use SENDMA.

Subject: Redisp & V2.0(313)

    Carl,

    Regretably, in accomplishing the last magic improvment to Peak
    (Checkpointing by timer), I had to make the redisplay know things
    about the command module that in other applications it has no
    business knowing.  To wit:

        o   external procedure C!DoChkPnt
   o   external boolean   C!TimIntFlg

    The unclean intelligence, fortunately, is confined to the routine
    T!GetC, which gets the next character(s) from the terminal.  The
    reason for its existence is that we must simulate a SAIL polling
    point in order to perform a checkpoint while we are in terminal
    input wait.  If you are curious about the mechanism, take a look
    at T!GetC.

    Sorry about the mess.

Subject: Setting Terminal Type & Peak

    Bill,

    Besides setting the TTY CLASS via the monitor command, as I
    described to you yesterday, there is a way to set the terminal
    type while still in Peak.

        $xset terminal type$vt102$

    This will reset the terminal type for the duration of the current
    edit session, and will not affect the setting of the TTY CLASS
    "variable" for the current job.

Subject: Users using Peak?

    Jon,

    I got a call from a Ron Vivier about his travels in Europe, and
    the demand he ran into from the European affiliates for User
    availibility of Peak on Tymcom-X.  As you know, to date we've had
    an explicit test for the Tymshare Internal Bit in Peak as a means
    of preventing real users from using it.  I told Ron that there is
    no documentation worthy of a general user's consideration, and he
    said that they (the European Operations types making the request)
    were aware of that, but these were no normal users.  In fact, they
    (either the Operations people or the users in question) might very
    well write their own manual for Peak!

    Our options at present are to either continue our past practice of
    adding these users to the execption list, or removing the filter
    altogether, and making it publicly usable.  (In the case of the
    latter, finding out what the "writing their own manual" really
    means would be a good idea.)

    I was wondering about your thoughts on the matter.

    /ken

    PS:  Each path is equally easy to implement.

I have had a request from Peter Stratman, CEGI-Tymshare, for PEAK to be
made available for customer use.  I have checked with Jon, who tells me
to do it, with the explicit provision that we will provide no support.

The only work I see necessary to carry this out is:  1.)  remove the
test for the Tymshare bit in the program, 2.)  the creation of a pricing
schedule, and 3.)  transmittal of the files to the CEGI hosts.  the only
files that I know to be needed by the program and users are:
(SYSNEWS) PEAK.CHT, PEAK.KEY, PEAK.NEW, PEAK.SUM, PEAK.TXT, PEAK.TUT and
(SYS) PEAK.SAV, PEAK.HLP

Please let me know of anything I've missed or any problems we might
encounter.  Please copy Jon on your answer.

Thanks!
/D.

The provision of "no support" sounds nice on paper, but it doesn't hold
water for a product like PEAK.

I'd like to know the following:
   1)  Does CEGI use the Tymshare bit for anything?
       i.e. do any of their programs check for it?
   2)  Do they restrict their customers in any way?
   3)  Do their customers have regular TYMNET access, i.e. TYMNET usernames
       or are they all "only" on the 2020's ((and their 1 KL)).

Depending upon the answers to these questions, HOW to release PEAK to their
users will change.

An aside:  Since Ken Dawson is working for TYMNET again, (as of last wednesday)
           there may be some development work on PEAK in the forseeable future
           and quite possibly, he could make the necessary changes for CEGI for
           us.

One more question for CEGI: How many customer groups do they have?  GAN's...
   PEAK has an internal list of customers who may use it, and depending upon
   their needs, that list could be augmented, or made external, so that CEGI
   could restrict or allow usage of PEAK on a customer by customer basis.

Let me know what you find out.
/Carl

PS:  Until it is decided that PEAK is error-free enough for general customer
     use, I'm against removing the TYMSHARE-BIT restriction.  Especially if
     we're not supporting it!!!!!

These are Tymcom-X systems that we're talking about, aren't they?  When you
get the info you need, I'll be glad to make the modifications necessary.

Like you, I hesitate to shut off Tymshare-bit testing unless we do
something radical like releasing it to the world, with all the hoopla that
that implies.

Thanks for remembering me.

Re:    An idea for an enhancement to PEAK.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a former VUE user, I was trying to do the "Invert Case in Region" function
in PEAK and discovered that it did not exist.  "No problem," I thought.  "I'll
just create my own macro and bind it to some key sequence."  Then I discovered
that it was impossible to even do this (unless I have overlooked something or
you have an unpublished PEAK function).

In my labors to create such a macro, what I needed was a new function similar
to this:  "Repeat the next function until mark (or end-of-line, paragraph,
window, page, etc.)"  Then, I could have defined a region in a macro and
repeated the "Toggle Case of Character" to the end of the region.  I'm sure
that this "Repeat" function would be very useful to create other nice macros.

I don't know if anyone is chartered to add enhancements to PEAK, but I would
vote to add this sort of "Repeat" function.

Thanks for listening.

Subject: PEAK - Toggle case in region, etc

    Craig,

    It seems clear that the easiest solution to the problem at hand, the
    inability to modify case within a region, is to provide a set of
    functions parallel to those availible for tokens and characters.  Since
    the logic is already designed, it seems little effort to provide these.

    However, I'm intrigued by your other suggestion, that of "repeat the
    follwing command until some condition takes place".  It would indeed
    expand the power of macros considerably, but needs some thought.  I'll
    keep in touch about it.

    Meanwhile, which system(s) do you work on?

Subject: 132-column redisplay

    When I added "Tym431 (aka ADM-11)" to Peak's redisplay, I did a differ
    with your SYDISP.SAI, and found the latter to contain code to support
    the Vt102's 132-column screen.  My question is whether this was ever
    proven to work.  If so, I should pull it over to Peak's redisplay.

    Meanwhile, the Tym431 (NTD's "new"???  terminal of choice) is
    essentially an ADM3A with a Clear-to-End-of-Line sequence equivalent to
    the 420 and 425.  I'd like to update SY at least on :36 and :930 with
    this type some time soon.
