Subject: format for error return line in YAMM

The YAMM presently uses a nice variety of formats for the error return
line in UUO's etc.  I'm not sure such a variety of formats is either
helpful or advisable.  Therefore I am soliciting opinions as to the
preferred form.  The present variety includes
	  error return		; AC/ error code
	 error return	<AC> := error code
	  error return		; ac := error code
	 error return	;  <ac> := error code
	 error return	;AC contains <error code>
	  error return	; c(<ac>) := error code
	  error return		; ac/ error code

All comments appreciated.

Well, if you haven't gotten Eileen's message (5 pages), let me know
and I'll TUMS you a copy.  Otherwise, it works like this...
    The list of addresses in (MAIL)ONTYME.DAT in the last column is
used to decide who you are.  The FROM: field is used for this.  If
there is no match, it will search all the way to the top (it searches
bottom up) to TUMS.GATEWAY and use that.  At any rate, when it finds
an entry that matches, it logs in to the appropriate ONTYME switch
(after all, you have to use the one you are valid on) and sends the
message.  If you use <name@EMSEE.Ontyme.Tymnet>, it will try to find
an entry for that host, but in the case of EMSEE, there aren't any.
    The long and short of it is that you should use the method
described in Eileen's memo until the real thing gets implemented.

    I thought I killed them all; I thought that finally I'd managed to
    squash every stinking little one of the unsavory vermin.  Yet
    somehow, like worms on the network, or athletes foot, or
    crabgrass, despite gallons of very intelligent and very costly
    pesticide, they seemed to keep marching out into my life in a
    neatly arranged, evenly spaced single file line, exactly an hour
    apart, each a near perfect clone of its predecessor.

    I speak of none other than the polite reply letters that
    (MAIL)ONTYME sends hourly in the event that the person that I
    addressed in my original message does not exist.  I speak of the
    ordeal one goes through trying to insure that a past indiscretion
    is not punished into perpituity.

    I finally deleted (MAIL)ONTYME.Q, and I hope for :930's sake that
    this will at last be the end of it (there is, after all, only so
    much disk space availible).  Do you think it might be appropriate
    for (MAIL)ONTYME a to maybe push the offending message out of the
    way until the problem with the address can be fixed?  What happens
    if only one address in a list provided to To:  or Cc:  has a
    problem?  Is the message re-sent to everyone hourly?  Was this
    what I saw on your TTY in your office?  Or was that another
    problem?

    Forgive my tone; I am not angry, just overwhelmed.

    understand it in the morning.

Subject: loops and such

Ooops, there are little problems like that that still need working out.
Remember what the U in TUMS stands for (unofficial).  Anyway, I'm working
on it.  Basically, the logic necessary to discern between a failure that
requires the message to be requeued and tried again later, verses a failure
that requires returning the unsent message to the sender is obscure at
best and certainly heuristic.  None the less, there was never any intent
to both requeue the message AND return it to sender (my, my).

As for the unfortunates who were valid recipients of the message you sent,
they probably received an equal number of copies.  I suggest you log in
to ONTYME by hand, check your out list
    :OUT OLD
and if they haven't been read, cancel them with
    :CANCEL message-number
(sigh)

If you find this amusing, you may also wish to consider the situation
that arose last week when a bug...

    AuxOut( ":SEND" );
    while Queue!Not!Empty do begin
	AuxOut( " "& Top!Of!Queue );
	Sent!To := Sent!To & Top!Of!Queue;
    end;

caused roughly 64000 copies of one particular message to get sent to
Bill Euske.  It only stopped there because the string Sent!To finally
took over the world and the string garbage collector saw fit to put
an end to its life.  (upon careful inspection, you'll notice I cleverly
neglected to "lop" off the top of the queue so it would just loop
forever sending to the first name on the list)
Fortunately, Ontyme has its bugs, too, and it ignored most of the line
because it was too long.

It doesn't appear to have been sent to anyone else, but then
its not clear.  The problem was that it never got a valid

it couldn't deliver it to the one address.  It requeud it because
it got a timeout waiting for some reply.  -Bill

Okay, a small oversight in the code.  It now sees
  NO VALID RECIPIENTS
and stops looking for 
   MSG # xxxxxx SENT xx-xxx-xx xx:xx:xx
which is what it was looking for when it timed out.
You see, trying to decide when the system has accepted your
command and is done processing it (that is, when the output
of one command ends and the next begins) you must have ESP.
Because: 
    Ontyme doesn't echo commands
    There is no prompt
    There is no uniform message sent when a command is done
    Ontyme eats yellow balls for breakfast and never spits out orange ones
        ...
    etc.

    Is it a feature of PCOM or the monitor that license passing does

    jeopardized, but the discrepency with :930's behaviour is worth
    noting.

    While we're on the subject, why is it that when I say "init<cr>"

Subject: DUSAGE, 897 and 930

Ken:
Well, all the files have default dates on SYS on 897 due to the way Dave
Sutton restored SYS last time around (he obviously did not bother to set
a correct date and time, or some such thing).

It is unreasonable to expect DUSAGE to be accurate on 930 since DUSAGE
reads the DUL, and the DUL on 930 has many, many usernames that are not
in the LUD.  Also, since we blit
hely create and delete usernames, it is
not surprising to find oddities.

To Carl and Ken:
There are two OSMAN's as Carl has moved OSMAN to GAN 3, and, it seems left
the old OSMAN in the DUL.  Carl, there should be some way we can clean up
930's DUL and get rid of all the extra names.  Good OSMAN project?  It will
teach him about the structures of the LUD and DUL, etc.

To Ken and Carl:
Another mystery solved.  DALE is in the DUL, PPN 7,257.  Someone recently
created a directory TESTING on 930, PPN 257,257.  DUSAGE must just check
the UUN for its match in the UFD (or some such--I'm not going to check the

helpful or advisable.  Therefore I am soliciting opinions as to the
preferred form.  The present variety includes
	  error return		; AC/ error code
	 error return	<AC> := error code
	  error return		; ac := error code
	 error return	;  <ac> := error code
	 error return	;AC contains <error code>

	  error return		; ac/ error code

    Jon,

    For the record, the fruits of my search for lisp for Tops-20 can
    be found on the first reel of the decus TOPS-20-LIBRARY, a copy of
    which Virgil Champlin (of DBSD) has in his office.  The savesets
    of interest are the following:

        <DECUS.20-0004>                 ; InterLisp
        <DECUS.20-0015>                 ; Lisp 1.6
        <DECUS.20-0016>                 ; MLisp

    The file MD:<DBSD.VIRGIL>20-LIBRARY-DISTRIBUTION-NOTES.MEM on
    system :94 in Fremont has some somewhat brief but nonetheless
    informative things to say about these products and their
    worthiness of trust.

    I have no readymade sources for lisp to test the functionality of
    these products, but Zonnie (or even Jon Goerke) may be of help
    there.

    :148 has been unavailible these past weeks, and therfore nothing
    has been done to insure the residency of the any of these on this
    26KL host.

Well, if you haven't gotten Eileen's message (5 pages), let me know
and I'll TUMS you a copy.  Otherwise, it works like this...
    The list of addresses in (MAIL)ONTYME.DAT in the last column is
used to decide who you are.  The FROM: field is used for this.  If
there is no match, it will search all the way to the top (it searches
bottom up) to TUMS.GATEWAY and use that.  At any rate, when it finds
an entry that matches, it logs in to the appropriate ONTYME switch
(after all, you have to use the one you are valid on) and sends the
message.  If you use <name@EMSEE.Ontyme.Tymnet>, it will try to find
an entry for that host, but in the case of EMSEE, there aren't any.
    The long and short of it is that you should use the method
described in Eileen's memo until the real thing gets implemented.

PS if they take too long to do it, I'll provide the EMSAA program
with a list of accounts so it can do the right thing

    I thought I killed them all; I thought that finally I'd managed to
    squash every stinking little one of the unsavory vermin.  Yet
    somehow, like worms on the network, or athletes foot, or
    crabgrass, despite gallons of very intelligent and very costly
    pesticide, they seemed to keep marching out into my life in a
    neatly arranged, evenly spaced single file line, exactly an hour
    apart, each a near perfect clone of its predecessor.

    I speak of none other than the polite reply letters that
    (MAIL)ONTYME sends hourly in the event that the person that I
    addressed in my original message does not exist.  I speak of the
    ordeal one goes through trying to insure that a past indiscretion
    is not punished into perpituity.

    I finally deleted (MAIL)ONTYME.Q, and I hope for :930's sake that
    this will at last be the end of it (there is, after all, only so
    much disk space availible).  Do you think it might be appropriate
    for (MAIL)ONTYME a to maybe push the offending message out of the
    way until the problem with the address can be fixed?  What happens
    if only one address in a list provided to To:  or Cc:  has a
    problem?  Is the message re-sent to everyone hourly?  Was this
    what I saw on your TTY in your office?  Or was that another
    problem?

Subject: loops and such

Ooops, there are little problems like that that still need working out.
Remember what the U in TUMS stands for (unofficial).  Anyway, I'm working
on it.  Basically, the logic necessary to discern between a failure that
requires the message to be requeued and tried again later, verses a failure
that requires returning the unsent message to the sender is obscure at
best and certainly heuristic.  None the less, there was never any intent
to both requeue the message AND return it to sender (my, my).

As for the unfortunates who were valid recipients of the message you sent,
they probably received an equal number of copies.  I suggest you log in
to ONTYME by hand, check your out list
    :OUT OLD
and if they haven't been read, cancel them with
    :CANCEL message-number
(sigh)

If you find this amusing, you may also wish to consider the situation
that arose last week when a bug...

    AuxOut( ":SEND" );
    while Queue!Not!Empty do begin
	AuxOut( " "& Top!Of!Queue );
	Sent!To := Sent!To & Top!Of!Queue;
    end;

caused roughly 64000 copies of one particular message to get sent to
Bill Euske.  It only stopped there because the string Sent!To finally
took over the world and the string garbage collector saw fit to put
an end to its life.  (upon careful inspection, you'll notice I cleverly
neglected to "lop" off the top of the queue so it would just loop
forever sending to the first name on the list)
Fortunately, Ontyme has its bugs, too, and it ignored most of the line
because it was too long.

it got a timeout waiting for some reply.  -Bill

Okay, a small oversight in the code.  It now sees
  NO VALID RECIPIENTS
and stops looking for 
   MSG # xxxxxx SENT xx-xxx-xx xx:xx:xx
which is what it was looking for when it timed out.
You see, trying to decide when the system has accepted your
command and is done processing it (that is, when the output
of one command ends and the next begins) you must have ESP.
Because: 
    Ontyme doesn't echo commands
    There is no prompt
    There is no uniform message sent when a command is done
    Ontyme eats yellow balls for breakfast and never spits out orange ones
        ...
    etc.

(don't mind me, I just need someone to complain to)  -Bill

ANYWAY - it should be fixed now!

    Jon,

    Effective June 11th, 1984, I will be working for Michael Stimac,
    Manager of the Network Tools Unit of the Network Technology
    Division of Tymshare, providing support for the runtime package of
    the Concurrent Pascal cross compiler for Tymnet Engines.  I feel
    this is best, as this represents a major career change for me, and
    brings me closer to my beloved languages.

    Yours,

    Ken Dawson

Subject: lisp in the new world

    Jon,

    For the record, the fruits of my search for lisp for Tops-20 can
    be found on the first reel of the decus TOPS-20-LIBRARY, a copy of
    which Virgil Champlin (of DBSD) has in his office.  The savesets
    of interest are the following:

        <DECUS.20-0004>                 ; InterLisp
        <DECUS.20-0015>                 ; Lisp 1.6
        <DECUS.20-0016>                 ; MLisp

    The file MD:<DBSD.VIRGIL>20-LIBRARY-DISTRIBUTION-NOTES.MEM on
    system :94 in Fremont has some somewhat brief but nonetheless
    informative things to say about these products and their
    worthiness of trust.

    I have no readymade sources for lisp to test the functionality of
    these products, but Zonnie (or even Jon Goerke) may be of help
    there.

    :148 has been unavailible these past weeks, and therfore nothing
    has been done to insure the residency of the any of these on this
    26KL host.

    Just so you know.

No, you're not hallucinating!  You did have a bunch of files on (peak.bak).
They were sucked away to tape.  Remember, this was a test, and you did say

FICHE worked.  I deleted them after I wrote them to tape.  If you really

    and it seemed to be a Rainbow w/o the processor module (with maybe
    a larger screen).  It has three varieties of communications
    interface, setup commands availible in English (as opposed to
    binary, as availible on the Rainbow), LA50 supported as the slave
    printer (including single line print capability), and an on/off
    switch.

Sendmail uses Carl's FRMRUN.  I thus refer the problem to him.
Actually, I suppose PEAK ought to enable for NTQ and ZAP and force
a checkpoint.  Note that in order to get ZAP on the command port,
you must set your mode to CONTINUE RUNNING ON DISCONNECT with SETPRV.
It would be polite to remember the previous setting and it restore it
on exit from the program.  -Bill

Subject: SAT files.

They disappear generally in the first few weeks of a new month,
i.e. the ones for one of the previous months.  Generally this is
to insure that they exist on an all-files tape, although since we
don't keep all-files for very long, this may or may not be useful.

Lately, since we are not so short of space, I've been trying to
keep the current quarter on-line.  The beginning of July should see
the removal of APRIL,MAY and JUNE!

If you need space, say so, and after I run my statistics program, I
will discard the .SAT files.

As per a suggestion by LOIS (and others) the file (M33:930)HOTLINE.LOG
now contains a reverse-chronological log of HOTLINE calls, giving the
approximate date and time of the call, who it was take by, who is to be
contacted, system #, description of problem, solution if known, and the
current status, i.e. PENDING, FIXED, HOLD, etc.

The file is also an INFO node, for somewhat page-able access to recent
problems.  Anyone taking a call should try to look at the file and update
it where applicable.  This should help to keep down the incidence of
multiple people working on the same problem without knowing what has been
done already.  (The info node is "HOTLINE" under node "SUPPORT").

Subject: pcom and license passing on :39

    Carl,

    Is it a feature of PCOM or the monitor that license passing does
    not work on :39?  The only way I can get my tiny little child
    frame to do grownup things is to explicitly set license in the CTL
    file.  Naturally, this can be accomplished through watertight and
    surrepetitious means, so that the security of life an large is not
    jeopardized, but the discrepency with :930's behaviour is worth
    noting.

    While we're on the subject, why is it that when I say "init<cr>"
    on :930 it runs my Init File (ala noname), but on :39 is just says
    EXIT?

I discovered that Bill's find does do somethings differently.  Major 
difference appears to be a case match match rather than case independent.
Also no double spacing (which is a plus).  First is rather a minus for

Ken:
Well, all the files have default dates on SYS on 897 due to the way Dave
Sutton restored SYS last time around (he obviously did not bother to set
a correct date and time, or some such thing).

It is unreasonable to expect DUSAGE to be accurate on 930 since DUSAGE
reads the DUL, and the DUL on 930 has many, many usernames that are not
in the LUD.  Also, since we blit
hely create and delete usernames, it is
not surprising to find oddities.

    at the TymcomX (36-bit) Group, I get the impression that I have
    been made an example by nodes higher up the tree.  Other
    transactions of this type in earlier times have succeeded on a
    much friendlier plane.

    I probably will not remit to them until I have something to plug
    in at home.

    Also in the process of speaking to the last remaining natives in
    the 36-bit world, I heard some interest in moving over to NTD.  If
    you're interested in hearing about the people invloved, let me
    know.

Subject: COEES Sail problem

    Carl, Jon, whomever:

    A fellow calling himself INSD.J/O'CONNELL ((201)981-2879) called
    me from Newark New Jersey or some such place complaining that
    COEES is having trouble recompiling their SAIL INIT programs on
    :29, even though said programs reportedly compile fine on :36.  A
    clue is that they use (FTSYS)SAIL.  My guess is they include some
    horrible module which on :29 was not compiled under the same
    version of the SAIL compiler as the one on :36.

    I looked at the version of SAIL on both systems, and find no
    discrepencies.  Since it's not my job to handle this kind of
    stuff, I'll let you deal with it further.

Ken:
A little thought reveals that all of those who left the section, but
stayed with Tymshare in the last three years, kept their home terminals.
More or less in order, that is Scott, Bill, Tim (who just had a modem),
Greg, Vivian, and Mike.  Rather than an unusual exception, you were the
norm.  The only thing different about your case, is that you had a
Rainbow.

It was great seeing you yesterday.  Keep me up on your news.

Subject: Request for New Port I/O Operation in Pascal Nucleus

Re our conversation today, I am requesting that a new port I/O operation
be added to the Pascal Nucleus - a Leave Deferred Echo Mode operation.
I would like it to ONLY send a LDEM message out over the port, and NOT
affect anything that the Nucleus does in terms of handling echo, deferred
echo, etc.  I need this to handle echoing through X.25/X.75 gateways in
the ELF program.

The current Betatest version of ELF (3.08, released July 18, 1984),
includes a patch to send a LDEM when a "B6" message is received.  A "B6"
message indicates that an auxilliary circuit has successfully been built.
I have included the patch here...if you have any questions, contact me...

Thanks - Jill (Ext. 6330, jmarcin@39, ntd.j/neidrauer@ontyme)

Note: The line feeds were removed from the following to make it more
readable..."stuff to fit in patch" is needed to have the current B6
code work...

    Jon,

    I got a call from a Ron Vivier about his travels in Europe, and
    the demand he ran into from the European affiliates for User
    availibility of Peak on Tymcom-X.  As you know, to date we've had
    an explicit test for the Tymshare Internal Bit in Peak as a means
    of preventing real users from using it.  I told Ron that there is
    no documentation worthy of a general user's consideration, and he
    said that they (the European Operations types making the request)
    were aware of that, but these were no normal users.  In fact, they
    (either the Operations people or the users in question) might very
    well write their own manual for Peak!

    Our options at present are to either continue our past practice of
    adding these users to the execption list, or removing the filter
    altogether, and making it publicly usable.  (In the case of the
    latter, finding out what the "writing their own manual" really
    means would be a good idea.)

    I was wondering about your thoughts on the matter.

         The peculiar thing about ontyme seems to be that while you can
         save the contents of a message in a file, you must loose the
         message header.  I had to use PEAK to capture an image of your
         last message.

so there.

Subject: give me a break 

You may or may not have received a thoroughly mutilated message from me
originated on :36 a little before 8pm.  I hope you did, just so I can see
what actually wound up in the message after the operator was through with
me.

I'm unimpressed with ADM3A's:  while writing a great invective to you on
another topic, the system decided to warn me about its impending shutdown.
Strange things happened to my buffer, garbage like I've been looking at and
listening to all day appeared all over my screen.  "No biggie", thought I,
"I'll just hit this little ^L key, (like I've done a thousand times
before), and the screen will be repainted in its original form, and I'll be
OK."  Silly boy.  The refuse resulting from the interruption was INSERTED
INTO MY EDIT BUFFER!

"Piece of cake", says I, "I'll just delete the crud, and go on."  (Can you
guess what's coming?)

Yes, the message began coming once every ten or twenty seconds, and I
couldn't delete the refuse fast enough even to tred water (or "sewage", as
the case may be).

Then the system died, and my unconscious body was left drift among the
reefs and kelp beds until it came aground on system :39.

The simplicity of the design of the ADM3A is truly horrifying, and not to
be tolerated.

fondly,

Subject: Tymshare Unofficial Mail System

Its here folks!
You can send mail with the command
    SENDMAil name@host,name@host,name@host ... name@host
It will prompt you for a subject and the body of the message.  While
you are entering the body, you have the choice of including a file
or calling an editor.  These options are invoked with ~ commands...type
~? for a list of valid commands.  The ~ must be in column one.

You can read mail (as you have obviously discovered) by the command
    RDMAIL
It will display your mail and append it to the file MAIL in your home
directory.

You can only send to "known" hosts which currently include:
    39,57,897,930
    tymix	(NTD's VAX)
    OFFICE	(no need to specify which one)
    ONTYME
I will add other hosts on request.  Send requests to WRS@39.

Notes on OFFICE:
    They can't send mail back to us yet (their restriction).
    Sending to name@host.ARPA will forward via OFFICE-14 to the
    DARPA internet, however, the OFFICE host tables are not complete
    so some ARPA hosts may appear to not be there in which case you'll
    get the mail back with a non-delivery explanation.

Notes on ONTYME:
    If you wish to receive your ONTYME mail through TUMS, you
    need to register your account.  If you are self-confident,
    you can edit (MAIL)ONTYME.DAT - follow the examples exactly!
    Otherwise, send your ONTYME account name(s) and passwords to
    me at WRS@39.  Also, if you register, mail that you send will
    show up as from your account rather than TUMS.GATEWAY which
    might confuse the more narrow minded Ontyme users.

Features forthcoming:
    *	more hosts
    *	better user interface
    *	automatic forwarding
    *	mailing lists

Please report bugs, problems, suggestions and praise to
	    WRS@39
-Bill

P.S.
If you find that SENDMAIL doesn't work as a command, you may use
    R SENDmail
or, include the line
    SetSCM( "(XEXEC)MEXEC" );
in your INIT.SAI.  (you should do this anyway)  If you're not using
.SAI init file, look at procedure SetSCM in (WRS)SETTRM.SAI and
duplicate its functionality in whatever you do use.  If you don't
understand why you should use SCM, call me and I'll tell you, it'd
be nice to hear from you anyway.  -Bill

Subject: editors get a fair slice of the machine

I thought you might be interested in these statistics.  Notice the
standing of PEAK, VUE and EDITOR.  My experience seems to indicate
that these pretty well represent the amount of use they get as
opposed to their relative efficiency.  And by the way, if anyone
knows how to make the concurrent pascal compiler (39.42%) run any
faster you could save NTD a great deal of money.  -Bill

PS - this program (WRS:39)TRSTAT won't run on F3's due to its use
of double precision floating point, it might be fun to run on some
of the other systems though.

This chart lists the top users of system 39 by program name for the first
week of May 1984.  I hope that you will find this as intersting as I have.
I will run the program again later in the month when more data is available.

I mean that I believe that its high rank indicates it is prefered.  Most
of the people I know use it, and the ones that use VUE are planning on
switching.  Considering that more programmer time is spent editing than
anything else, using only 5% of the system is great for a full screen
editor.  -Bill

    When 554 hiccoughs and we are exercising our right to ~v, even
    though the SENDMA frame is detached, in TI mode, and relatively
    happy, the PEAK frame is gone, and unless there is a checkpoint
    file, so is the text of the message.  Is there some quality which
    the child is missing which might allow it to persist so that I

Actually, I suppose PEAK ought to enable for NTQ and ZAP and force
a checkpoint.  Note that in order to get ZAP on the command port,
you must set your mode to CONTINUE RUNNING ON DISCONNECT with SETPRV.
It would be polite to remember the previous setting and it restore it
on exit from the program.  -Bill

Subject: WARP (for PEAK) is here

The file (SAILIB)WARP.DOC is on 39 and 930.  It describes the routine
WARP, and the program WARPLD.  This is the code I spoke of for PEAK to
cut down on the initialization delay and increase sharability.  The file
is included below for reference.

(SAILIB)WARP.REQ					(SAILIB)WARP.REQ

    Summary:
	Generate execution checkpoint file for later execution.

    Usage:
	string filename;
	WARP( filename );

    Description:
	Call WARP to create a file that may be loaded and executed by WARPLD.
	Should be called immediately following initialization.  Restrictions:
	no files or interrupts may be open, no instantiation dependent code

Subject: PEAK Tutorial

Ken:
The present PEAK tutorial says to send mail to LOIS on 33 with comments.
Under the circumstances that seems unwise.  I want to transmit a new tutorial
with either a new username to send mail to or without that section entirely,
ending with logging out. 

Suggestions?  Comments?

    It seems to me that once TUMS/InterOntyme, and other pies in the
    collective sky are in place, we should establish a canonical help
    mail drop (perhaps on Ontyme?).  It seems that once, in Camelot,
    we had one, and we even occasionally looked at it.  I hesitate to
    say that Peak problems constitute the National Emergency that -
    say - DSKCLN getting hungry one rainy night and going on a rampage
    might pose, but at the same time, asking the Folks At Home to send
    their cards and letters to the Dead Letter Office is also a bit
    rude.

Subject: department of interesting statistics

I thought of an interesting statistic that you're in a position
to gather (if you still have access to Peak now that you're at
NTD (congrats)).  The average number of characters (from the
buffer) that are involved in a redisplay.  I.e.  how dense is
the information on the display?  I'm guessing about 80% for text,
and maybe 30-40% for programs.

If you're curious ...

   Now in theory, this mail will get to you at tolerant, and you will
   be able to rely via the path which calls itself

       oliveb!tymix!ken%930.Tymnet

   To send mail to wrs, use the following path:

   Let me know if you receive this.  Let me know if you don't.

Subject: Tymshare Unofficial Mail System

Its here folks!
You can send mail with the command
    SENDMAil name@host,name@host,name@host ... name@host
It will prompt you for a subject and the body of the message.  While
you are entering the body, you have the choice of including a file
or calling an editor.  These options are invoked with ~ commands...type
~? for a list of valid commands.  The ~ must be in column one.

You can read mail (as you have obviously discovered) by the command
    RDMAIL
It will display your mail and append it to the file MAIL in your home
directory.

You can only send to "known" hosts which currently include:
    39,57,897,930
    tymix	(NTD's VAX)
    OFFICE	(no need to specify which one)
    ONTYME
I will add other hosts on request.  Send requests to WRS@39.

Notes on OFFICE:
    They can't send mail back to us yet (their restriction).
    Sending to name@host.ARPA will forward via OFFICE-14 to the
    DARPA internet, however, the OFFICE host tables are not complete
    so some ARPA hosts may appear to not be there in which case you'll
    get the mail back with a non-delivery explanation.

Notes on ONTYME:
    If you wish to receive your ONTYME mail through TUMS, you
    need to register your account.  If you are self-confident,
    you can edit (MAIL)ONTYME.DAT - follow the examples exactly!
    Otherwise, send your ONTYME account name(s) and passwords to
    me at WRS@39.  Also, if you register, mail that you send will
    show up as from your account rather than TUMS.GATEWAY which
    might confuse the more narrow minded Ontyme users.

Features forthcoming:
    *	more hosts
    *	better user interface
    *	automatic forwarding
    *	mailing lists

Please report bugs, problems, suggestions and praise to
	    WRS@39
-Bill

P.S.
If you find that SENDMAIL doesn't work as a command, you may use
    R SENDmail
or, include the line
    SetSCM( "(XEXEC)MEXEC" );
in your INIT.SAI.  (you should do this anyway)  If you're not using
.SAI init file, look at procedure SetSCM in (WRS)SETTRM.SAI and
duplicate its functionality in whatever you do use.  If you don't
understand why you should use SCM, call me and I'll tell you, it'd
be nice to hear from you anyway.  -Bill

Subject: editors get a fair slice of the machine

I thought you might be interested in these statistics.  Notice the
standing of PEAK, VUE and EDITOR.  My experience seems to indicate
that these pretty well represent the amount of use they get as
opposed to their relative efficiency.  And by the way, if anyone
knows how to make the concurrent pascal compiler (39.42%) run any
faster you could save NTD a great deal of money.  -Bill

PS - this program (WRS:39)TRSTAT won't run on F3's due to its use
of double precision floating point, it might be fun to run on some
of the other systems though.

This chart lists the top users of system 39 by program name for the first
week of May 1984.  I hope that you will find this as intersting as I have.
I will run the program again later in the month when more data is available.

I didn't check Wipes, but I tried using it for Copies, and spent
about 20 minutes going through a source to pull out sections of

Bill has told me that space can be compacted by reducing the
actual number of directories on ONTYME by using an alias.  I
would like to know if you would like me to cancel either of
TXS.PEAK or TXS.K/DAWSON, and/or make PEAK an alias of K/DAWSON?
(I ask, since you're not really expecting much to be sent to
 K/DAWSON under TXS, since you have NTD.K/Dawson, right?)

Subject: Timer-Checkpointing Peak V2.0(311)

    Bill,

    It works!  Let's hope that response improves at least noticably,
    if not incredibly.

    It seems that there were a few minor type-o's involved in my
    transcription of the immediate interrupt routine.  This of course
    paralysed the whole mechanism.  Once those were cleaned up, the
    rest was history.

    Although I'm not sure, it appears that the routine actually doing
    the checkpoint - invoked either by the hand-made polling point at
    the character input UUO or at the top of the command loop - MUST
    be a nonsimple procedure.  Otherwise, it seems, the string stack
    gets a bit lost and our [Checkpoint] message never appears.

    A point of disk usage and aesthetics:  The current version will
    cause a Checkpoint to occur every CheckpointInterval seconds as
    long as the buffer continues to be modified.  The earlier version
    of course would Checkpoint only after the keyboard had been idle
    for that period of time.  Despite its generating higher disk
    traffic, the former would seem the more reasonable interpretation.
    I wonder if you can find a basis to disagree.

    Anyway, what fun!  See you later.

    Yes, it's true!  The latest version of Peak, though lacking the
    incredible WARPLD fast-start feature, does have timer-generated
    checkpointing, and therefore spends the bulk of its time in TI
    (rather than SL) state.  This should result in a greater rapport
    with the Tymcom-X scheduler, making the Peak experience a bit
    friskier in loaded situations.

    Let me know if you notice any problems arising from this giant
    leap in Technology.  Use SENDMA.

Subject: Redisp & V2.0(313)

    Carl,

    Regretably, in accomplishing the last magic improvment to Peak
    (Checkpointing by timer), I had to make the redisplay know things
    about the command module that in other applications it has no
    business knowing.  To wit:

        o   external procedure C!DoChkPnt
        o   external boolean   C!TimIntFlg

    The unclean intelligence, fortunately, is confined to the routine
    T!GetC, which gets the next character(s) from the terminal.  The
    reason for its existence is that we must simulate a SAIL polling
    point in order to perform a checkpoint while we are in terminal
    input wait.  If you are curious about the mechanism, take a look
    at T!GetC.

    Sorry about the mess.

Subject: Setting Terminal Type & Peak

    Bill,

    Besides setting the TTY CLASS via the monitor command, as I
    described to you yesterday, there is a way to set the terminal
    type while still in Peak.

        $xset terminal type$vt102$

    This will reset the terminal type for the duration of the current
    edit session, and will not affect the setting of the TTY CLASS
    "variable" for the current job.

Subject: Users using Peak?

    Jon,

    I got a call from a Ron Vivier about his travels in Europe, and
    the demand he ran into from the European affiliates for User
    availibility of Peak on Tymcom-X.  As you know, to date we've had
    an explicit test for the Tymshare Internal Bit in Peak as a means
    of preventing real users from using it.  I told Ron that there is
    no documentation worthy of a general user's consideration, and he
    said that they (the European Operations types making the request)
    were aware of that, but these were no normal users.  In fact, they
    (either the Operations people or the users in question) might very
    well write their own manual for Peak!

    Our options at present are to either continue our past practice of
    adding these users to the execption list, or removing the filter
    altogether, and making it publicly usable.  (In the case of the
    latter, finding out what the "writing their own manual" really
    means would be a good idea.)

    I was wondering about your thoughts on the matter.

    /ken

    PS:  Each path is equally easy to implement.

I have had a request from Peter Stratman, CEGI-Tymshare, for PEAK to be
made available for customer use.  I have checked with Jon, who tells me
to do it, with the explicit provision that we will provide no support.

The only work I see necessary to carry this out is:  1.)  remove the
test for the Tymshare bit in the program, 2.)  the creation of a pricing
schedule, and 3.)  transmittal of the files to the CEGI hosts.  the only
files that I know to be needed by the program and users are:
(SYSNEWS) PEAK.CHT, PEAK.KEY, PEAK.NEW, PEAK.SUM, PEAK.TXT, PEAK.TUT and
(SYS) PEAK.SAV, PEAK.HLP

Please let me know of anything I've missed or any problems we might
encounter.  Please copy Jon on your answer.

Thanks!

The provision of "no support" sounds nice on paper, but it doesn't hold
water for a product like PEAK.

I'd like to know the following:
   1)  Does CEGI use the Tymshare bit for anything?
       i.e. do any of their programs check for it?
   2)  Do they restrict their customers in any way?
   3)  Do their customers have regular TYMNET access, i.e. TYMNET usernames
       or are they all "only" on the 2020's ((and their 1 KL)).

Depending upon the answers to these questions, HOW to release PEAK to their
users will change.

An aside:  Since Ken Dawson is working for TYMNET again, (as of last wednesday)
           there may be some development work on PEAK in the forseeable future
           and quite possibly, he could make the necessary changes for CEGI for
           us.

One more question for CEGI: How many customer groups do they have?  GAN's...
   PEAK has an internal list of customers who may use it, and depending upon
   their needs, that list could be augmented, or made external, so that CEGI
   could restrict or allow usage of PEAK on a customer by customer basis.

Let me know what you find out.
/Carl

PS:  Until it is decided that PEAK is error-free enough for general customer
     use, I'm against removing the TYMSHARE-BIT restriction.  Especially if
     we're not supporting it!!!!!

These are Tymcom-X systems that we're talking about, aren't they?  When you
get the info you need, I'll be glad to make the modifications necessary.

Like you, I hesitate to shut off Tymshare-bit testing unless we do
something radical like releasing it to the world, with all the hoopla that
that implies.

Thanks for remembering me.

Re:    An idea for an enhancement to PEAK.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a former VUE user, I was trying to do the "Invert Case in Region" function
in PEAK and discovered that it did not exist.  "No problem," I thought.  "I'll
just create my own macro and bind it to some key sequence."  Then I discovered
that it was impossible to even do this (unless I have overlooked something or
you have an unpublished PEAK function).

In my labors to create such a macro, what I needed was a new function similar
to this:  "Repeat the next function until mark (or end-of-line, paragraph,
window, page, etc.)"  Then, I could have defined a region in a macro and
repeated the "Toggle Case of Character" to the end of the region.  I'm sure
that this "Repeat" function would be very useful to create other nice macros.

I don't know if anyone is chartered to add enhancements to PEAK, but I would
vote to add this sort of "Repeat" function.

Thanks for listening.

Subject: PEAK - Toggle case in region, etc

    Craig,

    It seems clear that the easiest solution to the problem at hand, the
    inability to modify case within a region, is to provide a set of
    functions parallel to those availible for tokens and characters.  Since
    the logic is already designed, it seems little effort to provide these.

    However, I'm intrigued by your other suggestion, that of "repeat the
    follwing command until some condition takes place".  It would indeed
    expand the power of macros considerably, but needs some thought.  I'll
    keep in touch about it.

    Meanwhile, which system(s) do you work on?

    When I added "Tym431 (aka ADM-11)" to Peak's redisplay, I did a differ
    with your SYDISP.SAI, and found the latter to contain code to support
    the Vt102's 132-column screen.  My question is whether this was ever
    proven to work.  If so, I should pull it over to Peak's redisplay.

    Meanwhile, the Tym431 (NTD's "new"???  terminal of choice) is
    essentially an ADM3A with a Clear-to-End-of-Line sequence equivalent to
    the 420 and 425.  I'd like to update SY at least on :36 and :930 with
    this type some time soon.

I know that this sounds like "begging", but did Tim leave any info about
the whereabouts of various things for F40, LIB40, etc... with anyone?
I nee to find some sources, and I'm hard pressed to admit that we can't
get the sources, even if we have to DISREL them from the .REL files!!!

Hi,
  do you happen to know **ANYTHING** about CARMEL, the FUDGE2 replacement
that F40 is setup with?  I can't find **ANY** transmittals or documentation
on it...   /Carl

Sorry I don't know anything about it.  I take it that it's not embedded
in F40's transmittal package? How about some other possible embedding?

Thanks... I just stopped by the office, & at least there's something in
Lois' office on CARMEL, albeit not much!

As for other embedding, it might not be a bad idea, except there seem to
be a couple of "weird" link block-types in some of the .REL files, unless

Oh!  (the reason for the subject: Faith!)  I don't have any for the actual
workings of LIB40, F40, et al as far as the people at tymshare who have
worked (repeat "worked") on it since 1977.  I had Bob Jacobs who works for
Dave miller show me how to use the ARCHIVE data base, and found old-old-old
transmittals (and archived FDM files) for soures that have been "presumed"
LOST for the past 8-10 years.  All I had to do was LOOK, and then restore
the files to see what they contained!!!!!!!!!!  So, I now have sources to
many of the so-called LOST LIB40 routines!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have no faith in the work done by certain individuals!!!!!!!!

It seems that I was granted a default disk in/out quota of a paltry 1250
pages on system 36.  This is inadequate to build a copy of the ontyme
product from (osiris).  I attempted to give myself enough quota via NONAME,
and it seems I NEED WC license to do so, or I must come crawling to someone
thus endowed in order to get on with my job.  Could you arrange appropriate

You may or may not have received a thoroughly mutilated message from me
originated on :36 a little before 8pm.  I hope you did, just so I can see
what actually wound up in the message after the operator was through with
me.

I'm unimpressed with ADM3A's:  while writing a great invective to you on
another topic, the system decided to warn me about its impending shutdown.
Strange things happened to my buffer, garbage like I've been looking at and
listening to all day appeared all over my screen.  "No biggie", thought I,
"I'll just hit this little ^L key, (like I've done a thousand times
before), and the screen will be repainted in its original form, and I'll be
OK."  Silly boy.  The refuse resulting from the interruption was INSERTED
INTO MY EDIT BUFFER!

"Piece of cake", says I, "I'll just delete the crud, and go on."  (Can you
guess what's coming?)

Yes, the message began coming once every ten or twenty seconds, and I
couldn't delete the refuse fast enough even to tred water (or "sewage", as
the case may be).

Then the system died, and my unconscious body was left drift among the
reefs and kelp beds until it came aground on system :39.

The simplicity of the design of the ADM3A is truly horrifying, and not to
be tolerated.

To : ONTYME development & support group

From : Jenny Shen

Subject : message in-seq-number out of order problem


  Two reasons have been found for this problem:

  1)  In READ_CLASS (msred0.osi), procedure move_msg_to_in_old updates
      the in_seq_no in systemglobalinfoarea (sgiam0.osi) by passing a
      value to sga instead of decrementing the in_seq_no there.  This
      may cause the problem  if more than one users have logged on using
      the same user name and all do read operation.

  2)  The in_seq_no in user profile gets updated and the profile is
      written back to disk when the user logs off.  Some exceptions are
      if the user issues READ ALL command or he tries to read msg, but
      there is no more msg on his in list, in_seq_no gets updated from
      sga and the profile is written back to disk;  if abnormal logoff
      occurs like timeout or circuit lost, in_seq_no gets updated and
      the profile is written to disk.  However, if the system crashes
      before the process gets to the logoff procedure, the profile on 
      the disk still has the old values.  Next time the user logs on,
      the in_seq_no will be the old one.

  solution:

  1)  For reason 1), a procedure decrement_inseqno is added in sga
      to decrement the present value of in_seq_no.  The call to set_
      inseqno in procedure move_msg_to_in_old is changed to decrement_inseqno.

  2)  The possible change for reason 2) would add disk I/O operations.
      So there will not be any change at this point.


  This problem has been there for quite a long time.  We probably will
see it more later.  This message is for your reference.

Skywalker is what many people tried to tell management they should have
been doing in place of super-engine 3 years ago.  Its basically a bus
oriented engine that'll allow multiple engine CPU's to be plugged in to
the same bus with (possibly) other CPU's (like 68K's).  We've decided
to use VME bus so we'll be able to buy stuff off the shelf if we don't
feel like making it in-house.  REAL distributed processing!  CHEAP!

    What is the intent of FDM's design with regard to multiple instances of

I won't go into much detail... but (SAILIB)MFDSCN is the stuff that
I told you about.  There are a bunch of programs that I've put together
that use it.  It's much cleaner than the hack in EXTEND which is shown
in INFO on system 33 (I think!).

FINDIT in (CB-SAIL) is probably the best example using just the data
       returned from the .CHUFD CHANIO call.
UNIQUE in (CARL) also uses the .CHUFD data in a slightly different
       way.  First making a list, then printing out the results.

there are lots more... however, I will go and make a copy with the
procedures turned into SIMPLE and see if it (a) works and (b) is any
faster.  /Carl

Look at (CB-SAIL)COUNT.SAI
it is a very "boring" program which uses MFDSCN.
It merely counts all UFD's and all files.

I tried it with "SIMPLE" vs non-"SIM<PLE" and it seems to be
a tiny bit faster on 930.  Two times each, SCOUNT.SAV (slow) was 118
seconds for 45K files, and COUNT (simple) was 117 seconds.

I ran them on 39, and the results across 65.5K files was inconclusive
while I was NOT the only user.  Setting SCHPRV didn't make much of a
difference, although SCOUNT took 3:51.6 and COUNT took 3:38.8 that
time.  I'm having problems with my MODEM dropping chars, so.. till
later...

    Carl,

    I have my copy here at work.  I looked, and it seems that the length of
    the stuff being reduced on the stack is known because the production's
    identity is somehow encoded in the state identity.  I think that in the
    case of states with more than one reduction (involving different
    productions), some arbitrary rule is used to determine which gets
    selected.

    What I can't seem to determine without gobs of reading is what the GOTO
    of a reduce state is.  It needs further study, but if you're in the
    neighborhood, you can take a look.

Well,
  I got frustrated and decided to finally bite the bullet!  Take a

planning on trying to implement for a file-spec parser/scanner.

  The *** TOPS-10 *** states are defined for completeness and may
or may not be available in the final description.  I will probably
pass a data address to the routine which then fills in the following
data fields:
  DEVICE, FILE, EXT, PPN/USERNAME/PATH, PROTECTION,
      FILE-MASK, EXT-MASK, PPN/PATH-MASK.

  Maybe, a count can be passed so you can get only those fields that
you want... sigh...  When I get the SAIL code written, I'll send you a
pointer to the sources.

    Someone is to be congratulated; the notes are much better than anything
    I've seen yet "explaining" Ontyme.  The tapes seem to have holes,
    unless some are missing.  I was trying to establish a correspondence
    between tape side and note packet, when I noted that some packets seem
    to not have tapes associated with them.

    Do you know whether all sessions were taped?

I think that all the sessions were taped -- or at least they were intended
to be.  But there is always a possibility of pilot error.  Stuart may
remember.

    Carl,

    PLEASE update the MFDSCN doc file to reflect the CORRECT argument list
    for the user-supplied procedure FileProc!!!!  The second parameter,
    Count, is not mentioned, except in your example (aka Count(.SAI)), and
    the results of leaving it out are serious and subtle.

    Thanks for your attention, etc etc etc

    Bill,

    I thought you might like to know that Virgil was able to make the
    interface between office-1 (?)  and arpanet work correctly for the
    first time yesterday.  Is this the big breakthrough TUMS was waiting
    for to be able to get through to arpanet?

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 20 Sep 85



To:       All ISG Employees

Subject:  ISG EDUCATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT



Employees are encouraged to increase their capabilities and 
value to ISG by participating in approved educational programs, 
whereby the costs of the educational program are refunded to the 
employee to the extent specified in this policy.

This program is applicable to all full time regular employees of 
ISG employing companies as designated by the ISG Management 
Committee.

Career development programs eligible for reimbursement fall into 
two (2) categories as follows:

1.  Adult Education Program

    The Adult Education Program provides assistance to employees 
    participating in non-credit courses designed to develop 
    potential capabilities.  The Adult Education Program 
    consists of the following:

    - High school equivalency preparation
    - High school diploma
    - Remedial education
    - Job related vocational courses

2.  College Study Program

    A program which falls into one of the following categories:

          Job related: An educational program which when taken, 
          is expected to improve the employee's performance in 
          his/her current position and/or increase the 
          employee's capabilities for promotion into a higher 
          position within ISG organizations.

          Certificate/Degree related:  An undergraduate or post 
          graduate curriculum at an accredited college or 
          university which is related to the employee's 
          profession or other business related professions which 
          the employee intends to pursue within ISG 
          organizations.



Eligibility

    To be eligible for reimbursement of educational costs, an 
    employee must be a full-time regular employee at the time of 
    enrollment and at the time the course is successfully 
    completed.  In addition, the employee must be in an active 
    pay status at the time of course completion and must not be 
    on a leave of absence.  Those who retire, are laid-off, or 
    enter active United States military service after 
    enrollment, but prior to course completion, may be eligible 
    for reimbursement, provided all other requirements have been 
    met.

    The course or program must be conducted by an approved 
    and/or accredited educational institution.

    Courses, programs and subjects undertaken must receive 
    approval by employee's supervisor and acknowledgments by 
    their local Human Resources organization prior to the start 
    of the course.

    An employee who is eligible for tuition assistance through 
    veterans' benefits, federal aid, scholarship or other such 
    programs after reporting such eligibility, may be eligible 
    for that portion not covered as specified in this policy.

Enrollment

    Employees will be limited to enrollment in not more than two 
    (2) courses plus one (1) lab per semester.

    ISG reserves the right to exclude from inclusion in this 
    plan any educational institution.

Reimbursement

    Upon satisfactory completion of each college study course (a 
    minimum grade of "C" or equivalent, provided "C" meets the 
    school requirements for degree objective), 80% of tuition, 
    enrollment fees, textbooks, required instructional material, 
    laboratory, and other recurring fees will be reimbursed.  
    Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not 
    reimbursable.  Grades are based upon an A, B, C, D, and F 
    scale.  In Adult education programs which are graded "A" 
    thru "F", the "C" grade rule applies for eligibility for 
    reimbursement.  Other evidences of satisfactory completion, 
    such as diplomas, certificates or letters from the 
    institution are acceptable when no grades are given.

    Maximum employee reimbursement per calendar year is $3,000 
    and presentation of evidence of course/program completion, 
    grades and receipts are required.



Reimbursement  (Continued)

    The Educational Reimbursement Plan is not a contract.  It 
    may be terminated or modified at any time without prior 
    notice.

    Currently, educational refunds to ISG personnel are not 
    subject to income tax withholding or reporting to the 
    Internal Revenue Service.

Educational Leave of Absence

    Leaves of absence for educational purposes are prepared and 
    approved the same as all other leaves of absence, with the 
    exception that approval of the cognizant Department Head and 
    Human Resources is also required.

    Reimbursement of expenses while on a leave of absence is not 
    authorized, except for those pursuing a Doctorate Degree, in 
    which case reimbursement is limited to a maximum of twelve 
    (12) months during required residency.

Reduced Work Week For Educational Purposes

    The reduced work week is authorized for graduate degree 
    programs only and requires the approval of the cognizant 
    Department Head and Human Resources.  The reduced work week 
    permits salaried employees to work not less than twenty (20) 
    hours nor more than forty (40) hours per week.  This plan 
    stipulates that salaried employees be paid based on actual 
    hours worked.  Those benefits available immediately prior to 
    the beginning of the reduced work week will be retained.  
    The work schedule is established not normally to exceed 
    eight (8) hours per day.

Approval of Educational Program

    Employees applying for educational reimbursement will 
    complete an "ISG Educational Reimbursement Application" at 
    least two (2) weeks prior to the first class meeting.  The 
    application must be approved by the employee's supervisor 
    and acknowledged by their local Human Resources organization 
    to assure consistency related to guidelines.

    Human Resources will review the application and notify the 
    supervisor of approval of disapproval.  The supervisor will 
    then notify the employee.  If the application is not 
    approved, the employee will be informed of the reason.



Obtaining Reimbursement

    Upon completion of the course(s) and no later than ten (10) 
    weeks from the last scheduled meeting of the course, the 
    employee must submit to Human Resources:

          An official grade report or other evidence 
          establishing satisfactory completion of the course(s) 
          as specified under the "Reimbursement" section.

          Official receipts showing actual costs paid for 
          tuition, required textbooks, and other eligible course 
          fees paid to the educational institution.

    Human Resources will complete the authorization section 
    showing approved costs reimbursable on the "ISG Educational 
    Reimbursement Application".  The authorization is then 
    forwarded to Accounts Payable for payment to the employee.

    When a course is not completed but it can be clearly shown 
    that non-completion was due to Company action, other than 
    discharge for cause, the refund may be granted provided that 
    all other conditions are met.

Ciao!!  /Carl

    Lu,

    While I'm thinking about it, are the files in accounts (PARNES) and
    (GRANO) on 930 of any value to you?  If not, we've been having some
    severe diskspace problems that deleting them might help remedy.  The
    directory lists follow:

Dear Ken,

I forgot all about 930 since he was moved to Fremont.  We have our source

Subject: FDM crash

    Carl,

    Consider the following:

        !do fdm

        [FDM File Utility %0.7]

        FDM> o stat
        [Old file: STAT]

        % GetWord MFP error: 5,,6
        Called from 35612  Last SAIL call at 16655
        ?^C
        !

    STAT, it turns out, is a real file having nothing to do with FDM.  The
    probem appears to be that it found the wrong file and then didn't like
    the fact that it was the wrong file - in a major way.  PCOM does this
    too, finding the wrong file, favoring no extension to the logical
    default extension.  It seems like an easy fix. If you want to specify
    no extension, you say "STAT.".

Subject: Re: Your comment about FILE vs FILE. 

I'd agree that defaults should be defaulted when not specified... but
there is some doubt about when it's specified and when it isn't.  There
is no clear-cut definition about that... i.e.  DIR X  vs  DIR X.*  for
example.  Should both be equivalent?  Sometimes I wish they were and
sometimes I'm glad they're not.  I opt for DIR X  and DIR X.* to mean the
same and if the person says DIR X. then s/he means "X" without a .EXT

When defaulting  to .CTL  or .FDM   what I do, just so people who don't
know any better feel that it's right... I look for X without an extension
and if found, that is used.  Otherwise, I look for X.CTL or X.FDM and if
that's found, I use that.  If it isn't found, I use that anyway... sigh!

If you say OPEN X.  then it should override the ".FDM", although at the
moment I don't know what it does.
