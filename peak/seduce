                                  Seduced


I want to be seduced
Want a woman to take me out to dinner for two
I like to see her eyes getting moody
flirting with the thought of what flirting ought to do
I like to be real cool
Let her think about getting little me in bed
There's a chat about Magna Carta, Puerto Vallarta, something Ghandi said
I might demur politely all despite me if she tried to fondle my knee
But I'm relatively certain I'd compromise if I know me

I want to be seduced
Want a woman to talk to me suggestively
Want to hear her say she'll be with me tomorrow morning
drinking hot jasmine tea
Want her to make me laugh
Make a point of touching me when she talks
Leaving all the jealous men in the joint to mumble in their beer and gawk
I know it only happens when I'm napping, nodding in a reverie
and I find myself a woman that wouldn't mind seducing me

I know it only happens when I'm napping, nodding in a reverie
and I find myself a woman that wouldn't mind seducing
Starting form the moment that we've been introduced
I'd like to find a woman that wouldn't mind seducing me
