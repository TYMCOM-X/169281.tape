Subject: NODE 7004 UPGRADE 

GENTLEMEN,

    I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THE TYMCOM-X GROUP STILL DOES THE
PDP-10 BASE CODE GENERATION. THERE IS A PROJECT #47582 TO REMOVE A 9.6
HARDWIRE AND INSTALL A MEMORY SHUFFLER LINK FROM NODE 4261 TO EBUS
NODE 7004. THE PROJECT LISTS THE BOUND FILE IN THE TYM5 DIRECTORY IS TO
BE LOADED INTO 7004 BUT I NOTICED THE NW7004.BND FILE IS ONLY 63 PAGES
LONG AS COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL 69 PAGES FOR EBUS NODES. I WOULD APPRECIATE
YOUR RESPONSE ON THIS WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE. THE PROJECT IS TENTATIVELY
SCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15TH AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE SURE
THE CODE FOR 7004 IS GOING TO WORK TO BE SURE HOST 31 ISN'T DOWN ANY
LONGER THAN NECESSARY.

    SO TO SUMMARIZE, NODE 7004 NEEDS THE CODE TO LOOK FOR MS LINKS FROM
SWITCHERS ND4261 AND ND5405. THE HOST INTERFACE SLOT SHOULD NOT
NEED TO BE CHANGED BUT I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT TO DECIDE HOW

THE CODE SHOULD BE SET UP.

THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR COOPERATION
LUCIEN FRANSCINI (ONTYME FSC.L/FRANSCINI)

Makoto,

I think we have solved your problem. We have added Remote License (RL)
to TOKPRINT. We need you to try SPOOL again. If you still have a problem
we would like to watch the procedures you take to run Spool. In order to
do this, we want to set up a time where Carl Baltrunas and yourself (or
whom the party will be) when you/they tries Spool. Carl is available today.

Please send us an ontyme if you still can not run Spool. We will check our
ontymes frequently this evening.

I am hoping that by adding RL license solved our problems, but if it did
not, we are standing by to help you.

Best regards,
Jan

I have noticed that nightly BACKUPs are not being done on system 32.

This system should be treated as any other TYMCOM-10 - BACKUPs and
ALL-FILES will be done as scheduled.


This system also needs to be rebuilt.  BPA0 and BPC0 are UNREADABLE.
Which shift would like to tackle this for practice in rebuilding 
a TYMCOM-10?

Let Mike BELLOPATRICK know, who in turn will let me know.  If you

Subject: DSKCLN cannot handle more than 3 million pages in DSKB: 

DSKCLN has to keep 3 copies of the SATs in memory while it is running.
One SAT read from disk, one SAT being built, and one SAT of trouble pages.
The one from disk is used in FAST mode and the trouble SAT is where
multiply used pages are marked.  DSKCLN can only use 256K of memory.  Since
the program is 16K, that leaves 240K for data.  The maximum size of a single
SAT is 80K.  This means 80*1024*36 = 3047424 pages.  F33 is using 12.5 3652
spindles (25 logical units) with a total of 2995200 pages.  DSKCLN cannot
handle the 26th unit - F33 is maxed out!

I had to remove unit DSKB31 and remove the pointers to that unit from the RIBs
of HOME.SYS, SAT.SYS, and SPAGES.SYS before DSKCLN could run.

number of units are:

Memorex 3675 (200 Mb/spindle) = 39 units.
Memorex 3650 (300 Mb/spindle) = 25 units.
Memorex 3652 (600 Mb/spindle) = 12.5 drives = 25 logical units.

F33 is currently using only the BPA5 half of BPA5/BPC5; the BPC5 half is
marked as SPARE and is not part of DSKB.

Subject: Dallas had problems with SPOOL; needed SPFIX. 

I ran (DANIELSR)SPFIX on all the Dallas systems; most of them had the
off-by-one bug.  Is there any good reason why we should not put SPFIX
in (UTIL) under the name SPLFIX?  With support going away, Operations
should be left with the tools to fix it themselves.   /Joe

Your help in this matter is greatly appreciated by all concerned. I

Jan san,  
     
Now we have some strange problem on F74.
     
1. A PCOM issuing under username MFOOD, GAN and UUN is (35406,365745), does
   not work well. After issuing the PCOM command, system reply nothing.    
   No prompt returns. In ordinally case, PCOM indicates generated frame    
   information.
   And we also know 
        - The PCOM under this username worked without the problem one week 
          before.   
        - The PCOM issuing other username works without the problem at
          this moment.   
   week before.
     
     
2. When we make GFD MFOOD with other username, we find strange indication  
   on WHO or SYSTAT command. The system indicates just GAN and UUN instead 
   of indication username MFOOD. We have never seen such kind of indication
   ever.  
   This indication appeares only for MFOOD, and did not appeared yesterday.
   For example,
     
   -WHO   
   11* OGURA(35406,365745)         ..... Current Indication 
     
   -WHO   
   11* OGURA(MFOOD)                ..... Ordinal Indication 
     
     
   I don't know this is related the PCOM's problem.    
     
     
Mr. Watanabe, one of my guys, send report on this status through Batch Request, 
PPR#74503, on F74 this morning.    
And I guess something regarding username MFOOD might be changed last night.
     
So, please check and advise about the problem.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Makoto,   
     
I've given your PCOM and SYSTAT Command problem to Osman Guven and he 
replied to me that when he performed the WHO or SYSTAT Command, he    
found no errors. It could have been a bug that came and went. As for  
your PCOM problem, Osman would like to see the failing output so that 
he can further investigate your problem. As it is now, he has nothing 
to go by. So please, if you are still having PCOM problems send Osman 
as much information as you can.    
     
If you have any questions, please let us know.    
     
Thank you,
Jan

Jan san,  
     
Thank you for your  arrangement on that matter.   
     
About the matter, we found every thing returned it's normal form in the    
next day (22nd Feb in Japan). The system indicated a normal form which
we expected in WHO and SYSTAT, and PCOM worked without problem on the day. 
     
I have thought someone fixed the problem under your arrangement, however   
I knew from your OnTyme no one changed something regarding the trouble
explicitly with your arrangement.  
     
Maybe, someone , who you didnot know, changed the system at 21st - 22nd.   
     
If possible, I like to know who changed what.
     
Anyway, currently, the problem has gone.
     
Thank you.
Makoto

TO MY DEAR WIFE:

	During the past year, I have tried to make love to you 365 times, I
have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every 10 days.  The 
following is a list of why I did not succeed more often :

1.  WE WILL WAKE THE CHILDREN.........................17 times
2.  IT'S TOO LATE.....................................15 times
3.  I'M TOO TIRED......................................5 times
4.  IT'S TOO EARLY....................................52 times
5.  IT'S TOO HOT......................................15 times
6.  PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP...........................49 times
7.  THE NEIGHBOURS WILL HEAR...........................9 times
8.  BACKACHE...........................................2 times
9.  HEADACHE..........................................26 times
10. SUNBURNT..........................................10 times
11. YOUR MOTHER WILL HEAR US..........................36 times
12. NOT IN THE MOOD...................................21 times
13. YOU WILL WAKE THE BABY............................17 times
14. WATCHING THE LATE SHOW.............................7 times
15. TOO SORE...........................................9 times
16. NEW HAIRDO.........................................6 times
17. THE WRONG TIME IN THE MONTH.......................14 times
18. YOU HAD TO GO TO THE TOILET.......................19 times

	Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not entirely
because 6 times you just layed there, 8 times you reminded me there was a
crack in the ceiling, 4 times you told me to huury up and get it over with,
7 times I had to wake you up to tell you that I had finished and once I was
afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move.


TO MY DEAR HUSBAND :

	I think you have got things a little confused. Here are the reasons
you did not get more than you did :

1.  CAME HOME DRUNK AND TRIED TO FUCK THE CAT..........7 times
2.  DID NOT COME HOME AT ALL..........................29 times
3.  DID NOT COME......................................14 times
4.  CAME TOO SOON.....................................26 times
5.  WENT SOFT BEFORE YOU GOT IN.......................18 times
6.  TOES IN A CRAMP....................................9 times
7.  WORKING TOO LATE..................................51 times
8.  YOU HAD A RASH - PROBABLY FROM A TOILET SEAT......21 times
9.  SOMEBODY KICKED YOU IN THE BALLS, IN A FIGHT.......4 times
10. CAUGHT IT IN YOUR ZIPPER...........................8 times
11. GOT A COLD, YOUR NOSE KEPT RUNNING................14 times
12. BREWERS DROP AND ALCO-LIMP........................95 times
13. YOUR TEA WAS TOO HOT - YOU BURNT YOUR TONGUE.......8 times
14. YOU HAD A SPLINTER IN YOUR FINGER..................4 times
15. LOST THE NOTION AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY...13 times
16. CAME IN YOUR PYJAMAS WHILE READING A DIRTY BOOK....8 times

	Of the times we did get together, the reason I lay still was because
you missed, and were fucking the sheets. It was'nt talking about the crack in
the ceiling, what I sais was "would you prefer me on my back, or kneeling". The
times you felt me move was because you farted, and I was trying to breathe.
However, six months ago, I phoned the A.A. for help, and their rep. has been
calling on me most afternoons.

The local Kiwanis Club was meeting on Wednesday night, and the guest speaker
was to be a Sex Therapist speaking about Sexual Intimacy in Marriage.
Unfortunately, the speaker got snow-bound at a distant airport, and the local
Kiwanis leader asked a member who was a physician if he would fill in by
speaking on the same topic, which he did.

When the physician got home, his wife asked about the meeting, and he
explained that he had to fill in for the guest speaker.  "What was your speech
about?", she asked.  A bit embarrassed to admit the truth, he replied, "I
spoke on Sailing."

The next morning, the physician's wife was at the grocery store when she met
the wife of one of the other Kiwanis members who said, "My husband tells me
that your husband gave a wonderful and helpful speech last night!"
Thinking about what her husband had told her about his speech, the
physician's wife replied, "You know, it's funny, but I never thought of him as
an expert.  He's only done it twice.  The first time, his hat blew off, and
the second time he threw up and swore he would never do it again!"

>

This is a common question among newcomers to nudist activities.  In
practice, it is nothing to worry about.  What usually happens is
something like this:  You get an erection, somebody notices, points at
you and yells, "Hey, look at the hard-on on that guy" or, "Look at that
guy trying to hide his hard-on". Then everyone gathers around, pointing
and laughing.  If you try to run away, they all follow you.  People
start taking pictures.  Eventually, some mesomorph/homophobe thinks he
catches you looking at his girlfriend/self and beats the hell out of
you.  After this happens two or three times, you get conditioned to
always go limp when you see a naked body.

No problem.

OSMAN,


WONDER IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO ME WHETHER THE NEW MONITOR ON D23 (MON. E)
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LOSS OF TWO AVAILABLE PAGES?  I'VE NOTICED THAT
INSTEAD OF THERE BEING 4096 AVAILABLE PAGES, THERE ARE BUT 4094.  NOT
THAT THIS IS EARTH SHATTERING BUT IT HAS ME CURIOUS.

MANY THANKS.

These are some additional duties I have been trained to do on the TYMCOM-10's
by Software Support:

     SPOOL
     -----

     Fixing "CANNOT FIND FD" errors

     Duplication of requests

     Running MONTHLY SPOOL maintenance software


     MISSING OR INCONSISTENT PACK SET ID's
     -------------------------------------

     Occurs when a host goes down when one or more unit(s)
                                                                Page  2

     is/are off-line.

     Occurs when using DM 30:1 if one or more unit(s)
     are not on-line when taking the system down.


     ASH (Absolute Structure Hash)
     ---

     To track page errors that may occur asynchronously (unexpected
     or unpredictable) to the buffer/record reading loop.

          
          This program causes THUNGS to incremnt and BP's to report
          being HUNG.

     Purpose:  To determine if unit is BAD (needs replaced) or if
               ZFORMATTING will clear up unit(s).


     NOTE:  When this software is running, it puts a heavy load
            on the system.

Subject: F74 has reached limit on number of user names. 

Carl: Anything new on solving Validation's problems yet?

Osman+Craig: Vida Stafford and Julian Min have been having problems adding
new users to F74.  The hash algorithm for both the LUD and the DUL state
that overflow blocks are to be allocated when a block fills up.  It appears
that only system 74 has enough users that blocks are full.  Carl and I have
identified one problem in the LUD that caused programs such as (SYS)LETTER
and (CUD10)USERS to go into an infinite loop when an overflow pointer was
encountered.  This was a case in which programs that create new users in
the LUD and locate users in the LUD worked right, it was programs that
read the entire LUD were broken.

Now the problem is in the DUL.  It looks like ALL of the programs that
write to the DUL are broken.  Only recently have there been enough user names
on a single system to exercise this bug.

In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 31 Mar 89 7:24:58 PST

The CRON program reads (SYS)CRON.CTL and executes particular programs at
specified times.  In some cases, it is more reliable than SUBMIT/XEXEC when
it comes to logging in programs that run at system startup.

It is named after the cron program on Unix.  When you get your Sun manuals,
look up cron in section 8 and crontab in section 5.  It's worth knowing about.

It crashed with a page fault in the middle of the page fault handler.
It could be a software problem - the information stored in the crash
dump is ambiguous.  Even if it is a hardware problem, I doubt very much
that an FE would find anything wrong.  Especially since the system has been
up for almost 24 hours.   /Joe
