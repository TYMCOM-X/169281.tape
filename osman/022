Description of Techalert      :






    I have developed a software tool for troubleshooting X.25 problems
in a lab environment.  Below is the documentation for the implementation
and use of this tool.  The documentation will be updated and maintained
on (techref:38)xhost.doc.




                                                 September 15, 1989

     The XHOST, pronounced x-host or zost (as in host), is a pro-
gram that was developed for testing X.25 without the need for
an X.25 host and without the limitation of a loopback configuration.
The XHOST is an excellent lab tool for the communication specialist
to test various problems, new tymfile configurations, or perhaps a
patch.  It can also be used to lab test a gen for a new installation.

     The XHOST is a program that can be genned and loaded into a slot.  
This program emulates the functions of an X.25 host.  The XHOST
slot requires approximately 30k of memory and one SIO M.REF.  
The source program for the XHOST resides on both the PDP-10 and 
Sun systems.

     In addition to the hardware mentioned above, a crossover cable
is also required to attach the XHOST slot hardware to the X.25 dce
slot.  Clocking for the link can be provided by the daughter
card.  A valid host number is required for the XHOST.  The slot
code for the XHOST is genned using NAD and loaded into the slot
with LOADII (or BITS) like any other slot.
     
     A sample tymfile and command file are available to copy
and use to gen a XHOST slot.  The XHOST slot can be logged into
remotely through the network, much like the XOM for an X.25 slot.

     The XHOST is usually trouble free.  Many problems encountered
while in use can be corrected by entering a ^Z to clear a hung 
condition.  If that does not clear the problem, halting and
re-enabling the slot, or reloading the slot can correct most

problems.

     Any questions or comments about this document or the XHOST and
its use should be directed to Ken Stone at 408-922-8157, or ontyme
nsc.k/stone.





     To gen the XHOST, copy the tymfile (techserv:25,33,54)xhost1.t01 into
your directory, and edit it.  The following changes must be made. Change
the OPTION(HOST....) to your lab XHOST host number.  Also change the
CLDADR and CLGADR statements as defined below.  Copy the file
(techserv:25,33,54)xhost1.c01 into your directory and edit it to
include your new tymfile.  Below is a sample of the tymfile, marking where
some changes need to be made.

     After the XHOST and the X.25 slots are loaded, the XHOST will report
answered.  The communication specialist can then log into the XHOST slot
and get the first menu screen of the XHOST.  Through the menu one can
control frames, packets and functions of the host and its link.

There is also a status command, a status line and a new information screen.
Below is a sample logon into the XHOST.  The main menu will appear as below.

                                 VERSION 1.01


               XHOST COMMANDS:
               -------------------
              ^A - ANNOUNCEMENTS NEW FEATURES
              ^X - LINK CONTROL COMMANDS
              ^F - FRAME CREATION
              ^P - PACKET CREATION
              ^D - TOGGLE RESPONSE TO CALL REQUEST
              ^K - CURRENT HOST STATUS
              ^L - SEND OUT CANNED HOST CALL
              ^V - CLEAR CALL MOST RECENT CHANNEL
              ^Z - LOGOFF
[>


     The user can now follow the menus of the XHOST, entering
control characters and information as prompted for by the XHOST.

     The XHOST can build frames and packets from the ground up and
send them out over the link to the X.25 slot.  Some common frames and
packets have been abbreviated into one function on the XHOST.  Instead
of building a SABM frame, UA and restart packet, this entire function
could be handled under ^X - LINK CONTROL COMMANDS.

     The XHOST also automatically processes all incoming X.25 data.
Once the link is established and the X.25 slot is answered, the
XHOST will accept any call request, and properly acknowledge the
frame and packet layer traffic.



     Here is an overview of functions available from the main menu.

              ^A - ANNOUNCEMENTS NEW FEATURES
    
     Each time the source code changes for the XHOST, there might
be some additional information located here as to a new feature,
a fix, or perhaps some new documentation.  The XHOST revision can
be seen on the main menu, or through ?vern in the slot.

              ^X - LINK CONTROL COMMANDS

     The XHOST can bring the X.25 link up and down, or freeze the
link and respond to no more data, as if the line went out.

              ^F - FRAME CREATION

     At any time the XHOST can send a frame down the link to
the X.25.  The tech logged into the XHOST will have to enter
the frame and address and all applicable hex control bytes.

              ^P - PACKET CREATION

     This is the same function as frame creation, except frame
information is already canned into the packet.  Packet building
is much simplier because of quick user-friendly prompts from
the XHOST.

              ^D - TOGGLE RESPONSE TO CALL REQUEST

     The XHOST will perform as usual, except that call request
packets sent from the X.25 slot to the XHOST will be ignored.
Entering another ^D will change this option back.  The status line
will let the user know which state has just been entered.

              ^K - CURRENT HOST STATUS

     On most screens a ^K will perform much the same function
as ?HOST when logged into an X.25 slot.  ^K will show the
number of users and status of the link.

              ^L - SEND OUT CANNED HOST CALL

     The XHOST tymfile has the called and calling addresses of
the most frequently used outbound call into the network from the
XHOST.  The is a convenient timesaver.

              ^V - CLEAR CALL MOST RECENT CHANNEL

     The XHOST will transmit a clear request to the X.25 host on the
last channel in use, with a cause of zero, diagnostic zero.

              ^Z - LOGOFF

     The tech can log off of the XHOST.  On many menu screens the
^Z will drop the user back to the previous menu.





     Here is a sample session using the XHOST to bring up a link,
and place a call into the network.

     The prompts received from the XHOST will be displayed below
in upper case.  I have added comments in lower case.

     Any input typed into the XHOST must be entered in upper case.

    Below one can see that the user must respond to each prompt
from the XHOST that is followed by -->

     INPUT YOUR PACKET TO BE SENT.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION
     HAS BEEN PREASSIGNED FOR YOU: PRIMARY/SECONDARY 01 OR 03

     Next I enter a call request packet.  It was sent from the
XHOST to the X.25 slot.  The slot build an X250 username that
was rejected by the SUP because of validations.  A message is
returned to status line, when the clear request is received by the
XHOST.
