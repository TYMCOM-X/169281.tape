	VARIAN BASE NODES FROM THE PUBLIC NETWORK BUT STILL 
	ALLOW THE HOST PDP-10 COMPUTERS TO ACCESS THE NETWORK
	USING MINI ENGINES.

	IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT AT LEAST 2 PERSONS ARE ON SITE
	FOR THE E-BUS CONVERSION. THIS WILL MAKE THE CONVERSION
	EASIER AND WILL PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENTS DURING
	REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION.

	THE LOCATION OF THE COMPONENTS FOUND WITHIN A VARIAN
	BASE ARE SHOWN IN THE ENCLOSED DRAWING AND DESCRIBED
	BELOW. THIS SHOULD MAKE THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING
	THE VARIAN BASE EASIER TO FOLLOW. FOR REMOVAL OF THE
	COMPONENTS FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE `PREPARATION
	OF THE VARIAN BASE' SECTION OF THIS DOCUMENT.

		A) I/0 POWER SUPPLY, NOT REMOVED.
		B) I/O POWER SUPPLY, NOT REMOVED.
		C) MAIN CHASSIS POWER SUPPLY, REMOVE.
		D) MAIN CHASSIS/FRONT CONSOLE, REMOVE.
		E) HORIZONTAL PADDLE CARD, REMOVE.
		F) EXPANSION CHASSIS, REMOVE.
		G) CARD CAGE, NOT REMOVED.
		H) CONNECTOR PANEL, REMOVE.
		I) INTERFACE PANEL, NOT REMOVED.
		J) BLOWER, NOT REMOVED.

	THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE MINI 
	ENGINE CABINET AND MOUNTED IN THE VARIAN CABINET FOR THE 
	E-BUS CONVERSION. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE 
	`INSTALLATION OF THE E-BUS UPGRADE KIT' SECTION OF THIS
	DOCUMENT.

		K) MINI ENGINE POWER SUPPLY.
		L) FRONT CONSOLE.
		M) MINI ENGINE CHASSIS.
		N) SIO CARD CAGE.
		O) CONNECTOR PANEL.

		 INSTALLATION OF THE E-BUS UPGRADE KIT
		---------------------------------------

	1) PRE-ASSEMBLE THE MOUNTING BRACKETS AND INSTALL 1 SET IN THE
	   VARIAN CABINET UNDER THE EXISTING I/O POWER SUPPLIES. LEAVE
	   ENOUGH ROOM TO MOUNT THE MINI ENGINE POWER SUPPLY AND HAVE
	   A FEW EXTRA INCHES OF SPACE FOR VENTILATION.

	2) REMOVE THE POWER SUPPLY FROM THE MINI ENGINE AS FOLLOWS:

		- DISCONNECT THE A.C. POWER CORD.
		- DISCONNECT THE POWER CABLE AT THE J1 CONNECTOR.
		- REMOVE THE GROUND STRAP AND ANY POWER CORDS
		  CONNECTED TO THE POWER SUPPLY.
		- REMOVE THE P.S. MOUNTING SCREWS AND SAVE THEM.
		- REMOVE THE POWER SUPPLY.

	3) MOUNT THE MINI ENGINE POWER SUPPLY IN THE VARIAN AS FOLLOWS:

		- INSTALL THE POWER SUPPLY FROM THE REAR OF THE VARIAN
		  CABINET AND PLACE IT ON THE MOUNTING RAILS.
		- INSURE THAT THE J1 CONNECTOR IS FACING THE FRONT OF
		  THE CABINET. 		
		- USE THE MOUNTING SCREWS YOU REMOVED FROM THE MINI
		  AND SECURE THE POWER SUPPLY TO THE VARIAN CABINET.

	4) INSTALL THE SECOND SET OF MOUNTING RAILS ABOVE THE VARIAN
	   CARD CAGE AND BELOW THE MINI ENGINE POWER SUPPLY. LEAVE
           ENOUGH ROOM TO MOUNT A FRONT CONSOLE BELOW THE MINI ENGINE
	   POWER SUPPLY AND A MINI CHASSIS BELOW THE FRONT CONSOLE.	

	5) MOUNT THE SPRING LATCH CLIPS FOR THE FRONT CONSOLE BELOW
	   THE MINI ENGINE POWER SUPPLY IN THE FRONT OF THE VARIAN
	   CABINET.

	6) REMOVE MINI ENGINE CHASSIS AS FOLLOWS:

	7) INSTALL THE MINI ENGINE CHASSIS IN THE VARIAN CABINET
	   AS FOLLOWS:

		- INSTALL FROM THE FRONT OF THE VARIAN CABINET AND
		  PLACE ON THE MOUNTING RAILS.
		- SECURE THE CHASSIS TO THE CABINET WITH THE SCREWS
		  YOU REMOVED FROM THE MINI ENGINE.

		  SUPPLY TO THE CHASSIS.
		- CONNECT THE POWER CONNECTOR FROM THE CHASSIS TO THE 
		  J1 CONNECTOR ON THE POWER SUPPLY.

	8) MOUNT THE FRONT CONSOLE ON THE LATCH SPRING CLIPS AND THEN
	   CONNECT THE FRONT CONSOLE TO THE ROM & I/O AND CHASSIS.

	9) INSTALL THE E-BUS CARD AS FOLLOWS:
		- SWITCH SETTINGS FOR THE SWITCH AT LOCATION A3 ARE 1
		  OFF, 2 - 8 ON.
		- SWITCH SETTINGS FOR THE SWITCH AT LOCATION C3 ARE
		  1 AND 5 OFF, THE REST ON.
		- THE E-BUS BOARD SHOULD BE INSTALLED IN SLOT 1 OR 0
		  OF THE MINI CHASSIS. IF AN SIO MOTHER IS TO BE
		  INSTALLED THE SIO BOARD WILL GO IN SLOT 1 AND THE 
		  E-BUS WILL GO IN SLOT 0. 
		- THE SLOT SHOULD BE SET UP FOR A DMA DEVICE BY REMOVING
		  JUMPERS 122 - 222 AND 137 - 237. INSURE THAT JUMPERS
		  ARE INSTALLED BETWEEN 127 - 227, 128 - 228, AND 134 -
		  234.

	10) THE E-BUS CARD CONNECTS TO THE INTERFACE PANEL ON THE VARIAN
	   AS FOLLOWS:

		- SWING OPEN THE INTERFACE PANEL. 
		- SOME VARIANS WILL HAVE 2 INTERFACE PANEL BOARDS. TO
		  FIND THE ACTIVE PANEL CHECK LOCATION 8H. PIN 4 IS JUMPERED 
		  TO PIN 16 OR THIS LOCATION IS MARKED AS ADDRESS 34 FOR THE
		  ACTIVE BOARD.
		- REMOVE THE EXISTING CABLES AT LOCATIONS X7 AND X8 ON THE
		  INTERFACE PANEL BOARD.
		- CONNECT 1 E BUS CABLE TO P4 ON THE E BUS CARD, RUN THE
		  CABLE THROUGH THE HOLE PROVIDED FOR CABLES IN THE
		  INTERFACE PANEL, AND CONNECT TO X8 ON THE INTERFACE 
		  PANEL BOARD.
		- CONNECT THE OTHER E-BUS CABLE TO P1, RUN THROUGH THE 
		  INTERFACE PANEL, AND CONNECT TO X7 ON THE INTERFACE
		  PANEL BOARD.

	11) IF AN SIO MOTHER BOARD WILL BE USED WITH THE MINI ENGINE
	    PERFORM THE FOLLOWING:

		- MOUNT THE SIO CARD CAGE IN THE REAR OF THE VARIAN
		  CABINET, UNDER THE MINI CHASSIS.
		- MAKE THE SIO MOTHER TO DAUGHTER BOARD CONNECTIONS.

	12) MOUNT THE CONNECTOR PANEL FOR THE MINI ENGINE AS FOLLOWS:

		- CONNECT 6 STANDOFF HEX ADAPTERS TO THE FRONT OF THE
		  CONNECTOR PANEL. THIS WILL RECESS THE CONNECTOR PANEL
		  INTO THE VARIAN CABINET.
		- IF A SIO CARD CAGE IS INSTALLED MOUNT THE CONNECTOR
		  PANEL UNDER THE CARD CAGE. IF NOT MOUNT THE CONNECTOR 
		  PANEL UNDER THE MINI CHASSIS.
		- MAKE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE SYNC BOARD AND THE
		  CONNECTOR PANELS.  


	13) APPLY POWER TO THE MINI AND VARIAN POWER SUPPLIES, THEN
	    LOAD AND RUN DIAGNOSTICS. AFTER PASSING THE DIAGS LOAD	
	    THE MINI WITH NODE CODE. AT THIS TIME A DIAGNOSTIC FOR
	    THE E-BUS BOARD IS NOT AVAILABLE. THE FOLLOWING SECTION
	    WILL DESCRIBE TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES FOR THE E-BUS.




		E-BUS TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
		---------------------------

	WHEN THE E-BUS BOARD IS INSTALLED IN A NODE THAT IS
	RUNNING CODE THE GREEN LED ON THE FRONT OF THE BOARD
	SHOULD BE ILLUMINATED. 
	
	IF THE RED LED IS ILLUMINATED THE BOARD IS IN RESET
	AND WILL NOT OPERATE UNTILL THE E-BUS CODE IS LOADED.

	FOR ANY E-BUS PROBLEM BEGIN BY LOGGING INTO DDT AND 
	CHECK THE STATUS OF THE E-BUS SLOT. IF THE SLOT IS NOT
	LOADED YOU WILL HAVE TO LOAD. IF THE SLOT IS DOWN
	PERFORM THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES.

	1) CONNECT A TERMINAL TO THE TTY PORT ON THE E-BUS BOARD.
	   THE TERMINAL TTY PORT IS THE RIGHTMOST PORT ON THE 
	   BOARD. THE SPEED OF THIS PORT IS SELECTED BY THE 
	   SWITCH AT LOCATION 3A. POSITIONS 1 AND 2 SELECT THE 
	   SPEED.
			1  2 
			-  -
			0  0 = 300
			0  1 = 1200
			1  0 = 4800

	   ENTER XPIBUG BY PRESSING THE RIGHTMOST (ABORT) BUTTON
	   ON THE E-BUS BOARD. 


	2) ENTER:  MD 900		

	3) XPIBUG WILL DISPLAY 16 BYTES STARTING AT LOCATION 900.
	   THE 4 BYTE WORD AT 900 IS THE PERMANENT MESSAGE AREA
	   FOR ISIS-to-IPI MESSAGES. THE 4 BYTES AT 904 ARE THE
	   PERMANENT MESSAGE AREA FOR IPI-to-ISIS MESSAGES.

	   FROM THE XPI POINT OF VIEW ENGINE ADDRESSES BEGIN AT
	   E00000. THE ADDRESSES AT 900 AND 904 WILL BE SOMETHING
	   SIMILAR TO 00E02560 AND 00E02568, RESPECTIVLY.

	4) NOW ENTER: MD E02560 (THE ADDRESS YOU USE WILL PROBABLY
	   BE DIFFERENT)

	5) XPIBUG WILL DISPLAY 16 BYTES FROM THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED.
	   THE FIRST BYTE DISPLAYED IS A MESSAGE BYTE FROM ISIS. A
	   CRASH MESSAGE FROM ISIS IS 13. A CRASH MESSAGE FROM THE 
	   ISIS SLOT INTERFACE TO THE E-BUS BOARD IS 03.

	   THE IPI-to-ISIS MESSAGE WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THESE 16 
	   BYTES ALSO. THE 11TH AND 12TH BYTES ARE IPI MESSAGE BYTES.
	   IF THE 12TH BYTE IS 03 THEN THE E-BUS HAS SENT A CRASH
	   MESSAGE TO ISIS. THE 11TH BYTE IS THE CRASH TYPE. CRASH 
	   TYPES ARE:

		50 = UNKNOWN OR ILLEGAL MESSAGE FROM ISIS
		08 = PDP10 INTERFACE TIME-OUT
		09 = PDP10 INTERFACE PARITY ERROR
		0A = PDP10 INTERFACE DDOES NOT RESPOND

	6) A CRASH BY THE PDP10 WILL NOT STOP THE E-BUS SOFTWARE
	   FROM RUNNING AND IS NOT A CONCERN OF ISIS SO PDP10
	   CRASHES ARE NOT INDICATED IN THIS MESSAGE AREA TO ISIS.

	7) PRINT OR COPY THIS DATA REGARDING ISIS AND IPI MESSAGES
	   FOR USE BY NTD PERSONNEL RESPONSIBLE FOR ISIS/E-BUS
	   SOFTWARE.

	8) IF THE ISIS MESSAGE CODE WAS 03 YOU COULD OBTAIN MORE
	   DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRASH THROUGH DDT.

	9) IF THE ISIS MESSAGE WAS 13 THE NODE WILL HAVE TO BE 
	   RELOADED. OTHERWISE A RELOAD ON THE SLOT SHOULD GET 
	   THE E-BUS RUNNING AGAIN.

	THERE IS ALSO THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SLOT WILL BE UP BUT
	THE HOST STILL WON'T COME UP. THIS COULD BE DUE TO THE E-BUS
	SOFTWARE CONTAINED ON THE BOARD. PULL THE ISIS-to-IPI MESSAGES
	AS LISTED ABOVE AND PERFORM THE FOLLOWING.

	1) LOG INTO DDT AND PULL THE IRING AND ORING FOR THE E-BUS
	   SLOT. INSURE THAT THE DATA IS PULLED ON HARDCOPY AND THE 
           NFMI AND CEI ARE INCLUDED.		   
	   
	2) RELOAD THE NODE, TRY BRINGING UP THE HOST, THEN CONTACT
	   NTS.
