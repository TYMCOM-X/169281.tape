This is in response to a request that I received immediately
after creation of the group and a posting regarding the name
of the system.

The request was that I repost the basic "isis release" blurb
for anyone who might be interested in subscribing to this newsgroup
but unaware of just what the ISIS toolkit does.  The blurb follows.

With regard to the name ISIS, our group has existed as an academic
project funded by DARPA for about 6 years now, during which we have
published extensively on a system called the "ISIS Toolkit".
We named the project (which is concerned with fault-tolerance)
after the Egyptian Goddess Isis, who brought Osiris back to
life after he was torn apart by Seth in an epic battle.  The ISIS
Toolkit doesn't go quite as far, but it can be a pretty powerful
facility nonetheless.

This newgroup was established because we now have quite a few
users, 200 at last count, and this has created pressure for a forum
within which suggestions, bug fixes, user-developed software, etc.
could be exchanged.  The group was created after the usual discussion
period and vote in news.groups.

It is true that INTEL has an operating system by the same name,
and presumably a trademark on the ISIS name.  However, we know
of no trademark on the "ISIS Toolkit", and in any case ISIS is
not a commercial product -- the source is in the public domain.
INTEL has never asked us to cease using the name, and we think
it is fairly clear that our system has nothing to do with the
INTEL ISIS OS.  Hopefully, INTEL won't decide to take action now!
At any rate, we make a real effort not to use the name ISIS in a
way that might confuse people.

--- standard isis blurb ---

This is to announce the availability of a public distribution  of
the  ISIS  System,  a  toolkit for distributed and fault-tolerant
programming.  The initial version of ISIS runs on  UNIX  on  SUN,
DEC,  GOULD,  and  HP  systems, although ports to other UNIX-like
systems are planned for the future.  No kernel changes are needed
to support ISIS; you just roll it in and should be able to use it
immediately.  The current implementation of ISIS performs well in
networks of up to about 100-200 sites.


--- Who might find ISIS useful? ---

You will find ISIS useful if you  are  interested  in  developing
relatively sophisticated distributed programs under UNIX (eventu-
ally, other systems too).  These include programs that distribute
computations over multiple processes, need fault-tolerance, coor-
dinate activities  underway  at  several  places  in  a  network,
recover  automatically from software and hardware crashes, and/or
dynamically reconfigure while maintaining some  sort  of  distri-
buted  correctness  constraint at all times.  ISIS is also useful
in building certain types of distributed real time systems.

Here are examples of problems to which ISIS has been applied:

   o On the factory floor, we  are  working  with  an  industrial
     research  group  that is using ISIS to program decentralized
     cell controllers.  They need to arrive at a modular, expand-
     able, fault-tolerant distributed system.  ISIS makes it pos-
     sible for them to build such a system without a huge invest-
     ment  of  effort.  (The ISIS group also working closely with
     an automation standards consortium called  ANSA,  headed  by
     Andrew Herbert in Cambridge).

   o As part of a network file system, we built an  interface  to
     the  UNIX  NFS (we call ours the "RNFS") that supports tran-
     sparent file  replication  and  fault-tolerance.   The  RNFS
     speaks NFS protocols but employs ISIS internally to maintain
     a consistent distributed state.  For  most  operations,  the
     RNFS  performance is at worst 50-75% of that of a normal NFS
     -- despite supporting file replication and fault-tolerance.

   o A parallel "make" program.  Here, ISIS  was  used  within  a
     control  program that splits up large software recompilation
     tasks  and  runs  them  on  idle  workstations,   tolerating
     failures  and  dynamically  adapting  if  a  workstation  is
     reclaimed by its owner.

   o In a hospital, we have looked at using ISIS to manage repli-
     cated data and to coordinate activities that may span multi-
     ple machines.  The problem here is  the  need  for  absolute
     correctness:  if a doctor is to trust a network to carry out
     orders that might impact on patient health, there is no room
     for  errors due to race conditions or failures.  At the same
     time, cost considerations argue for distributed systems that
     can  be  expanded  slowly  in  a fully decentralized manner.
     ISIS addresses both of these issues: it makes it far  easier
     to  build  a reliable, correct, distributed system that will
     manage  replicated  data  and  provide  complex  distributed
     behaviors.  And, ISIS is designed to scale well.

   o For programming numerical algorithms.  One group at  Cornell
     used  ISIS  to  distribute  matrix  computations  over large
     numbers of workstations.  They did this because the worksta-
     tions were available, mostly idle, and added up to a tremen-
     dous computational engine.

   o In a particle physics experiment.  We  are  talking  to  one
     group that hopes to use ISIS to implement a distributed con-
     trol program.  It will operate data collection devices, farm
     out  the  particle  track  calculations  onto lightly loaded
     workstations, collect the results,  and  adapt  to  failures
     automatically  by reconfiguring and shifting any interrupted
     computation to an operational machine.

The problems above are characterized by several features.  First,
they  would all be very difficult to solve using remote procedure
calls or transactions against some shared  database.   They  have
complex,  distributed  correctness constraints on them: what hap-
pens at site "a" often requires a coordinated action at site  "b"
to  be  correct.   And,  they do a lot of work in the application
program itself, so that the ISIS communication mechanism  is  not
the bottleneck.

If you have an application like this, or are interested in taking
on  this  kind  of  application,  ISIS  may be a big win for you.
Instead of investing resources in building an environment  within
which  to  solve  your application, using ISIS means that you can
tackle the application immediately,  and  get  something  working
much faster than if you start with RPC (remote procedure calls).


--- What ISIS does ---

The ISIS system has been under development for several  years  at
Cornell  University.   After  an  initial  focus on transactional
"resilient objects", the emphasis shifted in 1986  to  a  toolkit
style  of  programming.   This approach stresses distributed con-
sistency in applications that  manage  replicated  data  or  that
require  distributed  actions  to  be taken in response to events
occurring in the system.  An "event" could be a user request on a
distributed service, a change to the system configuration result-
ing from a process or site failure or recovery, a timeout, etc.

The ISIS toolkit uses a subroutine call style  interface  similar
to  the interface to any conventional operating system.  The pri-
mary difference, however, is  that  ISIS  functions  as  a  meta-
operating  system.   ISIS system calls result in actions that may
span multiple processes and machines in the  network.   Moreover,
ISIS  provides  a  novel  "virtual  consistency"  property to its
users.  This property makes it easy to build  software  in  which
currently  executing processes behave in a coordinated way, main-
tain replicated data, or otherwise satisfy a system-wide correct-
ness  property.   Moreover,  virtual synchrony makes even complex
operations look atomic,  which  generally  implies  that  toolkit
functions  will  not  interfere  with  one another.  One can take
advantage of this to develop distributed ISIS software in a  sim-
ple  step-by-step style, starting with a non-distributed program,
then adding  replicated  data  or  backup  processes  for  fault-
tolerance  or higher availability, then extending the distributed
solution to support dynamic reconfiguration, etc.  ISIS  provides
a  really  unique style of distributed programming -- at least if
your distributed computing problems run up against the issues  we
address.   For  such  applications, the ISIS programming style is
both easy and intuitive.

ISIS is really intended for, and is good at, problems  that  draw
heavily  on  replication of data and coordination of actions by a
set of processes that know about one  another's  existence.   For
example,  in  a factory, one might need to coordinate the actions
of a set of machine-controlled drills at  a  manufacturing  cell.
Each  drill  would  do  its  part of the overall work to be done,
using a coordinated  scheduling  policy  that  avoids  collisions
between  the  drill heads, and with fault-tolerance mechanisms to
deal with bits breaking.  ISIS is ideally suited to solving prob-
lems  like  this  one.  Similar problems arise in any distributed
setting, be it local-area network software for the  office  or  a
CAD  problem,  or  the  automation of a critical care system in a
hospital.

ISIS is not intended for transactional database applications.  If
this  is  what  you  need, you should obtain one of the many such
systems that are now available.  On the other hand, ISIS would be
useful  if  your  goal  is to build a front-end in a setting that
needs databases.  The point is that  most  database  systems  are
designed  to  avoid interference between simultaneously executing
processes.  If your application also  needs  cooperation  between
processes  doing  things  concurrently at several places, you may
find this aspect hard to solve  using  just  a  database  because
databases  force  the  interactions to be done indirectly through
the shared data.  ISIS is good for solving this kind of  problem,
because  it  provides  a direct way to replicate control informa-
tion, coordinate the actions of the front-end processes,  and  to
detect and react to failures.

ISIS itself runs as a user-domain program on  UNIX  systems  sup-
porting  the  TCP/IP protocol suite.  It currently is operational
on SUN, DEC, GOULD and HP versions of UNIX.  A  MACH  version  is
now running at Cornell and will be released later this spring, as
will a FORTRAN-ISIS interface and a port to the APOLLO UNIX.  And,
a LISP-ISIS interface (from Allegro) is now being tested and will
be included into ISIS release V1.2 (planned for May 1989).

The actual set of tools includes the following:

   o High performance mechanisms supporting lightweight tasks  in
     UNIX,  a  simple message-passing facility, and a very simple
     and  uniform  addressing  mechanism.   Users  do  not   work
     directly  with things like ports, sockets, binding, connect-
     ing, etc.  ISIS handles all of this.

   o A process "grouping" facility, which  permits  processes  to
     dynamically  form and leave symbolically-named associations.
     The system serializes changes  to  the  membership  of  each
     group: all members see the same sequence of changes.  Groups
     names can be used as a location-transparent address.

   o A suite of  broadcast  protocols  integrated  with  a  group
     addressing  mechanism.   This  suite  operates in a way that
     makes it look as if all broadcasts are received  "simultane-
     ously"  by  all  the members of a group, and are received in
     the same "view" of group membership.

   o Ways of obtaining distributed executions.   When  a  request
     arrives in a group, or a distributed event takes place, ISIS
     supports any of a variety of execution styles, ranging  from
     a  redundant computation to a coordinator-cohort computation
     in which one process takes the requested actions while  oth-
     ers back it up, taking over if the coordinator fails.

   o Replicated data with 1-copy consistency guarantees.

   o  Synchronization  facilities,  based  on  token  passing  or
     read/write locks.

   o Facilities for watching a for a process or  site  (computer)
     to fail or recover, triggering execution of subroutines pro-
     vided by the user when the  watched-for  event  occurs.   If
     several  members  of  a  group watch for the same event, all
     will see it at the same "time" with respect to arriving mes-
     sages  to  the group and other events, such as group member-
     ship changes.

   o A facility for joining  a  group  and  atomically  obtaining
     copies of any variables or data structures that comprise its
     "state" at the instant before the  join  takes  place.   The
     programmer who designs a group can specify state information
     in addition to the state automatically maintained by ISIS.

   o Automatic restart of applications when a  computer  recovers
     from  a crash, including log-based recovery (if desired) for
     cases when all representatives of a service fail  simultane-
     ously.

   o Ways to build transactions or  to  deal  with  transactional
     files  and  database  systems external to ISIS.  ISIS itself
     doesn't know about files or transactions.

Everything in ISIS is fault-tolerant.  Our programming manual has
been  written  in  a tutorial style, and gives details on each of
these mechanisms.  It includes examples  of  typical  small  ISIS
applications and how they can be solved.  The distribution of the
system includes demos, such as the parallel  make  facility  men-
tioned  above;  this  large  ISIS application program illustrates
many system features.

To summarize, ISIS provides a broad  range  of  tools,  including
some  that  require algorithms that would be very hard to support
in other systems or to implement by hand.  Performance  is  quite
good:  most  tools require between 1/20 and 1/5 second to execute
on a SUN 3/60, although the actual  numbers  depend  on  how  big
processes  groups get, the speed of the network, the locations of
processes involved, etc.  Overall, however, the system is  really
quite fast when compared with, say, file access over the network.
For certain common operations  a  five  to  ten-fold  performance
improvement  is expected within two years, as we implement a col-
lection of optimizations.  The system scales well with  the  size
of  the  network,  and  system overhead is largely independent of
network size.  On a machine that is not participating in any ISIS
application, the overhead of having ISIS running is negligible.


--- You can get a copy of ISIS in the near future ---

A prototype of ISIS is now fully operational and  is  being  made
available  to the public.  The version we plan to distribute con-
sists of a C implementation for UNIX, and has been ported to  the
SUN  UNIX  system, ULTRIX, the Gould UNIX implementation, and HP-
UX.  Performance is uniformly good.  A 225 page tutorial and sys-
tem  manual  containing  numerous  programming  examples  is also
available.

The remainder of this posting focuses on how to get ISIS, and how
to get the manual.  Everything is free except bound copies of the
manual.  Source is included, but the  system  is  in  the  public
domain, and is released on conditiat any ports to other sys-
tems or minor modifications remain in  the  public  domain.   The
manual  is  copyrighted  by the project and is available in hard-
copy form or as a DVI file, with figures available  for  free  on
request.


--- Release schedule ---

 June 1: a BETA release of the system  for  reasonably  sophisti-
     cated  sites  that can deal with software that will probably
     still have some bugs.  The system, as of June  1,  will  not
     scale beyond about 150 sites at one time.

 August 1: a final release of  the  June  1  system  and  a  BETA
     release  of  a  version containing some performance enhance-
     ments and some tools that are missing from the  June-1  Beta
     release  (notably,  an  interface from ISIS to transactional
     systems like CAMELOT).


--- Release strategy ---

We will place a compressed TAR image in a public directory on one
of our machines and permit people to copy it off using FTP.  Also
available will be DVI  format  versions  of  our  manual.   Bound
copies  will  be  available at $10 each.  A package of figures to
glue into the DVI version will be provided free of charge.

A tape containing ISIS will be provided to a  limited  number  of
sites  upon  payment of a charge to cover our costs in making the
tape.  Our resources are limited and we do not wish to do much of
this.


--- Commercial support ---

We are working with a local  company,  ISIS  Distributed  Systems
Inc.,  to  provide  support services for ISIS.  This company will
prepare distributions and work to fix  bugs.   Support  contracts
are  available  for an annual fee; without a contract, we will do
our best to be helpful but make no promises.  Other services that
IDS  plans  to  provide will include consulting on fault-tolerant
distributed systems design, instruction on how to work with ISIS,
bug  identification  and  fixes,  and  contractual joint software
development projects.  The company is also prepared to port  ISIS
to   other  systems  or  other  programming  languages.   Contact
"birman@gvax.cs.cornell.edu" for more information.


--- If you want ISIS, let us know ---

Send mail to schiz@gvax.cs.cornell.edu, subject  "I  want  ISIS",
with electronic and physical mailing details.  We will send you a
form for acknowledging agreement with the conditions for  release
of the software and will later contact you with details on how to
actually copy the system off our machine to yours.


--- You can read more about ISIS if you like ---

ok, ok... so the dates and the protections are wrong... you can't have
everything the first time.  as soon as I find out what format the dates
are stored in and how to map {NO, LK, RUN, RD, AP, UPD, CP, ALL} into
unix <rwx> I'll fix that stuff.  (Isn't that what CHMOD and CHOWN are for?)

/Carl

PS. Joe, Osman:  If you happen to know where the date-time stuff is in the
    documentation, drop me a line, so I can incorporate this stuff soon!

Why didn't you try the obvious?  For 12:29:12 PDT, use 4434344010 octal.
(((((1989-1970)*365+1+1+1+1+1)+(31+28+31+30)+(17-1))*24+(12+7))*60+29)*60+12.
Everything in Unix is based on the number of seconds since 1-Jan-1970 0:00 GMT
which is 31-Dec-1969 16:00 PDT.  (Try "od -c foo.tar" on a file created today)

I typed out MSGLOG on D25; it indicated that the last 2 RCCBAD stopcodes
were preceded by "INFO stopcode BASE, Key=11" both times.  Key = 11 means
the slot crashed when the black box sensed a parity error from the KL's
memory.  Lucien has been informed.  I will be working on P035/E01 which
will make sure that buffered stopcode messages get printed when crashing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The purpose of this memo is to announce the formal handing over of
the Tymnet Suns Code Management Project from Planning Tools Development
(Network Planning) to Network Services organization.
 
Since November 1988, Network Planning has been responsible for
initiating this project and bringing it to an "Operating" State.
Some of the tasks that have been completed include:
 
	o Sizing of the number and location of machines.
	o Tymnet network connection issues.
	o Sun System Networking problems.
	o Tymfile directory structures.
	o Network code directory structures.
	o Code generation tools directory structures.
	o Distribution of disks among the Fremont and Malvern sites.
	o Distribution of home directories on the Sun machines.
	o Checking consistency with current Tymfile backup procedures.
	o System Administration tasks and Organizational Structure.
	o Initial install and bring up of the Sun machines.
	o X.25 install and bring up.
	o Code gen testing and node loading (alpha test).
 
Krish Narayan has been involved in this project since November 1988,
as the Project Leader of this project. We are happy to report the
                                                                Page  2

following status on this project:
 
	o Preliminary Version of "Procedures and Guidelines" written,
	  which includes several recommendations for Operating the
	  Suns.
	o Install of SunOS 4.0.1 completed successfully.
	o Install of YP completed and successful.
	o Tymfile and Network code directory structures in place.
	o X.25 installed and tested out successfully, both in the Sun
	  side and Engine side, with full V.35 connectivity.
	o Nad and bits tested out and verified for workability.
	o Network code brought over from System 33 and installed into
	  the correct structure on the Suns by Network Services.
	o PIRs issued for new versions of Nad, Bits, cpp etc.  for the
	  Sun 4 processor.
 
This project is now in "Operation" and with no major open issues.
This completes Network Planning's role in the migration process for
code generation and associated tools. As of June 1, Network Resources
is supporting this project.  Krish will continue to be available
for consultation to help resolve any unexpected problems, making
sure that the transition is smooth.
 
I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank all of you for the
excellent support you have provided to Krish during this project to make
it a reality. This project has always been a major challenge and we can all
take pride in what we have accomplished.
 
Regards,
 
Jay Parekh.

Problem:  System 38 crashed after getting more bad spots, this time on DSKB0.
          They had tried copying out the pack, but PAKCOP got too many errors.
Paged at 18:30 Fri - This call was to let me know that they were trying to use
          ASP to copy the one pack to tape and restore to a second pack.
Paged at 06:25 Sat - After the one-pack restore from tape, too many user
          directories had been wiped out.  Rick Daniels started a complete
          system rebuild, but it said "Reserved page already allocated" due
          to a bad spot in the middle of SPAGE.SYS.  Told him to use the
          command "TYPE BAT DSKB0" to located the bad spot and "CHANGE BAT"
          to clear it.
Paged at 13:05 Sat - Several read errors on tape 13.  They tried the rebuild
          but got read errors on tape 2 this time.  Wanted to know if there
          was anything else to try.  Told them to get FSCO to check out the
          tape drive.  Or try previous week's tapes.

Paged at 18:25 - The call I answered at 13:05 was aparently listed as open
          for Hardware Support.  Bill Wu finally answered, and referred the
	  call back to Software Support.
Paged at 03:05 Sun - System F38 died with a RIBERR while restoring from TITO
          tapes.  Told them to try again, and call back if it died again.
Paged at 04:02 Sun - F38 died with WRTSAT and BADSAT stopcodes.
          Went on site.  Disk unit BPB3 had 3 soft errors, no had errors.
Paged at 05:55 Sun - Central Dispatch had been trying to get a hold of me
          since 03:05.  While one the phone they tried calling (415)498-3841
          but it did not go through.  Told them to add (408)977-7962 as
          my secondary pager number.  Ross Zoerhoff informed.
07:07 Sun - Several reports of BADSAT all on disk unit BPB3.  This time it
          received 28 hard errors.  That pack is unusable and has been the
          cause of all problems in the last 10 hours.  Told them to call in
          the FE or Rick Daniels to deterine which of the remaining 3 packs
          to use.  The rebuild process will have to be done over again.

SUBJECT:  MIGRATION SCHEDULE FOR PUBLIC NET CODE

___________________________________________________________________________

As you all are aware, we have encountered a hardware problem on the Sun 
Systems which has affected the access to these systems.  (Timing is 
everything in life.)  Since there is no testing time available for the 
field people prior to the Beta test scheduled on 6/19, we have slipped this
date one week.  Beta Test is now scheduled for the week of June 26.  This 
slippage will not affect any other dates previously discussed for 
production migration.


                            CONVERSION SCHEDULE

6/6       Train the trainer.

6/7-6/22  Field testing of Gen and Load.  Field Tech Specialists, Field 
          Service Co., Payment Systems Co., and P.I. Gen and Load lab 
          machines to become familiar with system structure, commands, and
          procedures.

6/19-6/22 Gen and Load nodes at McDonnell Douglas campus and Network 
          Supervisors.

6/19      Projects for Beta Test are identified.  A list of projects 
          including all nodes and slots is distributed to be used for Beta
          Test the week of 6/26.  This list should include projects in as 
          many districts as possible to give the widest possible 
          involvement.  All changes should be done on the PDP 10's this 
          week and nodes genned to have .BND files available if needed.

6/23      All .TYM files and .CMD files are moved to the Sun Systems.  
          Begin generation of .NIB files, both node and slot for Beta Test
          projects.  If any slot is involved in a project, all slots and 
          node code will be genned and reloaded from Unix.  If any node is
          involved for line reconfiguration, etc., all slots will also be 
          done on the Unix System.  We cannot have half the production code
          for a node on Sun and half on the PDP 10.

6/26      Begin Beta Test.  All node and slots will be loaded from the Sun
          Systems.  Any error or problems encountered will be reported to 
          Phillippe Michel for node code, the responsible Tech Specialist 


          for slot code, or Carl Baltrunas for systems problems.  First 
          attempt will be to correct the problem, .TYM or .CMD file errors 
          corrected, versions verified, etc.  If resolution is not 
          possible, then fall back to the project code (.BND file) on the 
          PDP 10.  All problems encountered, whether resolved or resulting 
          in a fall back to the .BND file, should be documented in an 
          ontyme to Carl Baltrunas (TXS.C/BALTRUNAS) and Jack Snavely 
          (NSC.J/SNAVELY).

6/30      End Beta Test.  Resume normal operations on the PDP 10's.

7/5-7/7   Evaluation - Any difficulties during Beta Test resolved, loading
          statistics analyzed, and all user directories moved to Unix.

7/7       All .TYM and .CMD files moved to the Sun Systems.

7/10      All new Gens begin on Sun Systems.  Projects for this week will 
          be loaded from PDP 10's, but projects for the week of 7/17 will 
          be done on the Sun Systems.  In addition, all nodes in the 2000-
          2777 range not affected by projects will be scheduled to be 
          loaded from the Sun Systmes the week of 7/17.  This schedule will 
          be published 7/7 with the day for each load.  All slots and node
          code must be done, so insure your code is ready 2 days prior to 
          the load date.  If a slot has not been done prior to loading, 
          your customer will be down.  Expect to be called by Netcon.

7/17      Production - All new code loads will be done from the Sun 
          Systems.  This means that if a slot or node is reconfigured for 
          any reason, all slots and node code must be regenned on the Sun 
          System.

7/14      Schedule published for the migration of 3000-3777 range of nodes
          not yet involved in projects to be loaded the week of 7/14.
7/21      Schedule published for nodes in the 4000 to 5777 range to be 
          loaded the week of 7/31.

7/28      Schedule for all the nodes remaining to be loaded the weeks of 
          8/7 and 8/14.

8/14      Release System 25.

8/31      Release System 54.

9/29      Release System 33.

Subject: INFORMATION's menu now fixed. 

I got a call from Wyatt Moore in Marketing Services (ext 7187) about
the problem.  He did not know who was responsible for the files in
directory MKTGINFO, and was calling around to find someone to help.
I found that ACCES.TXT had been overwritten by a copy of ACCES.LST.
I typed in a new menu for ACCES.TXT and saved a copy in ACCES.FIL, a
new file that has a list of file names and descriptions.   /Joe

Subject: Hotline calls for the past week 

Calls to the PDP-10 Support Hotline:

27-Jun-89 17:30 /Carl
Contact:  was on-site at Fremont when problem occured.
Problem:  System 38 could not find the boot blocks or the home pages.
          Loaded system from tape; all disks were OK except for DSKB0.
          Attempted to re-create the home pages by copying a good set
          off of DSKB1.
Fix:      Problem was a read/write board in the disk drive.  Ran DSKCLN
          in check mode - no real errors.

25-Jun-89 03:15 /Joe (Sunday morning)
Contact:  Fremont Operations, (415)498-2588, Cindy, F74
Problem:  System 74 crashed after several RIB errors, BAD-SATs, other problems.
Diagnosis:Had them bring up the system in MANUAL mode so that I could
          run the ERRCHK program.  It reported that disk BPB4 had accumulated
          20 soft (recoverable) errors since 1-June.
Fix:      They ran the PAKCPY utility and copied the contents of that disk
          to another pack.  23 files were marked as being damaged and have
          been restored from backup tapes.

Subject: Call from Fayez Sarofim 

Monday morning I got a call from Marilyn Bear of Fayez Sarofim (713)654-4484.
The person who had been in charge of their KS-2020 left, and they needed to
have all passwords changed.  Marilyn had changed the OPER license password,
but needed help with the others.  The LVALID program changed the local password
after she logged in as user FS7; I had to telecopy the PASSWO program from
another PDP10 so she could change the TYMNET password for FS7.  Together,
we came up with a new SETE password, which I installed in SYSTEM.SAV and in
the running monitor.

They expected to shut down the KS-2020 on June first, but, as usual, it must
be kept running for another couple of months until the replacement system
is functioning.

Subject: Located cause of "frame capacity exceeced" on D23. 

At 2:25pm CDT, someone logged in as DBTTMS created 6 files in directory
NETDB on system D23.  This person entered these jobs into the SUBMIT queue, set
to go off every 15 minutes.  Because they were entered wrong, these requests
logged in 6 detached jobs every 15 minutes until all available frames were in
use.  At 8:30pm CDT, I received a hotline call from Dallas Operations. They
could not log in to run the billing and accounting programs.  

If these batch SUBMIT jobs had been entered properly, they would have used
the OPER password for MCOLVIN to log in as MCOLVIN, MHILL, and GBAWA on
hosts 7001 and 8458.  Since these hosts are Tymnet MUXes, the end result
would be to steal control away from the persons logged in there.

Today I talked with Mike Hill of Payment Systems Co in New Jersey, phone
(301)840-6106.  He said the he and his supervisor, Metron Colvin, knew
nothing about these SUBMIT jobs.  They had abruptly terminated an employee
on Wednesday, and that is probably the source of the unauthorized jobs.

Hello Stranger...
How have you been? Long time no talk. I hear you ar learning X-Windows?
You must be enjoying the new system... I'll be in Fremont next week. Just
found out today. I'll be helping Operations with the VM stuff, training
them in whatever they need. I'll be sure and stop by one day and see you.
Jenny and Stacey are doing fine, guess what? Number two is on the way!
Jenny is due in early March. We're catching up with you!
Take care, see you sometime next week...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Prior to Carl Baltrunas departing for two weeks hard earned vacation time I 
want to call a program review meeting. Time is 2 pm to 3:30 pm on Tuesday 8 
August in conference room C5-645 (the usual place).

The purpose is to smooth the transition for the interim system support being
provided by Joe Smith (FSC) and Osman Guven (Neteng) in Carl's absence.

Beginning at 3:30 will be a report by D.Hopkins on his evaluation
of USECURE, a Unix security package. If you receive this message you're invited.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after PDP
                to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned that
                UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled twice,
                whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked to 
                assemble patches twice an operand out of range error is
                reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


            1.A.3  Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.  Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.3  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.


                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.

                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

            1.B.4  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.8.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release.

            C.  Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.


            D.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

    II.     Personnel Directory copies between PDP and UNIX is complete.
            Further file transfers are the responsibility of the
            individual using the Net Copy program.

            2.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

                   Update: 7/28  NETQC was not present at the meeting, but
                                 since there is another escalation it is
                                 considered complete.

    III.    Patch directory copy to UNIX is complete.  Further file
            transfers are the responsibility of STS.

            3.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

                   Update: 7/28  Misreported, no problem.  Item dropped
                                 from minutes.

    IV.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            4.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to recontact J. Smith to learn
                                 of this progress on the program.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.

                   Update: 8/4   L. Reed is satisfied she knows how to use
                                 this script.  She'll use this script for
                                 node gens during test period.


            4.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas presently working on
                                 program, will be ready by 1 August.

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas working on three (3) stage
                                 backup procedure.  Phase III, automatic
                                 backup to Malvern for T and C files is
                                 complete.

                   Action: 8/4   J. Smith to work with C. Baltrunas so
                                 that this program is ready prior to
                                 restarting the project.  It is of
                                 critical importance.

            4.1.C  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to develop program that
                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated
                                 completion is 28 July 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Program to be ready 1 August.

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas will finish this program,
                                 test that it works properly and can only
                                 be updated by Netcon, although accessible
                                 for inquiry by all, and document it by
                                 banner message and update to the tech tip
                                 file.

            4.1.D  Action: 7/14  Due to the anticipated volume of 
                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

                                 C. Baltrunas to implement program
                                 controlled method in conjunction with
                                 point 5.1.C.
 
                   Update: 7/24  See update point 7/28 4.1.C.
   
                   Update: 8/4   See point 4.1.C 8/4 update.

    V.      It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            5.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - AES - now participating.

            5.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            5.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            5.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            5.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.
                                 Matthews.

                                 R. Ferguson also reports that T. Kochman
                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.


                   Update: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

    VI.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 7/24  Network connections to Malvern SUN's
                                 installed and operational three days
                                 ahead of agreed to schedule after it was
                                 discovered that a new dual Mini Engine
                                 was needed.  Great work Lisa Baker and Ed
                                 Kalinowski, thanks!

                   Update: 7/28  One Malvern system still experiencing
                                 hardware problems.  SUN to dispatch on 31
                                 July.

                   Update: 8/4   Malvern disk controller fixed.  Disks
                                 formatted and directory structures set
                                 up.

    VII.    It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VIII.   D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen
            procedures to Netcon.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to provide informal hands-on
                                 training and document the code gen
                                 procedure prior to his departure for
                                 Paris.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel to complete by 1 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Michel had meeting with a Netcon rep.
                                 item closed.

    IX.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

    X.      SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh to respond by next meeting.

    XI.     Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guvan and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    XII.    UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.


                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

    XIII.   Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

    XIV.    Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XV.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.


                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.

                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

                   Update: 8/4   A. -  Need banner message and update Tech
                                       Tip file for completion.
                                 B. -  Closed.
                                 C. -  C. Baltrunas - incomplete.
 
    XVI.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 Bits release.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.


                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.

                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release and so will observation
                                 of nodes failing to come up after Load.

            C.   Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                 required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.


            D.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

    II.     Personnel Directory copies between PDP and UNIX is complete.
            Further file transfers are the responsibility of the
            individual using the Net Copy program.

            2.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

                   Update: 7/28  NETQC was not present at the meeting, but
                                 since there is another escalation it is
                                 considered complete.

    III.    P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            3.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to recontact J. Smith to learn
                                 of this progress on the program.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.

                   Update: 8/4   L. Reed is satisfied she knows how to use
                                 this script.  She'll use this script for
                                 node gens during test period.

            3.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas presently working on
                                 program, will be ready by 1 August.



                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas working on three (3) stage
                                 backup procedure.  Phase III, automatic
                                 backup to Malvern for T and C files is
                                 complete.

                   Action: 8/4   J. Smith to work with C. Baltrunas so
                                 that this program is ready prior to
                                 restarting the project.  It is of
                                 critical importance.

            3.1.C  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to develop program that
                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated
                                 completion is 28 July 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Program to be ready 1 August.

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas will finish this program,
                                 test that it works properly and can only
                                 be updated by Netcon, although accessible
                                 for inquiry by all, and document it by
                                 banner message and update to the tech tip
                                 file.

            3.1.D  Action: 7/14  Due to the anticipated volume of 
                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

                                 C. Baltrunas to implement program
                                 controlled method in conjunction with
                                 point 3.1.B.
 
                   Update: 7/24  See update point 7/28 3.1.C.
   
                   Update: 8/4   See point 3.1.C 8/4 update.

    IV.     It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            4.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.


            4.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            4.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            4.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            4.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.
                                 Matthews.

                                 R. Ferguson also reports that T. Kochman
                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

    V.      Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 7/24  Network connections to Malvern SUN's
                                 installed and operational three days

                                 discovered that a new dual Mini Engine
                                 was needed.  Great work Lisa Baker and Ed
                                 Kalinowski, thanks!

                   Update: 7/28  One Malvern system still experiencing
                                 hardware problems.  SUN to dispatch on 31
                                 July.

                   Update: 8/4   Malvern disk controller fixed.  Disks
                                 formatted and directory structures set
                                 up.

    VI.     It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VII.    D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen
            procedures to Netcon.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to provide informal hands-on
                                 training and document the code gen
                                 procedure prior to his departure for
                                 Paris.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel to complete by 1 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Michel had meeting with a Netcon rep.
                                 item closed.

    VIII.   Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.



                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

    IX.     SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh to respond by next meeting.

    X.      Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guvan and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    XI.     UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

 


    XII.    Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

    XIII.   Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XIV.    It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.


                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

                   Update: 8/4   A. -  Need banner message and update Tech
                                       Tip file for completion.
                                 B. -  Closed.
                                 C. -  C. Baltrunas - incomplete.
 
    XV.     PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release.

re: Attached code release by NTD of a new Netcopy


I understand we have had some problems with NETCOPY, thus the new release.
Are the present problems so crutical that we must take aplha code?

If so, then please distribute to the appropriate system locations including
Malvern.

Thanks,

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.


                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.

                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommended that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release and so will observation
                                 of nodes failing to come up after Load.

                   Action: 8/8   NTD made a second release of Bits (2.10
                                 dated 8/8/89) to Program Management on
                                 Tuesday afternoon.  C. Baltrunas to
                                 install in Fremont on Tuesday evening.
                                 L. Reed to instruct Netcon to Load the
                                 ten (10) campus nodes, using Bits dated
                                 8/8/89 and report results.  Also, Netcon
                                 to do timing tests on same three nodes as
                                 was performed three (3) weeks ago.
                                 Report results to H. Matthews on 9
                                 August.

            C.   Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                 required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.


                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.

            D.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    II.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            2.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to recontact J. Smith to learn
                                 of this progress on the program.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.


                   Update: 8/4   L. Reed is satisfied she knows how to use
                                 this script.  She'll use this script for
                                 node gens during test period.

                   Update: 8/8   Item closed.

            2.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to

                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system

    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are


                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 7/24  Network connections to Malvern SUN's

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.





                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

    VII.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.


    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July

                                 findings.

                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on Usecure
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefullness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissable programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 exceute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release

            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XI.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.

                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

                   Update: 8/4   A. -  Complete.
                                 B. -  Complete.
                                 C./D. Baltrunas - complete.
 
    XII.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release.

re: Field Queries

Thanks for addressing the request from Fremont and the patch update last
week. Here are two new ones that have come in the last few days that I'd like
you to respond to.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
	I wish to report that there are these problems in the Sun system:
 
 
   1)  If I delete the files from "Gemini", the deleted files will still exist 
       on "Titan";
 
   2)  If I create some files on "Titan", they won't show on "Gemini";
 
   3)  I am not able to use BITS to load node code on either "Gemini" nor
       "Titan", it works before;
 
   4)  The command "CP" only works if you copy files one by one, it is 
       impossible to copy a group of files from other directory to the present
       directory at one time(such as: 
 
       		> cp ../filename.* *.* 
	 
       it works before).
 
 
       When it's convenient, please let me know what happents.  Thaks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It has been observed that the various methods of doing directory
listings (ex. ls -l) do not show the year of the file creation.  If
this is changeable, please do.  It may not be important now, but
in the future, a year display can be vital.

SUBJECT:  UNIX Migration Program - Interim Update


    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.


                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

                   Update: 8/8   Bits release dated 8/8/89 failed.  NTD
                                 witnessed loads and made changes.

                   Update: 8/16  Bits release dated 8/16/89 failed.

                   Action: 8/17  UNIX team members will witness Bits
                                 testing in Netcon tonight.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.


                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommended that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/17  This change will take place after 24
                                 August.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release and so will observation
                                 of nodes failing to come up after Load.

                   Action: 8/8   NTD made a second release of Bits (2.10
                                 dated 8/8/89) to Program Management on
                                 Tuesday afternoon.  C. Baltrunas to
                                 install in Fremont on Tuesday evening.
                                 L. Reed to instruct Netcon to Load the
                                 ten (10) campus nodes, using Bits dated
                                 8/8/89 and report results.  Also, Netcon
                                 to do timing tests on same three nodes as
                                 was performed three (3) weeks ago.
                                 Report results to H. Matthews on 9
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/17  Alleged Bits speed improvements yet to be
                                 verified as last two Bits releases have
                                 not loaded nodes.  Furthermore, the
                                 report that some nodes do not come into
                                 Network after Bits loads remains
                                 unverified.


            C.   Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                 required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.

            D.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    II.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

                   Update: 8/17  Item Closed.



    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

                   Update: 8/17  Validations waiting signed individual
                                 security agreements before validating FSC
                                 on SUN Systems.


    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.
                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

    VII.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is


            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on USECURE
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefulness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissible programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 execute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

                   Update: 8/17  NTTR.

    IX.     Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.


                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.
 
    X.      Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XI.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Update: 8/17  Complete, item closed.

    XII.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release and loading problems are
                                 resolved.


   XIII.    J. Smith or O. Guven to train Netcon how to use the CKnode
            Program.  This will be scheduled prior to live migration.

SUBJECT:  UNIX Migration Program Review Meeting No. 7


    I.      NEXT MEETING

            3:00 p.m. Friday 25 August C5-645.

    II.     FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            2.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            2.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed


                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

    B.      BITS 

            2.B.1  Bits testing this week show Load times in the 3-6 
                   minute range.  SUCCESS!  Thanks, P. Whitehurst and
                   A. Ko of NTD.

                   There are three related problems of unknown origin that
                   are presently being tested.  DLoading nodes genned and
                   loaded from UNIX; nodes not coming up after Bits Loads
                   and Loading slot codes in sequential order.

                   NTD believes they have a handle on these problems and
                   intend for a new Bits release on Thursday.

    C.      NAD

            2.C.1  Two open escalators to NTD.  One is a question:  how to
                   stop extended DOT display.  The next appears to be a
                   fault:  ? hist command zaps DOT circuit.

    D.      NETCOPY

            2.D.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

    E.      X.25

            2.E.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommends that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/22  This change will occur after 24 August,
                                 even though changes are occurring to X.25
                                 now for change control reasons.

            F.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            2.F.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.





                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  P. Whitehurst to check on fix status.

            G.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            2.G.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  S. Spinale to provide an update on PMTS
                                 progress.  No report on migration access
                                 from ACS.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.



            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

                   Update: 8/17  Validations waiting signed individual
                                 security agreements before validating FSC
                                 on SUN Systems.

                   Action: 8/22  FSC has requested that directories named
                                 Engdiag and betadiag are set up on the
                                 UNIX Systems.  J. Smith to complete.

    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Update: 8/22  Validations is setting up hosts for all
                                 Fremont and Malvern hosts in the USERS
                                 profile.  For now, the first home is the
                                 PDP-10, in the next class position will
                                 be the SUN Server, where the personnel
                                 directory resides, the next three class
                                 positions will have another Fremont
                                 server, then the two Malvern servers.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.



                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  Shall resume now.

    VII.    DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

                   Action: 8/22  Tests this week will call on the changed
                                 files to ensure the daily back-up is
                                 occurring properly.

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

    XII.    PUBLIC NET SUPE LOADING

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith is assigned this task
            and the program shall be ready when the UNIX migration starts.

TRW is having serious problems.  The LUD was missing from the system directory
and could not restore it from tape due to read errors on the tape and a UFD
error on the disk.  The DSKCLN program also reported a RIB error on HOME.SYS.
This was at 2:14pm.  I told them to do a system rebuild.  At 11:28pm, I
was paged by Tina Ngo, who said that the TITO program was reporting read
errors on about 1 of every 3 files.  The monthly saves for June and May
were just as bad.  The system hung during the restore, and now won't
boot the microcode from the tape drive.  It's 2:45am, the FE is being called.

System 33 in Fremont had a servo go out on one disk, now they are picking
up hard read errors.  About 60 bad spots were reported, all on head 29, in
the vicinity of cylinder 400.  They are trying to copy out the pack now,
if that fails, it my take 24 hours to do a rebuild.  This was at 2:35am
(at the same time I had TRW on the line).

There were two problems.  1) Somebody deleted username OPER.  Without this
username, DSKCLN won't run.  2) Something got set wrong in the memory
controller.  This caused the terminal to beep when characters were typed
and caused "DDT" to no be recognized.  Running memory diagnostics caused
the memory controller to be reset.

The monitor requires that the following user names be valid for normal
operation:  SYS, UFD, OPER, XEXEC, SUBMIT, PERPOPER, FTSYS, MPL, SPL.

The first call came in at 11:00pm, Saturday night.  I was on the phone with them
for an hour, trying to get the system up in single user mode to check if the
LUD had been damaged.  We were unable to use the DDT command, and I think it was
due to the memory controller in the KS2020 being in an unusual state.  I had
them call in the FE to run memory diagnostics.  As I expected, the diagnostics
found nothing wrong, but they put the system back into a known state so that
DDT could be used.  The second call was at 3:00pm, Sunday afternoon.  I spent
two hours talking the FE through booting the system, bringing the KS2020 up
in single user mode, and running DSKCLN in check mode.  The DSKCLN program
found nothing wrong with the file structure, however the name "OPER" was not
a valid username on that computer.  After reloading the LSI-11 base, the
system was brought up in "KMC" mode and I was able to log in as "JMS".
After re-instating username OPER, the system came up OK.

The last call from TRW was at 12:55am this morning.  They rebooted (IPL'ed)
the system after an inexperienced operator kept switching tape drives which
caused both tape drives to be hung.  Their written procedure included typing
Control-M to get back to the KS10> prompt which was not working.  I told them
that Control-M was required to generate the FS character on their Teletype
terminal, but the ADM21 terminal they hooked up instead uses Control-\ to
generate that character.  The system was back up by 1:10am (15 minutes).

Two of the last three days testing shows 100% load success rates. If 
tonights (Friday) goes as well we'll start the migration on Monday 16
October. The first nodes on Monday will be 2127, 2143, 2146, 2167, 2207, 2211
2335, 2424, 2404 and 2407. Day two is the node range 2011-2047. Day three
is the node range 2050-2125. Day four node range is 2126-2200. Day five (or
Friday October 20) is node range 2221-2342.

By close of business Monday I will have a more detailed letter covering
policies and procedures of the migration. I would like a conference call
on Tuesday or Wednesday after you've had time to read my message Monday to
cover any questions.

________________________________________________________________

 
Migrations of Public Network nodes will begin the evening of 
Monday, 16 October.  The last two known load bugs are solved.
The first was solved in a September 28th release where nodes
would not come up after loading.  The second bug was not in
Bits at all, but was caused by the absence of several X-25 
patches.  Three of the last four days testing shows 100%
first time load success which satisfied Operations acceptance
criteria.
 
I.   SCHEDULE
 
     Nodes will be loaded after 6PM PDT by Netcon.  Field C.S.
     must deliver code to the NetLoad directory on Saturn five
     (5) days (48 hours for the first week loads) prior to the
     scheduled time of the load.  PI will insure slot code for
     all slots is present and if so, will place the node on the
     load schedule.  If all slot codes are not present, PI will 
     escalate to P. Kiefer and the responsible Tech Manager.  If
     slot code is not present 48 hours after that, I will escalate
     to M. Lonergan.
 
     Because Bits uses the DLoad username to build node load
     circuits, Netcon is the only group or person allowed to load
     nodes from the UNIX systems.  A new release of Bits in December
     or January will fix this so others can load nodes with
     functionality similar to loadii.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
     16 October     2127, 2143, 2146, 2167, 2207, 2211, 2335,
                    2424, 2404, 2407.
     17 October     2011   to   2047
     18 October     2050   to   2125
     19 October     2126   to   2200
     20 October     2221   to   2342
     23 October     2342   to   2537
     24 October     2540   to   2721
     25 October     2722   to   3121
     26 October     3122   to   3306
     27 October     3307   to   3511
     30 October     3512   to   3704
     31 October     3705   to   4100
      1 November    4102   to   4370
      2 November    4371   to   4540
      3 November    4541   to   4660
 
     I will continue to publish schedules as appropriate, giving
     (7) days notice.  Using this schedule, I'll hope to turn off
     at least one PDP 10 by the end of the year.
 
II.  EXCLUSIONS         

     For various reasons, all Public Net nodes cannot be
     immediately converted.  This list documents the exclusions,
     their reasons, and a target date to migrate them.
 
     A.  Payment Systems   DLoad password    Mid-January 1990
 
     B.  Ontyme Systems    DLoad password    Mid-January 1990
 
     C.  Subnets           DLoad password    1Q90
 
     D.  FSC Lab Nodes     DLoad password    Mid-January 1990
 
     E.  Nodes outside continental U.S., MDSI not ready
                                             13 November
 
     F.  NetCon Nodes      Netcon Controls System
                                              13 November
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.  OTHER POINTS

     A.  Field C.S.'s shall copy personal directories from the
         PDP 10 to the UNIX systems.  The Tym and Tym5 
         directories are automatically copied each day.
 
     B.  BBXS 6.02 must be used; earlier versions of BBXS will
         not gen under UNIX NAD.
 
     C.  Anyone that wants an entire node loaded must call
         Netcon because password restriction of the DLoad
         username is mandatory.
 
     D.  If there is ever any question about which system (PDP or
         UNIX) the target node was genned on, the questioner
         should run "CKNODE (node no) (node no)" on the UNIX
         systems.  This program keeps track of nodes running under
         UNIX or under the PDP.  At no time should nodes be
         genned half UNIX, half PDP.  This will lead to confusion
         and possible downtime for customers.  Netcon, after a
         successful load, will update CKNODE once the node is
         converted to UNIX.  Once under UNIX, there is no return.
 
     E.  Definition of a Successful Load.
 
         1.  Node comes up with all slots.
             Slots do not have to be answered, but they have to
             show at least down or shut.  If they show down or
             shut, Netcon will open a ticket for the C.S.  If
             they do not show at all, Netcon will reload from
             the PDP and report a failed cutover attempt to me.
 
         2.  Node comes up with all T201 lines.
             If a T201 line does not come up, Netcon will open a 
             ticket for PI.  If the line that does not come up
             is a deadened node, Netcon will reload from the PDP
             and report a failed cutover attempt to me.
 
     To carry out the above plan, Netcon must probe snap every
     node before loading via UNIX.
 
     After meeting the above criteria, Netcon will update the
     CKNODE program and that node is deemed converted to UNIX.
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     F.  Problem Reporting.
 
         UNIX backup systems contain a mirror make of the
         primary systems (except NIB files).  If a primary
         system  is giving problems, users should log into
         the backup systems to do their work.
 
         Normal escalation procedures apply.  If the problem
         is deemed to be related to node code, ISIS or any
         other Tymnet interface escalate to STS.  If the
         problem is related to the UNIX system or 
         environment, escalate to *** Sunescal.  In an
         emergency, call CRAIG FLETCHER at X6250,  CARL
         BALTRUNAS at X6206, or myself at X6078.  Fremont
         Operations can page us in emergencies, too.
 
     G.  STS is responsible to put all authorized patches on
         the UNIX systems.  HTS is responsible to put all
         diagnostics on the UNIX systems.  NTD is responsible
         to move all Source and Beta Test to the UNIX systems.
 
         Should there be files or programs missing on the UNIX
         systems, contact the same people you would if these
         files were missing on the PDP, the responsible party.

SUBJECT>   Unix Migration - Bulletin # 1


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


It is clear now that my message dated 6 October numbered M82652 RE Unix
migration did not contain as much detail as is required. One particular
area regards field C.S. submitting slot code for the nodes on the 
Unix migration schedule. 

When the schedule calls for node xxxxx to be converted on date YY the field
C.S. shall gen the target code on the Unix system. This code is what is
actually running in node at present and should not contain any changes. We ask 
that changes are not introduced at migration time because multiple
changes will make debugging more difficult if cutover of that node fails.

Furthermore, if the conversion fails (for whatever reason) reverting to the
PDP will be more difficult than without the change since the change was
probably only made on the Unix system. So please restrict introduction
of any change as the node is being converted. Once converted, normal code
maintenance may resume.

After the slot is genned the C.S. shall issue an "update" request (documentation
is in a man page title "update"). An update request is the Unix equivelent
of the PDP backup request. This request asks PI to take each slot code for 
the node to be migrated, assemble the code and place it on the load schedule.
Once the C.S. submits an update request and the node is converted to Unix, all
subsequent changes shall occur on the Unix system. An update request will 
deliver cXX, nXX, and and tXX files for that slot.

In the update request the C.S. MUST specify that the update request is for
                                                                Page  2

the Unix migration or a project. Initially, all update requests will be for  
the migration but once we get underway there will be projects that come along
in the normal course of events that require new slot code or node code. PI
needs to review each update request and act on them. PI's actions for migration
update requests and normal project update requests is different, therefore, we
ask that the C.S. specify (if fact, the update script prompts the user for this
information) what the update request is for.

I'm sure more bulletins will be required on these matters so until then...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


In the last twenty four hours there was several escalations from field C.S.
that the backup process from the PDP TYM and TYM5 directories is not working.
In both instances it is proved that it is working but the confusion lies in
executing the NODE GET command. NODE GET must be told where to get the file
from. To get a file from the production directory you must tell GET to get
from production (/TYM/X/YYYYY) directory. Using the flexibility of UNIX when
executing GET files can come from your personal directory, NETLOAD, other 
directories or the production directory.

In both instances the right files are in the production directory and the C.S.
executed the GET command correctly. The only thing that wasn't done was
to tell the GET script where to go and get the files. If you don't tell GET to
go to the production directory it won't.

Please read the MAN pages on GET, PUT, GEN, LOOK and UNGET. These instruct how
to properly execute these programs. As always should questions arise use
*** SUNESCAL.

Field C.S. - please check the production directory prior to sumitting UPDATE
requests for the migration. This extra step takes little time and
insures all TYM and TYM5 files are copied to UNIX production. Secondly it
makes sure the most up to date code is loaded into the node on the night of
the migration.

I made a mistake in paragraph 4 Unix Bulletin No.1 Ontyme No. M82XXX. The 
sentence reads "(documentation is in a man page title 'update')". The man page
which outlines the update request in titled "node". I regret any problems this
may have caused you.

Subject: Missing Slot code for Mondays Unix migration loads 
Monday'sUnixLoadSchedule: 

to: ** UNIXDIST
fr: Harry Matthews
re: Monday's Unix Load Schedule

As of 10 AM PDT today the following node slot files were missing for Monday
the 16th load schedule.

2127	slots 1 and 2
2143	slot 3
2146	slot 3
2167	slot 2
2207	slot 1
2211 	slot code is present dated 11 Aug but no update request
2335	same as n 2211
2424	slots 1 and 2
2404 	OK
2407	on original load schedule but removed because this node has a PSC
	slot. This node must wait till February for conversion.


Please deliver slot code as early Monday morning as possible for the missing 
slots so we can get these nodes converted Monday evening. 

NOTE: each slot code delivered must be delivered using the update command, 
we will use an automated program to extract missing slot code
which relies on submissions using update.

Also, nodes scheduled for load Tuesday night should already be
submitted. PI will check Monday and notify you of any missing codes.

Contact: TYMNET-NIS in Tokyo, Tim Stafford, 011(81-3)551-6220
Contact: Tymnet Customer Support, Elaine, (703)442-7875
Symptom: The command "R PCOM;ND1234.CTL" on system 37 did not start the
	PCOM job that they were using to gen Engine code.  It just sat there.
	Tim called the Dallas Data Center and got the hotline page number.
Problem: No free PTY pairs were available.  Running (CARL)TTYTAB showed them
	as all being marked "Zapped, Gone!".
Cause:	Unknown, it has been observed before, but not to the extent of
	having all lines 201, 203, 205, ... 307 all out of commission.
Fix:	Manually zeroed out LDBLOG on all PTY lines by using MDDT, ^W,
	-1$0G, LINTAB+201/, <tab>, .+LDBLOG/, 0, etc.

   SYSTEM GETTING BADPAG, RIBERR, RIBHRE AND WRTSAT
   MESSAGES BEFORE IT CRASHED WITH STOPCODE 'UFDER1'. JOE SMITH CONTACTED
   AND SAID TO BRING SYSTEM BACK UP.  FULL DSKCLN DONE AT 8:21.
	DATE:  10-15-89   DOWN:  0912   ANS:  1845
   ALL ATTEMPTS TO COPY OUT 300203 (PER JOE SMITH) FAILED.
   COPY WOULD ABORT. JOE CAME IN AND FIXED BAD PAGES AND ANOTHER 
   ATTEMPT TO COPY OUT 300203 WAS MADE. IT ABORTED WITH UUO ERROR.
   A ONE PACK ASP WAS THEN DONE FOR DSKB3 PER JOE. THE SAVE
   AND RESTORE WENT WELL. BPA1 (300203) IS NOW ON DRIVE D1.
   IT WAS PREVIOUSLY ON DRIVE F1. SYSTEM  WAS RUN THRU A FULL
   DSKCLN AFTER RESTORE AND CAME UP WITH NO PROBLEMS.
Problem:  The system detected a bad block on the disk.  While it was
	attempting to mark the bad block in the BAT pages, it thought
	it got another write error, and ended up putting garbage in
	the BAT page.  The PAKCOPY program refused to copy the data to
	a net disk pack because it said the BAT page was invalid.
Fix:	  I went to the Data Center and manually initialized the BAT pages
	on DSKB3.  I ran a full DSKCLN in CONSOLE mode; it reported only
	two files damaged.  Ironically, one was the log file from my
	program that runs at 7:30am to find damaged files and report them.
	In the process of checking the file system, two soft data errors
	were detected on DSKB3.  I recommended that they copy out the pack.
	PAKCOPY aborted during the copy; they then used the ASP program to
	copy that one pack to tape, and restore it on another disk pack.


10-Oct-89 10:25 /Joe
Contact:   Fremont Operations, (415)498-2588
Problem:   Bad spot on DSKB10 caused the SATs and LUD.SYS to be damaged.
Fix:	LUD.SYS was restored from the previous night's backup tape.
	Since DSKCLN cannot start until LUD.SYS is restored, and since
	the SATs had not been rewritten because DSKCLN had not run, then
	the newly restored LUD.SYS used pages that were allocated to
	another file.  It was the usual 29 minutes for a FULL DSKCLN,
	29 more minutes for pass two of DSKCLN, and 15 minutes of output
	to the CTY listing each and every multiply-used page.  LUD.SYS
	was re-restored, and the system came up OK.
Note:  The problem on 2-Oct was with DSKB0, this time it was DSKB10.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


We didn't have a real good night last night regarding Unix loads. PI
submitted 39 nodes and 6 were completed. Nodes uncompleted are: 2015, 2017
2023, 2027, 2053, 2054, 2055, 2056, 2047, 2013, 2014, 2031, 2033, 2036, 2041
2042, 2032, 2026, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2051, 2062, 2063, 2065, 2067, 2070, 2072,
2070, 2073, 2105, 2106, 2125, 7154, and 4745. Completed nodes are updated in 
CKNODE.

Many of the failed nodes are either 5.33 switchers or 6.35 Consats, in
any event all the failed nodes are returned to service running PDP codes.

Ten failed nodes had too many passthroughs to reload, one node was already
down as a result of the earthquake, time did not allow nine nodes to be
reloaded, six succeeded, and there were 13 Unix related failures. 
Of the 33 failures, 60% can be attributed to the earthquake, therefore, 
we have to do more nodes tonight to catch up for the low amount the last
two nights. The 13 Unix related failures are a surprise. By Unix
related I define as relating to the new enviroment (Sun, Unix OS, file naming
conventions, new path mechanisms, and Bits). Eight of the thirteen
failed when Bits reported zero records received, two other problems were
appearently caused because Netcon could not access the servers, 
one node loaded but didn't come up, and Bits reported load failures with
new error messages.

Zero records recieved and server access failures appear to be procedural
problems since we haven't seen this report before and the servers were
operational throughout the night. Regardless of appearences we'll investigate
                                                                Page  2

these failures further. Nodes that failed to come after Bits loads was reported
fixed in a 9/28 release of Bits and our testing found this true. We'll
look at this again though, as well as the new error messages. 

To summarize, we'll investigate the failures and report back to you on our
findings and continue on schedule. Tonight we'll re-try last night
failures as well as load tonights scheduled node list.

Due to the number of CS's escalating problems for missing patch files I
announce a short delay for Isis slot and node migrations.  Appearently, STS
patches and NTD sources are available on Unix but the source patches are not.
We are taking steps right now to fix this by putting source patch files for
all products on the Unix systems via tape and electronic distribution methods. 

This delay only effects customer Isis slots, migration of 5.33 switcher code
will continue. Right now there is approximately 30 nodes in the network running
from Unix, 14 of these are customer nodes. Due to the absence of source patch
files problems may be experienced with these and Netcon is prepared to revert
back to the PDP as necessary.

I will contact everyone when slot code sysgens can resume. Hopefully,
this will be tommarrow and in the meantime I'll plan how to restart the 
migration in full.

I wanted to drop you this short note to let you know that Netcon successfully
converted 14 nodes to Unix last night (without failures) running 5.33 switcher 
code. Although the migration of customer ISIS nodes is delayed because of
the absence of source patch files, migration of switcher code continues since
we know all the files are present for this code.

We have looked very closely at the 33 failed conversion attempts on Wednesday
night and I have determined most of these to be procedural problems, not 
technical problems. Steps are implemented to solve these so I am confident that
the migration will resume in full next week.

The missing source patch files are on the Unix systems now. We are in 
the process of verifying file integrity, insuring we have all the necessary
files and we'll then distribute to the appropriate directory once we complete  
the task. Furthermore, steps are underway to insure that the Unix systems are 
updated using the same methods as exist today with the PDP's.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


We didn't have a real good night last night regarding Unix loads. PI
submitted 39 nodes and 6 were completed. Nodes uncompleted are: 2015, 2017
2023, 2027, 2053, 2054, 2055, 2056, 2047, 2013, 2014, 2031, 2033, 2036, 2041
2042, 2032, 2026, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2051, 2062, 2063, 2065, 2067, 2070, 2072,
2070, 2073, 2105, 2106, 2125, 7154, and 4745. Completed nodes are updated in 
CKNODE.

Many of the failed nodes are either 5.33 switchers or 6.35 Consats, in
any event all the failed nodes are returned to service running PDP codes.

Ten failed nodes had too many passthroughs to reload, one node was already
down as a result of the earthquake, time did not allow nine nodes to be
reloaded, six succeeded, and there were 13 Unix related failures. 
Of the 33 failures, 60% can be attributed to the earthquake, therefore, 
we have to do more nodes tonight to catch up for the low amount the last
two nights. The 13 Unix related failures are a surprise. By Unix
related I define as relating to the new enviroment (Sun, Unix OS, file naming
conventions, new path mechanisms, and Bits). Eight of the thirteen
failed when Bits reported zero records received, two other problems were
appearently caused because Netcon could not access the servers, 
one node loaded but didn't come up, and Bits reported load failures with
new error messages.

Zero records recieved and server access failures appear to be procedural
problems since we haven't seen this report before and the servers were
operational throughout the night. Regardless of appearences we'll investigate
                                                                Page  2

these failures further. Nodes that failed to come after Bits loads was reported
fixed in a 9/28 release of Bits and our testing found this true. We'll
look at this again though, as well as the new error messages. 

To summarize, we'll investigate the failures and report back to you on our
findings and continue on schedule. Tonight we'll re-try last night
failures as well as load tonights scheduled node list.

What has to happen now is:

1. PI (L.Reed) should regen all converted and pending conversion nodes
   that use 5.22 node code. Nodes already converted will not be reloaded. 
   The newly genned code should replace the old code in the production
   directory.

2. Netcon should reload the newly genned code when circumstances demand.

3. C.S.'s should regen their codes if they have any slots which were missing
   any of the above files. After regen submit an UPDATE request marked 
   "REGEN" and we'll place these on the load schedule.

Other information:

A. Sixty four nodes are converted to Unix and more occur each day. Before
   troubleshooting a node use CKNODE to determine where the production code
   is.

B. Customer ISIS node conversions will resume tonight. 5.33 switcher code
   code conversions continue.

Here is a handy tip to check which nodes are converted to Unix. Log into the
Unix systems and type:

			cknode -a | grep sun

This command gives you all nodes converted to Unix.

			cknode -a | grep mm/dd

This command gives you all nodes converted to Unix on a specific date. A
good use for the date arguement is to find out which nodes were converted
last night. Use this when you come in, first thing in the AM. You should be able
to tell from the node number if your customer was converted last night because
Netcon updates cknode right after a successful Unix cutover.

It appears the original Unix migration schedule published 6 October is too
agressive. We have had great difficulties keeping up with it. For
example, by today we should have well over 200 nodes converted, in fact we
have 90. According to the original schedule we should be converting nodes in
the 2722 - 3121 range tonight. In an effort to maintain control of this and
get the migration running smoothly we'll not convert customer ISIS nodes
above node number 3121 (switchers will continue).

C.S's should continue to submit update requests, if you have not already done 
so, for ISIS nodes numbered below 3121. We'll catch up on the nodes numbered  
below 3121 prior to moving the migration forward past this number.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



The attached schedule looks ahead one week for nodes that will be converted
to Unix and which day the load will be attempted. This schedule supercedes
all previous schedules and is designed to keep the conversions moving ahead
while adjusting our methods to a new ways of doing things.

I will publish new schedules on Thursday of each week for the upcoming week.
A schedule improvement is implemented to cope with nodes scheduled
but not converted for whatever reason. If a node is scheduled for conversion
on day X and is not converted it will automatically be rescheduled for
another conversion attempt in 7 calender days. For example, if node 2010
is scheduled for conversion on Tuesday and the conversion fails it will
be placed on the next week schedule for a Tuesday conversion. This is
an effective way to keep everyone informed so that everyone can inform their
customers and we can manage the information better.

P.I. is checking right now for the update submissions for all nodes scheduled
for tonight thru Tuesday, and will be sending an OnTyme today asking
for any slot code which is missing. Please check if you have slots on these 
nodes and submit update requests quickly.
