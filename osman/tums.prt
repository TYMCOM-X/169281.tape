    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.


                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

                   Update: 8/8   Bits release dated 8/8/89 failed.  NTD
                                 witnessed loads and made changes.

                   Update: 8/16  Bits release dated 8/16/89 failed.

                   Action: 8/17  UNIX team members will witness Bits
                                 testing in Netcon tonight.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.


                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommended that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/17  This change will take place after 24
                                 August.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release and so will observation
                                 of nodes failing to come up after Load.

                   Action: 8/8   NTD made a second release of Bits (2.10
                                 dated 8/8/89) to Program Management on
                                 Tuesday afternoon.  C. Baltrunas to
                                 install in Fremont on Tuesday evening.
                                 L. Reed to instruct Netcon to Load the
                                 ten (10) campus nodes, using Bits dated
                                 8/8/89 and report results.  Also, Netcon
                                 to do timing tests on same three nodes as
                                 was performed three (3) weeks ago.
                                 Report results to H. Matthews on 9
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/17  Alleged Bits speed improvements yet to be
                                 verified as last two Bits releases have
                                 not loaded nodes.  Furthermore, the
                                 report that some nodes do not come into
                                 Network after Bits loads remains
                                 unverified.


            C.   Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                 required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.

            D.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    II.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

                   Update: 8/17  Item Closed.



    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

                   Update: 8/17  Validations waiting signed individual
                                 security agreements before validating FSC
                                 on SUN Systems.


    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.
                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

    VII.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is


            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                            findings.

                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on USECURE
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefulness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissible programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 execute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

                   Update: 8/17  NTTR.

    IX.     Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.


                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.
 
    X.      Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XI.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Update: 8/17  Complete, item closed.

    XII.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release and loading problems are
                                 resolved.


   XIII.    J. Smith or O. Guven to train Netcon how to use the CKnode
            Program.  This will be scheduled prior to live migration.
