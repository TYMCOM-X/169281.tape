 
  1. Security - The future data base  should be located on a secure system 
                which will provide protection against unauthorized access.
                The system should also provide a detail log of access
                activities.
 
  2. Storage  - The future data base should be able to store very large
                volume of data so that we will not worry about the storage
                when business growing.
 
  3. Language Interface - We should choose a data base which can face with
                          standard ASM, FORTRAN, PASCAL etc. language without
                          depending on software support.
 
  4. Recovery - The new data base should possess automatic recovery capability.
 
  5. Communication capabilty - The system where the new data base located
                               should be able to talk to other systems through
                               auxiliary circuit.
 
  6. Others - It will be much easier (as a programmer points of view) for
              developing the validation programs if the new data base is a
              relational data base with DBL (supporting data base language).
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
                          FUTURE DATA BASE STRUCTURE
                          ------ ---- ---- ---------
 
 It will consist of 4 parts:
 
 1. CUSTDB - AST, CID (CHARGE NO.), CUSNAM, ADDRESS, DIST, INVCODE, PRICODE, 
             SALESNO, DSTART, DSTOP, COSTC (DEPT. NO.).
 
 2. USERDB - UNAME, GAN, UUN, CID, DIST, HOST, DSTART, DSTOP, COSTC.
 
 3. TUSRDB - UNAME, GAN, UUN, CID, DIST, MUUN, DSTART, DSTOP, COSTC.
 
 4. TYMHST - MUUN, HOST, DSTART, DSTOP.
 
 5. Tables - HOSTDB, ACTSYSDB, COSTC/DIST etc.
 
 
 
 
 
 
                        FUTURE VALIDATIONS PROCESSING
                        ------ ----------- ----------
 
 
USRVAL/TYMVAL will update MUD and LUD directly, but only provide data retrival
for accounting data base. All the accounting update will be put into a file
which will be processed at night. The new cid will be assigned right after
the request is completed, therefore there will be no more "new customer, new
user" requests. The accounting update will start CUSTDB update first, USERDB
the second then TUSRDB.
 
Do we need immediate update by Vida or Jan? how?
TYMVAL - update MUD directly. All accounting updates will be put into a file
         which will be processed later (periodically). The other alternative
         is to update MUD and accounting data base directly.
 
USRVAL - as it is now.
