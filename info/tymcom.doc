          This manual is designed to aid the user in tailoring an ISIS Asynch-
          ronous TYMCOM to  meet the needs of his environment.   The manual is
          organized in nine major sections.

          The first  section provides background on  the basic functions  of a
          TYMCOM and an introduction to the remainder of the manual.

          The second  section describes  the TYMCOM options  that are  used to
          define the hardware environment in which  the TYMCOM will be operat-
          ing.

          The third  section describes options  that affect  the accessibility
          and functions of the TYMCOM Operations Manager.

          The fourth section describes global options for the TYMCOM software.

          The fifth section describes host level  options for the TYMCOM soft-
          ware.

          The sixth  section describes  subhost level  options for  the TYMCOM
          software.

          The  seventh section  describes port  level options  for the  TYMCOM
          software.

          The eighth section is a summary of all the options that may be spec-
          ified for a TYMCOM.

          The  ninth  section  contains  a  sample  ISIS  Asynchronous  TYMCOM
          Tymfile.

          SECTION 1.0 INTRODUCTION          ________________________

          This manual describes the  features available on the  ISIS Asynchro-
          nous TYMCOM.  The features and options  described in this manual are
          set at system generation.  Interactive access  to the TYMCOM when it
          is  running is  provided  by the  TYMCOM  Operations Manager  (TOM).
          Refer to the TOM User's Guide for details on the options that may be                       ________________
          changed while the TYMCOM is running.

          A concise sysgen command language has  been developed for the TYMCOM
          which provides the user with complete  control over the tailoring of
          the TYMCOM to suit his environment.   Most options have defaults and
          need not be  specified unless they are to be  changed.  This feature
          enables a user to create a TYMCOM  ranging from the fastest and most
          efficient one, to  one well suited for a field  test environment, in
          which all  options are specified to  allow high visibility  of minor
          changes.


          SECTION 1.1 Overview          ____________________

          An ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM  provides a set of  individual asynchro-
          nous line interfaces to an attached  host computer.  It appears to a
          host computer as a bank of  asynchronous dial-up modems or asynchro-
          nous terminals, depending on the  configuration.  The TYMCOM runs in
          a job slot on an ISIS node,  and communicates with the host computer
          over asynchronous lines using asynchronous I/O cards (called asynch-
          ronous ports) and SIO motherboard cards (called SIO ports).  Asynch-
          ronous ports  use EIA RS-232 signal  protocol supporting 8 bit  or 5
          bit characters.  SIO ports use EIA RS-232 signal protocol supporting
          8 bit characters or using a subset of X.20 protocol supporting 5 bit
          characters.

          The speed a TYMCOM can support is selected in one of the two follow-
          ing ranges:

               (1)  50 - 75   baud Baudot
                    75 - 1200 baud ASCII
                    75 - 9600 baud SIO ASCII or Baudot

                             or

               (2)  300 - 4800 baud ASCII
                    75  - 9600 baud SIO ASCII or Baudot

          On heavily loaded machines the  overall throughput capability of the
          slot may occasionally  limit the character rate  of individual ports
          to less than  full capacity.  Also, the  origination (terminal), and
          the network access to  it may limit the  overall throughput capabil-
          ity.  The TYMCOM is normally located  on-site with the host computer
          hardware.





                                                        INTRODUCTION    Page 1


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          Under TYMNET II, the TYMCOM allows  definitions of up to 128 network
          hosts, though the Supervisor may restrict  this to a smaller number.
          When operating under  TYMNET I, ISIS only allows one  host per slot,
          limiting each TYMCOM to one host.

          Up to 128 subhosts may be specified for the entire TYMCOM.  The num-
          ber of subhosts  may be greater than  the total number of  ports, as
          ports may be  reassigned dynamically by using  the TYMCOM Operations
          Manager  (TOM) while  the  TYMCOM is  running  (see  the TOM  User's
          Guide).

          The ISIS  TYMCOM allows up  to a total  of 128 asynchronous  and SIO
          ports to be specified.   Ports can be grouped in a  number of useful
          ways, allowing  great flexibility.  For example,  asynchronous ports
          and SIO ports can be configured on the same job slot.

          The ISIS  TYMCOM provides  a stored message  facility that  allows a
          customer to specify a message to be printed on user terminals when a
          host is down, or when a port does not answer.

          Many of  the ISIS  TYMCOM options may  be displayed  and manipulated
          using the TOM, which is an  interactive monitoring and control proc-
          ess within the TYMCOM.  The TOM  can be accessed through a hardwired
          port on the TYMNET Engine or through a normal virtual circuit in the
          network.


          SECTION 1.2 Signal Protocol          ___________________________

          The ISIS Asynchronous  TYMCOM  is designed to  communicate with host
          computers at speeds of 75 to  4800 baud over asynchronous lines, and
          at speeds of 75 to 9600 baud  using SIO lines employing certain sub-
          sets of the EIA  RS-232C signal protocol and  X.20 signalling stand-
          ards.  Some capabilities of these subsets are provided by the use of
          various cable  pin configurations which  must be specified  when the
          Engine hardware is ordered.  Some capabilities  are provided by TYM-
          COM options chosen when the TYMCOM  software is generated.  Some may
          be changed dynamically   while the TYMCOM is running, by  the use of
          TOM  commands.   The  initial values  of these  dynamic options  are
          chosen when the TYMCOM is generated.


          1.2.1 Software Signal Protocol                ________________________

          The TYMCOM  has the ability to  detect two control signals  from the
          host, and to manipulate two control signals toward the host for each
          port.   The control  signals that  are detected  and controlled  are
          selected by the cable pin configuration on a port by port basis, and
          are determined by the  mode in which the TYMCOM  will operate.  Nor-
          mally, the TYMCOM is used as a  DCE (Data Circuit Terminating Equip-
          ment), and appears to the host as  a bank of modems.  The TYMCOM can
          also be used as a DTE (Data  Terminal Equipment), and will appear to
          the host as several hardwired terminals.



                                                        INTRODUCTION    Page 2


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          In the following description of the TYMCOM software signal protocol,
          it is assumed  that the TYMCOM is  functioning as a DCE  using cable
          option one (see below).  For ASCII ports,  the signals from the TYM-
          COM are  DSR (Data  Set Ready)  and RI  (Ring Indicator).   If cable
          option one is chosen, the signal from the host is DTR (Data Terminal
          Ready).  Two leads  are present, but the  second is tied to  the DTR
          lead.   The TYMCOM  software  actually uses  both  input signals  to
          determine the  current signal state.  If  either signal is  low, the
          signal state is considered low.  Both input signals must be high for
          the signal state to be high.

          Initially, with no call  active, DSR and RI are low,  and DTR may be
          either low or high.  When the TYMCOM has  a call for a port, it will
          set RI high, and will expect DTR to come high in response.  The TYM-
          COM samples input signals approximately  every 50 milliseconds.  The
          state of the input leads is the value in effect at the time the sam-
          ple occurs.   Two consecutive matching  samples are  required before
          the signal state is considered stable.   This requires that a change
          in signal  state must  be presented  for more  than 50  milliseconds
          before the TYMCOM will detect the change.

          Several  TYMCOM  sysgen options  affect  this  stage of  the  signal
          sequence, as follows:

               - RINGTO specifies the number of seconds the TYMCOM will ring a
                 port before disconnecting the user.

               - RNGTG specifies  whether the  TYMCOM will  toggle ring  every
                 half second,  or will keep  ring high throughout  the ringing
                 period.

               - PCAN specifies the procedure used to determine if a port is a
                 candidate for ringing.  The two  candidate types are IFUP and
                 SIGNAL.  An IFUP  port is considered available  unless it has
                 been declared SHUT  or DOWN by a TOM command.   A SIGNAL port
                 is considered availabnly when DTR is high,  and the port
                 has not been declared SHUT or DOWN  by a TOM command.  Candi-
                 date type may be changed dynamically while the TYMCOM is run-
                 ning.

               - Once DTR is detected, RI is dropped and DSR is set high.  DSR
                 and DTR will both remain high throughout the remainder of the
                 call.

               - Setting the RNGTG and RNGDR options  off at Sysgen allows the
                 RI  signal to  be  used for  a  private  line protocol  which
                 requires a signal to be raised  to indicate an incoming call,
                 and to remain high until the call is terminated.

               - As soon as the host detects DSR high, it may send data on the
                 line (TD, Transmitted  Data).  The DTRP option  specifies how
                 long the  TYMCOM will  delay sending data  to the  host, thus
                 allowing the host time to recognize the DSR signal.



                                                        INTRODUCTION    Page 3


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



               - If a call is terminated from  the caller's side (for example,
                 the user  hangs up or the  circuit is lost), the  TYMCOM will
                 drop  DSR.   The port  will  not  normally be  available  for
                 another call until the host drops DTR in response.  The HDROP
                 option specifies the  maximum length of time  that the TYMCOM
                 will wait for  this response.  If the host  does not normally
                 drop DTR, the value of this option should be zero.

               - The RLSPT option specifies whether  the port will be released
                 for reassignment or  declared hung if the  time limit expires
                 before DTR is dropped.

          When the  host wishes to  terminate a call,  it must drop  DTR.  The
          circuit to the caller will then be cleared, and DSR will be set low.
          DSR will  remain low  until the  next call  is presented.   The port
          should be available for the next call one half second after the TYM-
          COM detects the dropping of DTR.

          For SIO  ports using 5 bit  characters (Baudot ports),  separate DTR
          and DSR signals are  not used.  Instead, the data lines  are used to
          signal call creation  and termination.  In the idle  state, both the
          RD and TD lines are in the spacing state.  When a call comes in, the
          TYMCOM changes RD to the marking state.  The host then changes TD in
          response, and data transfer can begin.   The TYMCOM will terminate a
          call by setting RD  to spacing;  the host is expected  to respond by
          doing the same to  TD.  The host can terminate a  call by setting TD
          to spacing and the TYMCOM will respond on RD.


          1.2.2 Hardware Signal Protocol and Cable Options                __________________________________________

          The signals  that are  actually presented to  and received  from the
          host can be varied by the selection of cable options.  There are two
          standard pin configurations  available, and special cables  or cable
          adapters may be ordered to suit customer requirements as long as the
          software protocol described in the previous section is satisfied.

          Cable Option 1          ______________

          The first  pin configuration  is used for  host ports  that normally
          expect  to communicate  with  a terminal  using  a  modem.  In  this
          configuration, the TYMCOM appears to the host as a modem.

          For asynchronous  ports with  an ASB211  asynchronous card  using an
          ASP74-1 connector  panel, the TYMCOM  is normally interfaced  to the
          host by the following cable combination:

               ASC117-1, and ASC140-20JJ or ASC140-20JP

          The ASC117-1 cable is  available in 15, 25, 35, or  50 foot lengths.
          When ordering, specify  the length needed.  One end  is connected to
          the Engine  hardware with a  37 pin  male connector.  The  other end
          terminates in five male 25 pin EIA connectors, for five ports.



                                                        INTRODUCTION    Page 4


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          One ASC140-20  adapter must be ordered  for each of the  five ports.
          Ports  that do  not use  the adapter  will be  configured for  cable
          option two, described below.  The ASC140-20JJ provides a female con-
          nector to the host equipment; ASC140-20JP provides a male connector.

          The TYMCOM will ring  the host by raising pin 25  (BUSY), which con-
          nects to pin 22 (RI).

          Ring response will be expected on pin 20 (DTR) at the host.

          The TYMCOM will respond  to DTR from the host by  raising DTR at the
          TYMCOM, which connects to  pin 5 (CTS, Clear To Send),  pin 6 (DSR),
          and pin 8 (CD, Carrier Detect) simultaneously at the host.

          The TYMCOM will send data on pin 2 (TD, Transmit Data) which is con-
          nected to pin  3 (RD, Received Data)  at the host.  The  TYMCOM will
          receive data from the host on pin 3 (RD) which is connected to pin 2
          (TD) at the host.


               TYMCOM Operating as a DCE with an ASB211 Async ASCII Port               _________________________________________________________
                     Using an ASC140-20 Universal Cross-over Cable                     _____________________________________________

               TYMCOM                                          HOST               ______                                          ____

           Data Terminal Ready (20) ----------------> (8)  Data Carrier Detect
           Busy                (25) ----------------> (22) Ring Indicator
          *Ring Indicator      (22) <---------------- (25) Busy
          *Clear To Send       (5)  <---------------- (20) Data Terminal Ready
           Data Set Ready      (6)  <---------------- (20) Data Terminal Ready
           Data Carrier Detect (8)  <---------------- (20) Data Terminal Ready
           Transmit Data       (2)  ----------------> (3)  Receive Data
           Receive Data        (3)  <---------------- (2)  Transmit Data
           Signal Ground       (7)  <---------------> (7)  Signal Ground

                * Signal ignored by the Tymcom.


          For SIO ports operating  as a modem to the host,  the ASC117-1 cable
          must be  replaced with  a special  cable that  connects pin  4 (RTS,
          Request To Send) to pin 22 (RI),  since SIO generates a ring indica-
          tion on pin 4 (RTS) of the TYMCOM.


          Cable Option 2          ______________

          Cable option two is used for host ports that normally expect to com-
          municate with a terminal over a hardwired connection.  Note that the
          software is operating exactly as  described in the previous section;
          the only difference is in the cable.




                                                        INTRODUCTION    Page 5


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          In the second  configuration the TYMCOM will  ring a port,  but nor-
          mally the  host does not  use this  signal.  Instead, the  host will
          present continuous signals (DSR  and CD) whenever a  port is availa-
          ble.  The TYMCOM  will ring the host  on pin 25 (BUSY),  rather than
          pin 22 (RI),  since the cable is used in  multiple applications, and
          the host is not expected to look at RI at all.

          The TYMCOM will expect to see signals on  pin 6 (DSR) and pin 8 (CD)
          if the port is available.  The  TYMCOM will respond to these signals
          with pin  20 (DTR) when  a call is ready  for the port.   The TYMCOM
          will send data to the host on pin  2 (TD), and receive data from the
          host on pin 3 (RD).

          For asynchronous ports, this configuration  can be achieved by using
          the following cable:

               ASC117-1

          This cable is used as described in cable option one, but without the
          ASC140-20 adapter.

          For SIO ports operating with the host as a directly connected termi-
          nal, special  cables are not  required.  Standard 25  pin connectors
          are used.


          SECTION 1.3 Format          __________________

          There are a variety of options that may be specified when the TYMCOM
          is  generated.  In  most  cases if  an option  is  not specified,  a
          default value will be used.

          The ports on a  TYMCOM may be grouped so that more  than one host or
          subhost may be accessed using the same  TYMCOM.  When a user logs in
          through the  network, the  desired host is  determined by  using two
          criteria.   First, the  network  host number  given  with the  colon
          option is used (or the default, home host, if none was given).  Sec-
          ond, two characters of the  username (position determined by SINDXP)
          are examined to select the subhost.  (See the Glossary for an expla-
          nation of  the Subhost  Index.)  In the  TYMCOM, these  subhosts are
          referred to as subhost ordinals (SORDS) and the network host numbers
          are referred  to as hosts.   SORD numbers are  assigned sequentially
          from zero.  A host is a collection of one or more subprocesses which
          have SORD numbers that are in sequential order.

          The TYMCOM has four different levels  of options.  These levels are:
          global, host, subhost,  and port.  Global options  affect the entire
          TYMCOM.  Host options affect all  subhosts associated with a network
          host number.  Subhost  options affect only the  given subhost.  Port
          options may be specified individually for each port on the TYMCOM.






                                                        INTRODUCTION    Page 6


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          The order in which the different  levels of options are specified in
          the sysgen  directive file (Tymfile)  is significant.  If  a subhost
          option is  defined before the first  host is defined, it  applies to
          all  hosts and  subhosts (it  is global).   If a  subhost option  is
          defined immediately following  a host definition, it  applies to all
          subhosts of that host  only.  A subhost option  that appears immedi-
          ately following a subhost definition applies only to that subhost.

          Subhost options specified at the global or host level are overridden
          if another subhost option is specified at a lower level.


          SECTION 1.4 Syntax          __________________

          The parameters described in this manual  are all specified by state-
          ments of the form:

               SSSS(p1,p2,...,p10)

          where SSSS is the  name of the statement and p1  through p10 are the
          parameters for the statement.

          The name of  the statement may start  anywhere on a line.   The open
          parenthesis "(" must immediately follow the name.  Values p1 through
          p10 are separated by commas, and may not contain spaces except where
          spaces are  actually part of  the value  (as in message  text).  The
          close parenthesis ")" must follow the last statement parameter with-
          out any spaces.

          Statements may be separated from each other by any number of spaces,
          tabs, carriage returns,  or semicolons.  A comment  may be specified
          anywhere after the close parenthesis by preceding the comment with a
          colon and terminating it with a semicolon or carriage return.

          For statements with multiple  values, only ten values  may be speci-
          fied per statement, but statements may  be repeated as many times as
          necessary if more than ten values are needed.


          1.4.1 Message Text Syntax                ___________________

          Some of the  statements specify message text which  requires the use
          of hexadecimal numbers representing special characters.  All charac-
          ters for message text must be  specified, including any desired car-
          riage  returns and  linefeeds.  All  displayable characters  (except
          those  indicated below)  may  be specified  as  they would  normally
          appear.  The  maximum length is  157 characters,  including carriage
          returns.  All  characters  with  a hexadecimal  value  in  the range
          00 - 1F,  or 80 - 9F  must be immediately  preceded  by  a quotation
          mark in the message text (for example, "8D).  Three of the most com-
          mon of these characters and their hexadecimal values are:





                                                        INTRODUCTION    Page 7


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



               8D (or 0D)     carriage return
               8A (or 0A)     linefeed
               BB (or 3B)     semicolon

          A comma, an unmatched close parenthesis, a quote, or an accent grave
          (`), must be preceded by an accent grave.


          1.4.2 Parameter Value Syntax                ______________________

          Some parameter  values may  be specified  in ranges.   A range  must
          begin with the  lowest value and end with the  highest value.  These
          values must  be separated by  a hyphen  and no spaces  (for example,
          1-20).  Each  range will be treated  as one parameter field.   Up to
          ten ranges may be specified per statement.

          Parameters that specify ASCII characters will use hexadecimal values
          to  represent those  characters  in the  ranges  specified for  each
          option.

          A vertical  bar (|) represents a  choice in parameter  values.  Only
          one  of the  values may  be specified.   The vertical  bar is  never
          entered.

          SECTION 2.0 HARDWARE OPTIONS          ____________________________

          This section describes the global  statements detailing the hardware
          environment in which the TYMCOM is to operate.


          SECTION 2.1 Number of Async Logical Units (NALU)          ________________________________________________

          Syntax:  NALU(count)
          Default:  1
          Description:  This  statement specifies  the number  of asynchronous
               logical units (in  decimal) assigned to a TYMCOM  slot by ISIS.
               Each logical unit is 16 asynchronous ports.  The range of logi-
               cal units that may be specified is  from zero to eight, but the
               number cannot  exceed the number assigned  by ISIS or  the slot
               will be halted.

          Example:

               NALU(2)

               Assigns two logical units, or 32 ports.


          SECTION 2.2 Number of SIO Port Logical Units (NMLU)          ___________________________________________________

          Syntax:  NMLU(count)
          Default:  0
          Description:  This statement specifies the number  of SIO port logi-
               cal units  (in decimal) assigned to  a TYMCOM slot by  ISIS.  A
               logical unit is one port.

               Note:  SIO ports  always follow the normal  asynchronous ports.
               For  example, a  configuration  of  NALU(2)  and  NMLU(3)  will
               result in  ports 0 - 31   being normal asynchronous,  and ports
               32 - 34 being SIO, regardless of the order in which the logical
               units are defined.

          Example:

               NMLU(3)

               Specifies three SIO port logical units.

          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          SECTION 2.3 TYMNET Node Code Level (TYMNET)          ___________________________________________

          Syntax:  TYMNET(level)
          Default:  2
          Description:  This statement specifies the  level of the TYMNET node
               code running  in the machine.  A  1 is specified for  TYMNET I,
               and a 2 is specified for TYMNET II.

               TYMNET I  restricts the  TYMCOM in two  ways.  First,  only one
               network host number may be specified (defined by HST).  Second,
               the number of asynchronous ports  is restricted as follows.  If
               the TYMCOM is the only slot specified in the ISIS system gener-
               ation (in addition  to the slot 0 network  interface), then 128
               ports are available for host and TOM use.  If the TYMCOM is not
               the  only slot  specified in  the ISIS  system generation  (for
               example, if two or three slots are specified in addition to the
               slot 0 network interface), then 64 ports are available for host
               and TOM use.

          Example:

               TYMNET(2)

               Specifies TYMNET II node code is running in the machine.

               Note:  TYMNET II node code should be used for all new installa-
               tions.

          SECTION 3.0 TOM OPTIONS          _______________________

          This section describes  the Tymfile options defining  access limita-
          tions for  the TYMCOM  Operations Manager and  sets some  basic time
          definitions for the TOM (see the TOM User's Guide).                                           ________________


          SECTION 3.1 Number of TOM Users (MUTOM)          _______________________________________

          Syntax:  MUTOM(count)
          Default:  14
          Description:  This statement specifies the  number of TOM users that
               may be  logged in  to the  TOM  at any  one time  in the  range
               1 - 14.  This includes users  logging in from hardwired asynch-
               ronous terminals and users logging in through the network.

          Example:

               MUTOM(4)

               Allows up to four concurrent TOM users.


          SECTION 3.2 Number of Minutes Between Timestamp (TOMTR)          _______________________________________________________

          Syntax:  TOMTR(minutes)
          Default:  15
          Description:  This statement specifies the number of minutes between
               timestamps output to the TOM  console.  A timestamp consists of
               the date and time in the following format:

                    ddmmyy hh:mm:ss

               where ddmmyy is  the day, month, and year, and  hh:mm:ss is the
               hour, minute, and second.

               The value  for this statement  must be  in the range 1 - 59,652
               minutes.

          Example:

               TOMTR(60)

               Specifies 60 minutes between timestamps output  to the TOM con-
               sole.

          SECTION 3.3 TOM Time Zone (TOMTZ)          _________________________________

          Syntax:  TOMTZ(bias)
          Default:  0
          Description:  This statement  specifies the time zone (as  a bias to
               Greenwich Mean Time)  that should be used  for timestamp output
               to the  TOM console.  The bias  must be specified in  number of
               hours, preceded by a plus sign (+) or  no plus sign for a posi-
               tive number, or by  a minus sign (-) for a  negative number.  A
               positive number designates  a time differential for  a location
               East of  Greenwich, England.   A negative  number designates  a
               time differential  for a location  West of  Greenwich, England.
               This value may be changed while  the TYMCOM is running by using
               the TOM Zone command.

          Example:

               TOMTZ(-8)

               Sets TOM time zone to Pacific Standard Time.


          SECTION 3.4 NHA Message Repetition Rate (NHAMT)          _______________________________________________

          Syntax:  NHAMT(minutes)
          Default:  5
          Description:  This statement specifies the number of minutes between
               occurrences of the No Host  Acknowledgement (NHA) message being
               sent to  the TOM console.   This value may  be from one  to 546
               minutes.  The default message for the MTEXT(NHA) option message
               is:

                          HOST DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE USER DISCONNECT

               It may  be suppressed  or altered by  the MTEXT  statement (see
               Section 4.2),  and will  not be repeated  if the  RLSPT subhost
               option is set to  on (see Section 6.2.15).  If RLSPT  is set to
               off, the  message will  be repeated until  the port  is brought
               down by the TOM operator.

          Example:

               NHAMT(15)

               Specifies 15 minutes between NHA messages.

          SECTION 3.5 TOM Change License Password (TOMPW)          _______________________________________________

          Syntax:  TOMPW(password)
          Default:  Null (no password given with the TOM "GRAB" command)
          Description:   This statement  sets  the  initial password  for  TOM
               change license.  Up to seven characters may be specified in the
               password. The  password may not  contain any  carriage returns,
               spaces, question marks,  escape characters, or lower  case let-
               ters.  Refer  to the TOM User's  Guide for a definition  of the                                    _________________
               escape characters and the "GRAB" command.

          Example:

               TOMPW(LUCKY)

               Sets the initial password for change license to LUCKY.


          SECTION 3.6 TOM Command Level (TOMCL)          _____________________________________

          Syntax:  TOMCL(#,cm)
          Default:  See the TOM User's Guide                            ________________
          Description:  This statement is used to increase the level of a com-
               mand.  The value  "#" is the new  level; "cm" is the  first two
               characters  of  the  command  for which  the  level  change  is
               desired.

               Note:  TOM  commands are  divided into  three levels:   level 0
               commands are always accessible, level 1 commands are accessible
               after assuming change license via the Grab command, and level 2
               commands are only  accessible by logging in to the  TOM using a
               particular username and  assuming change license.  See  the TOM                                                                           ___
               User's Guide  for a description of  the initial level  for each               ____________
               command.

               Level 0 commands may be changed to level  1 or 2.  Level 1 com-
               mands may be changed to level  2 only.  Level 2 commands cannot
               be changed.

          Example:

               TOMCL(2,DO)

               Makes TOM Down command level 2 (allows only TOM Good Guy to use
               Down).

          SECTION 3.7 TOM Good Guy (TOMGG)          ________________________________

          Syntax:  TOMGG(username)
          Default:  !##TOM## (the username ##TOM## with shut override status)
          Description:  The TOM Good Guy statement is  used to change the spe-
               cial TOM username.   If the username has  SHUT override status,
               the name must be preceded by  an exclamation point.  The excla-
               mation point is not  part of the username, but is  added to the
               login data  by the  network Supervisor.   The username  may not
               contain any  carriage returns,  spaces, question  marks, escape
               characters, or lower case letters.

          Example:

               TOMGG(WINNER)

               Changes the special TOM username to WINNER.  This username does
               not have shut override status.

          SECTION 4.0 GLOBAL OPTIONS          __________________________

          This section describes the Tymfile options  which must be defined at
          the global level.  Subhost options may also be defined at the global
          level but are described at the  subhost level.  Refer to Section 1.3
          for an explanation of the ordering of options.


          SECTION 4.1 Port Number Radix (PNRADX)          ______________________________________

          Syntax:  PNRADX(DEC|OCT|HEX)
          Default:  Decimal
          Description:  This statement specifies the radix  in which port num-
               bers will be output  to a user's terminal.  The  choice of rad-
               ices is:   decimal, octal, or  hexadecimal.  It  is recommended
               that this option be left at the default.

          Example:

               PNRADX(OCT)

               Specifies the port number radix in octal.


          SECTION 4.2 Message Text (MTEXT)          ________________________________

          Syntax:  MTEXT(mname,mtext,position)
          Default:  The default for MTEXT is the  message text as shown in the
               second column of the following chart.

               mname     mtext                                     position               _____     _____                                     ________

          Description:  This statement defines the  text of messages generated
               by the TYMCOM.  The value for mname is one of the message names
               preceding the  default message  text.  The  entry for  mtext is
               text to substitute for the default message.  This must be spec-
               ified in the format described in  Section 1.4.1.  If no text is
               specified after  the message  name, the  message  will be  sup-
               pressed.  Some of  the message texts have  variable portions as
               noted in the default messages.   The decimal character position
               at which the  variable will be substituted is  specified by the
               position value  (position) as  shown in  the chart  above.  The
               first character of the message ("8D)  is defined as position 1.
               A value of zero specifies no substitution and is the default if
               position is  not specified  at all.   The number  of characters
               specified must be the same as shown for the substitutable char-
               acters illustrated in the default messages.

          Examples:

               MTEXT(RNA,"8D"8APORT nnn NOT RESPONDING,8)

               Changes the  "RING NO ANSWER ON PORT nnn"  message to "PORT nnn
               NOT RESPONDING", with "nnn" replaced by a port number.

               MTEXT(LOFF)

               Supresses the disconnecting message.

          SECTION 4.3 Project Code Accounting (PCODE)          ___________________________________________

          Syntax:  PCODE(character1,...,character10)
          Default:  No project code is sent to the accounting data base
          Description:  This statement  specifies a list of  8 bit termination
               characters for the login string.  If PCODE is specified without
               any termination character, the username,  the password termina-
               tion character,  and any  following characters  entered by  the
               user (up  to a maximum  of 12 characters)  will be sent  to the
               accounting data base.  If  termination characters are specified
               following the  PCODE statement, the  accounting data  base will
               receive the  username, password terminator, and  any characters
               preceding the  project code terminator (up  to a maximum  of 12
               characters).  The  project code  termination character  must be
               specified in hexadecimal.  A range of  characters may be speci-
               fied by entering  the beginning and ending  hexadecimal numbers
               separated by a  hyphen.  It may also be necessary  to specify a
               character by more than  one hexadecimal number so  that charac-
               ters from  various terminal types  can be  identified correctly
               (for example, a carriage return could be specified as 0D and 8D
               to account for either possible parity bit setting).

          Example:

               PCODE(8D,0D)

               Collects the project code until a  carriage return or a maximum
               of 12 characters have been reached.

          SECTION 5.0 HOST OPTIONS          ________________________

          This section describes  the Tymfile options which may  be defined at
          the host level.   This level defines a host number  and the position
          of the  characters in the  username that will  be used as  a subhost
          index.

          Note:  If the  TYMCOM is to  run on a TYMNET  I node, only  one host
               declaration is  allowed.  This requires  at least  two subhosts
               (TOM and  any customer  hosts), and requires  all but  the last
               subhost to have a subhost index specified.


          SECTION 5.1 Host Number (HST)          _____________________________

          Syntax:  HST(number)
          Default:  None - This option must be specified.
          Description:  This statement specifies a network host number in dec-
               imal.  Each network host on the TYMCOM must be specified.

          Example:

               HST(321)

               Specifies host number 321.


          SECTION 5.2 Subhost Index Starting Position (SINDXP)          ____________________________________________________

          Syntax:  SINDXP(position)
          Default:  1
          Description:  This statement specifies the  starting position of the
               two character subhost index in the username.  A negative number
               indicates the count for the starting position is the count from
               the end of the username.  The starting  position will be a sin-
               gle decimal number starting with 1  if counting from the begin-
               ning of the  username, and -2 if  counting from the end  of the
               username.  SINDXP can be specified at the global or host level,
               but never at the subhost level.

               Note:  The  shut override  character (!)  is not  counted as  a
               character in the username.

          Example:

               SINDXP(-2)

               The subhost index is the last two characters of the username.

          SECTION 6.0 SUBHOST OPTIONS          ___________________________

          This section describes the Tymfile options  that may be specified at
          the subhost  level.  All of the  statements except SHST may  also be
          specified  at  the global  or  host  levels.   This set  of  options
          includes four  groups of  options:  the  switch options,  the single
          value options, the multiple value options, and the variable multiple
          value options.


          SECTION 6.1 Subhost Definition (SHST)          _____________________________________

          Syntax:  SHST(gggg,x0,...,x9)
          Default:  No greeting message will be sent to the user, and the host
               will only have one, unindexed subhost
          Description:  This statement  defines the host greeting,  the number
               of subhosts per network host,  and the two character identifier
               for each of the subhosts.  One  subhost per network host number
               may have  a null identifier.  If  this subhost is  defined, any
               usernames that do not contain  a valid two character identifier
               will be  assigned to  ports associated  with this  subhost.  If
               this is the only subhost defined  for this network host number,
               all  users that  specify this  network  host at  login will  be
               assigned to this subhost.

               The first subhost of the first host is always used for the TOM.
               To disallow access to the TOM  subhost through the network, the
               TOM subhost  should be  declared with a  statement of  the form
               SHST(TOM,"01"01).  The  "01"01 declares  the hexadecimal  value
               0101 (Control A, Control A) as  the TOM subhost index.  Control
               A, Control A is not valid  in a username; therefore, no network
               logins can occur.

               The parameter "gggg" specifies a  four character greeting to be
               used in the  MTEXT(GRT) message "gggg IS ON  LINE" (see Section
               4.2).  This message is sent to  the user's terminal when he has
               successfully logged in if the MTEXT  parameter GRT has not been
               suppressed.  The greeting will be  left justified unless blanks
               are included  in the  statement.  The greeting  is not  sent if
               this parameter is not specified, but  the comma must remain for
               the subhost index to be specified.

               The parameter, "x0,...,x9", specifies the two character subhost
               indexes to be extracted from the username to address this host.
               Up to  ten indexes may be  specified.  If these  parameters are
               omitted, the  subhost must be  the last  one for this  host and
               will be the only unindexed subhost.









                                                    SUBHOST OPTIONS    Page 19


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          Example:

               SHST(HSTA,AA,AB)

               Users whose subhost index is AA or  AB will be assigned to this
               subhost and the subhost greeting sent to the user will be "HSTA
               IS ON LINE".


          SECTION 6.2 Switch Options (SOPT)          _________________________________

          Syntax:  SOPT(option1,...,option10)
          Default:  Not specifying SOPT has the same defaults as specified for
               each SOPT option
          Description:  This statement defines the  switch options allowed for
               a subhost.   If an option  is preceded by  a minus sign,  it is
               turned off.   A switch option may  be specified at  the global,
               HST or subhost levels.  If a switch  option has been set at the
               global or HST level, and the user wishes to turn it off for one
               subhost, the option must be specifed as off immediately follow-
               ing the  SHST statement to  be effected (or  HST if no  SHST is
               specified).

          Example:

               SOPT(GUNAM,-ECHO)

               Give the username to the host  and turn off the network echoing
               of characters.


          The following sections describe the subhost options and the defaults
          that will be used if they are not specified.


          6.2.1 Character Echo (ECHO)                _____________________

          Syntax:  ECHO
          Default:  On
          Description:  When  set to  on, the  network will  provide character
               echoing.  If  set to  off (-ECHO), the  user's terminal  or the
               customer's host is responsible for echoing all characters.  Off
               is not the usually recommended setting  as the user will not be
               aware of transmission  errors caused by telephone  lines if the
               terminal is echoing,  and if the host is echoing,  a delay will
               be experienced in character echoing.

          6.2.2 Echo of Linefeed (ELFCR)                ________________________

          Syntax:  ELFCR
          Default:  On (ignored if ECHO is off)
          Description:  When  set to on,  this parameter specifies  a linefeed
               from  the  terminal will  be  echoed  as a  linefeed,  carriage
               return, and  rubout.  This parameter  only applies if  the ECHO
               switch is on.


          6.2.3 Echo of Carriage Return (ECRLF)                _______________________________

          Syntax:  ECRLF
          Default:  On (ignored if ECHO is off)
          Description:  When  set to on,  this parameter specifies  a carriage
               return from the  terminal will echo as a carriage  return and a
               linefeed.  This  parameter only applies  if the ECHO  switch is
               on.


          6.2.4 Echo of Control I (ECTLI)                _________________________

          Syntax:  ECTLI
          Default:  Off (ignored if ECHO is off)
          Description:  When set to  on, this parameter specifies  that a Con-
               trol I  (tab) from the  terminal will  be echoed by  the TYMSAT
               instead of  putting the TYMSAT into  deferred echo mode.   A 09
               (Control I)  should also be  specified with the  DEMEC multiple
               variable statement if this parameter is specified as on.


          6.2.5 Echo of Control H (ECTLH)                _________________________

          Syntax:  ECTLH
          Default:  Off (ignored if ECHO is off)
          Description:  When set to  on, this parameter specifies  that a Con-
               trol H (backspace) will be echoed by the TYMSAT instead of put-
               ting the  TYMSAT into  deferred echo  mode.  A  08 (Control  H)
               should also be specified for the DEMEC multiple variable state-
               ment if this parameter is specified as on.


          6.2.6 Carriage Return Delay (CRDLY)                _____________________________

          Syntax:  CRDLY
          Default:  On
          Description:  When set  to on, this parameter  specifies that delays
               will occur after a carriage return.  If set to Off, delays will
               occur before a linefeed.  The default for this option is recom-
               mended.

          6.2.7 Echo Half Duplex (LCTLH)                ________________________

          Syntax:  LCTLH
          Default:  Off
          Description:  When set  to on, this parameter enables  the ELFCR and
               ECRLF  options for  half  duplex  terminals.  Thus,  when  this
               option is on, network  echoing of all characters  except a car-
               riage return for a linefeed (if ELFCR is on), or a linefeed for
               a carriage return (if ECRLF is  on) is disabled for half duplex
               terminals.  When  this option  is off,  all network  echoing is                                                       ___
               disabled for half duplex terminals.   A half duplex terminal is
               specified by entering Control H during username entry at logon.


          6.2.8 Send Gobbler on Break (BKGOB)                _____________________________

          Syntax:  BKGOB
          Default:  Off
          Description:  When  set to  on, this parameter  specifies that  if a
               break is encountered from the  terminal, the TYMCOM will remove
               all characters currently in the network buffers which are wait-
               ing to print at the terminal.


          6.2.9 Disconnect on Break (BKDSC)                ___________________________

          Syntax:  BKDSC
          Default:  Off
          Description:  When set  to on, this parameter specifies  that if the
               user enters  a break at  the terminal, a  disconnecting message
               (as specified by the MTEXT(LOFF) parameter) will be sent to the
               terminal.  The  user will be  disconnected from the  TYMCOM and
               sent a "please log in:" prompt from the TYMSAT.


          6.2.10 TIC on Fixed Speed Ports (TICAP)                 ________________________________

          Syntax:  TICAP
          Default:  Off (TIC sent only to autospeed ports)
          Description:  When set to on, this parameter specifies that the Ter-
               minal  Identification Character  generated by  the STIC  option
               will be sent  to all ports, both autospeed and  fixed speed, on
               the  customer  host.  Port  speed  is  determined by  the  PSPD
               option.

          6.2.11 ISIS Needle Sent to Host (GINDL)                 ________________________________

          Syntax:  GINDL
          Default:  Off (no needle sent)
          Description:  When set to on, this parameter specifies that the TYM-
               COM will send  a copy of the  ISIS needle it encounters  at the
               start of  the user session to  the host.  Everything up  to but
               not including the username is sent.  These are sent to the host
               8 bits at a  time.  The PARITY statement has no  affect on this
               option.  This includes:

                    16 bit ISIS port number
                    16 bit length of remaining needle (including username)
                    32 bit invoice number
                    16 bit destination host number
                    16 bit originating node number
                    16 bit originating host number
                    16 bit originating port number
                    24 bit reserved field (for future expansion)
                    8 bit throughput class (gouging level)
                    16 bit dialect code
                    8 bit terminal identifier
                    8 bit size of username (including carriage return or
                    semicolon)


          6.2.12 Username Passed to Host (GUNAM)                 _______________________________

          Syntax:  GUNAM
          Default:  Off
          Description:   When set  to on,  this parameter  specifies that  the
               username entered  at the  TYMSAT will  be passed  to the  host,
               along with the  delimiter (carriage return or  semicolon).  The
               username may be preceded by a string specified using the LOGINS
               statement.


          6.2.13 Ring Toggle (RNGTG)                 ___________________

          Syntax:  RNGTG
          Default:  On
          Description:  When set to on, this parameter specifies that the ring
               should  be  toggled  every  half  second  until  the  port  has
               answered.  If this  is set to off, the ring  signal will remain
               high until the  port answers.  This parameter should  be set to
               off to be compatible with 103F modem protocol.

          6.2.14 Ring Drop (RNGDR)                 _________________

          Syntax:  RNGDR
          Default:  On
          Description:  When set to on, this parameter specifies that the ring
               should be dropped after the  port has answered.  This parameter
               should be  set to off to  be compatible with 103F  modem signal
               protocol.


          6.2.15 Release Port if Drop Not Acknowledged (RLSPT)                 _____________________________________________

          Syntax:  RLSPT
          Default:  On (releases port)
          Description:  When set  to on, this parameter specifies  that a port
               which has had its circuit dropped  from the network side (indi-
               cated by the  TYMCOM dropping signals on this  port), which has
               not received  any host acknowledgement  (indicated by  the host
               not dropping signals  on this port for  at least one  half sec-
               ond), may  be released after a  time interval set by  the HDROP
               option.  If it is  set to off, the port will  remain hung until
               it receives  a host response.   In either case,  the MTEXT(NHA)
               message will be sent to the TOM repeatedly, as specified by the
               NHAMT statement, for as long as the port is hung.


          6.2.16 Capitalize Output from Terminal (CAPFT)                 _______________________________________

          Syntax:  CAPFT
          Default:  Off (doesn't convert)
          Description:  When set  to on, this statement  specifies that output
               from a terminal to the host will be converted to uppercase.


          6.2.17 Capitalize Output from Host (CAPFH)                 ___________________________________

          Syntax:  CAPFH
          Default:  Off (doesn't convert)
          Description:  When set  to on, this statement  specifies that output
               from a host will be converted to upper case.


          6.2.18 Buffer Zap Messages (BZAPM)                 ___________________________

          Syntax:  BZAPM
          Default:  Off (no message sent)
          Description:  When set to on, this parameter specifies that if char-
               acters  are lost  in the  network  buffers for  a terminal  (in
               either  direction),  one  of  the  messages  specified  by  the
               MTEXT(BZFT) statement or the MTEXT(BZTT) statement will be sent
               to the terminal.

          SECTION 6.3 Single Value Options          ________________________________

          The following options may be specified at  the global, host, or sub-
          host levels.  They  have one parameter in addition  to the statement
          which must be specified to set the option.

          Note:  Character value parameters  may be specified as  "OFF" at the
               subhost level if  they have also been defined at  the global or
               host level.   The "OFF"  value should never  be used  except to
               override the value of a higher level.


          6.3.1 Parity Bit Value (PARITY)                _________________________

          Syntax:  PARITY(SAVE|SPACE|MARK|ODD|EVEN)
          Default:  SAVE
          Description:  This statement specifies what  the TYMCOM will do with
               the parity  bit before sending a  character to the  host.  Only
               one value may be specified.  The values are:

                    SAVE  -  leave as is
                    SPACE -  set to zero
                    MARK  -  set to one
                    ODD   -  set to ODD parity
                    EVEN  -  set to EVEN parity

          Example:

               PARITY(ODD)

               The TYMCOM will output ODD parity to the host.


          6.3.2 Delay after DTR Raised (DTRP)                _____________________________

          Syntax:  DTRP(seconds)
          Default:  1
          Description:  This  statement specifies  the number  of seconds  the
               TYMCOM should wait  after setting DTR high  before sending data
               to the host, in the range 0 - 255 seconds.

          Example:

               DTRP(4)

               The TYMCOM will wait 4 seconds before sending data to the host.

          6.3.3 Seconds to Ring Before Disconnect (RINGTO)                __________________________________________

          Syntax:  RINGTO(seconds)
          Default:  4
          Description:  This statement specifies the number of seconds to ring
               a  port before  disconnecting a  user  when the  host does  not
               answer the ring signal,  in the range 0 - 255  seconds.  If the
               host does not  answer the ring signal, the  RNA message (either
               the one specified, or  the default) will be sent  to the termi-
               nal.

          Example:

               RINGTO(7)

               The TYMCOM will ring a port for 7 seconds before disconnect.


          6.3.4 Host Drop Wait in Seconds (HDROP)                _________________________________

          Syntax:  HDROP(seconds)
          Default:  4
          Description:  This  statement specifies  the number  of seconds  the
               TYMCOM will wait for host acknowledgement  after a user discon-
               nect occurs  before releasing a  port for reassignment,  in the
               range  0 - 255 seconds.  Host acknowledgement  is indicated  by
               the host  dropping signals on this  port for at least  one half
               second.   If  the  specified number  of  seconds  pass  without
               acknowledgement, a message  is sent to the TOM and  the port is
               made available  for reassignment or  is hung (depending  on the
               SOPT(RLSPT) setting).  If the TOM  operator determines the port
               is  malfunctioning, the  port  can be  disabled  using the  TOM
               "DOWN" command.  If  the port is not released  or brought down,
               the operator  will be informed  repeatedly as specified  by the
               NHAMT statement.

          Example:

               HDROP(10))

               The TYMCOM will wait up to 10  seconds after attempting to dis-
               connect a port before sending a message  to the TOM and releas-
               ing the port (if RLSPT is on).


          6.3.5 Minutes of Inactivity Before Drop (INACT)                _________________________________________

          Syntax:  INACT(minutes)
          Default:  No hang
          Description:   This statement  specifies the  number  of minutes  of
               inactivity to occur before the user  will be sent a message and
               dropped.  Inactivity is defined as  no characters having passed
               through the TYMCOM  in either direction for a  port.  The range
               that may be specified in INACT is 0 - 255 minutes.


                                                    SUBHOST OPTIONS    Page 26


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          Example:

               INACT(20)

               The TYMCOM will drop a port that has had no traffic in the past
               20 minutes.


          6.3.6 Break Sent to Host (BKSND)                __________________________

          Syntax:  BKSND(count)
          Default:  0
          Description:  For  asynchronous ports, this statement  specifies the
               number of increments  of 83.3 milliseconds of break  to be sent
               to the host.  For SIO ports,  this statement specifies the num-
               ber of increments  of 25.0 milliseconds of break to  be sent to
               the host.  The range that may be  specified in BKSND is 0 - 255
               increments.

          Example:

               BKSND(3)

               Sends 250 milliseconds of break to the host (on an asynchronous
               port).


          6.3.7 End of Transmission Character (EOTC)                ____________________________________

          Syntax:  EOTC(character)
          Default:  None will be specified
          Description:  This statement specifies the end of transmission (EOT)
               character to be received from the  host by the TYMCOM before it
               will return  a green  ball to the  TYMSAT.  The  standard green
               ball logic which returns a green  ball after a one second pause
               in host  output will not  be disabled  for a session  until the
               host sends the first EOT character  for that session.  (See the
               Glossary  for an explanation of  Green  Ball Logic.)  The char-
               acter  must be specified  as a  hexadecimal value  in the range
               00 - 7F.  This option may be  turned off by specifying "OFF" if
               the statement was specified at a higher level.

          Example:

               EOTC(04)

               The host  can use an EOT  character (04) to control  the TYMCOM
               green ball logic.

          6.3.8 Host Transparency Mode (HETM)                _____________________________

          Syntax:  HETM(character)
          Default:  No character specified
          Description:  This  statement specifies  the character  sent by  the
               host to place the TYMCOM in transparency mode.  After receiving
               this character,  the TYMCOM  will pass  all characters  in both
               directions without inspection or modification  until the end of
               the session.  The transparency character must be specified as a
               hexadecimal  value in the range  00  - 7F.  This option  may be
               turned off by  specifying "OFF" if the  parameter was specified
               at a higher level.

          Example:

               HETM(0B)

               The TYMCOM  will enter  transparency mode  when a  VT character
               (0B) is received from the host.


          6.3.9 Terminal Transparency Mode (UETM)                _________________________________

          Syntax:  UETM(character)
          Default:  No character specified
          Description:  This  statement specifies the  character that  must be
               sent by the terminal to place  the TYMCOM in transparency mode.
               After receiving this character, the TYMCOM  will pass all char-
               acters without inspection or modification  until the end of the
               session.  The  transparency character  must be  specified as  a
               hexadecimal value  in the range  00  - 7F.  This option  may be
               turned off by  specifying "OFF" if the  parameter was specified
               at a higher level.

          Example:

               UETM(0C)

               The  TYMCOM will  enter  transparency mode  when  Control L  is
               entered at the terminal.


          6.3.10 Character Preceding Special Characters (CTLESC)                 _______________________________________________

          Syntax:  CTLESC(character)
          Default:  No character specified
          Description:  This statement specifies a character that must precede
               special characters to the TYMCOM from the host or from the TYM-
               COM to the host.  This character must be specified as a hexade-
               cimal value in  the range 00 -  7F.  This option may  be turned
               off by specifying "OFF" if the  parameter has been specified at
               a higher level.




                                                    SUBHOST OPTIONS    Page 28


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



               The characters that  will be preceded by  this escape character
               when sent  from the  TYMCOM to  the host  are as  specified by:
               XON, HOSTDE,  HOSTEC (acknowledgement characters  only), POLFLO
               (acknowledgement character only),  and T2741  (host initializa-
               tion character only).  See Sections 6.4.1, 6.4.4, 6.4.5, 6.4.3,
               and 6.4.7.  The characters that must  be preceded by this char-
               acter to  be recognized when sent  from the host to  the TYMCOM
               are as specified by:  EOTC,  HETM, RXON, POLFLO (poll character
               only), and HOSTEC  (on and off characters  only).  See Sections
               6.3.7, 6.3.8, 6.4.2, 6.4.3, and  6.4.5.  Any unrecognized char-
               acter following the escape character will be passed to the ter-
               minal after  stripping off  the escape  character.  The  escape
               character may be sent from the host  to the terminal by preced-
               ing it with an escape character.

               Note that for SIO ports, the use  of this option will cause the
               response time to an XOFF character  to be rather slow.  As many
               as 128 characters could be output at 9600 baud.

          Example:

               CTLESC(1B)

               The TYMCOM will  use an ESC character (1B)  for special control
               functions.


          6.3.11 Abnormal Disconnect Message Text (ABNDM)                 ________________________________________

          Syntax:  ABNDM(text)
          Default:  No message sent
          Description:  This statement  specifies the message text  to be sent
               to the host when a circuit is zapped by a source other than the
               host.  The text of the message  may be from  0 - 255 characters
               long and follows  the message text syntax  described in Section
               1.4.1.  A  null character in  the text  must be entered  as two
               null characters ("00"00).

          Example:

               ABNBM(DETACH)

               The message  "DETACH"  will be sent to the host  on an abnormal
               disconnect.

          6.3.12 Login String Sent to Host (LOGINS)                 __________________________________

          Syntax:  LOGINS(text)
          Default:  No message sent
          Description:  This statement specifies a string to be sent to a sub-
               host at  login.  The username typed  by the user at  login will
               immediately follow this string if  the SOPT(GUNAM) statement is
               specified (see Section 6.2.12).  The text of the message may be
               from 0 - 255 characters long and  follows the message text syn-
               tax described in  Section 1.4.1.  A null character  in the text
               must be entered as two null characters ("00"00).

          Example:

               LOGINS(LOGON )

               When a user logs  in, the message "LOGON " will  be sent to the
               host.  If the GUNAM option is also set to on, the username will
               be sent to the host immediately following this message.


          SECTION 6.4 Multiple Value Options          __________________________________

          The following  statements define  options which  have more  than one
          value that may be specified.  The  order in which the parameters are
          defined on a multiple value option cannot be changed.  These options
          may be specified at the global, host, or subhost level.

          Note:  Character values  may be  specified as  "OFF" at  the subhost
               level if  they have  also been  defined at  the global  or host
               level.  The "OFF" value should never be used except to override
               the character value of a higher level.


          6.4.1 Backpressure of Host Output (XON)                _________________________________

          Syntax:  XON(on_character,off_character)
          Default:  No XON = not enabled
                    No parameters = Control Q and Control S
          Description:  This statement specifies the X-on and X-off characters
               (in hexadecimal)  the TYMCOM  will use to  start and  stop host
               output.  If  this option  is selected,  the host  may run  at a
               higher baud rate than the  user's terminal will accept, without
               losing data.  The   characters  may be specified   in the range
               01 - 7F.  The  option may be turned off by  specifying "OFF" if
               the parameter has been specified at  a higher level.  These are
               not to be confused with characters  typed at a user's terminal.
               A terminal  user who  wishes to  control character  flow should
               specify a  Control R at  login, and  use the standard  X-on and
               X-off characters.

          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          Example:

               XON(0E,0F)

               The TYMCOM will use a SO character (0E) to turn on host output,
               and a SI character (0F) to turn it off.


          6.4.2 Backpressure of TYMCOM Output (RXON)                ____________________________________

          Syntax:  RXON(on_character,off_character)
          Default:  No RXON = not enabled
                    No parameters = Control Q and Control S
          Description:  This statement specifies the X-on and X-off characters
               (in hexadecimal) to be used to  start and stop TYMCOM output to
               the host.  This  allows the user's terminal to run  at a faster
               rate than the host.

               Any X-on  characters sent  after the first  X-on and  before an
               X-off will be passed to the terminal.  Any X-off sent after the
               first X-off and before an X-on will  also be passed to the ter-
               minal.  The characters  may be specified in the range  01 - 7F.
               The option may be turned off by  specifying "OFF" if the param-
               eter has been specified at a higher level.

          Example:

               RXON

               The TYMCOM will respond to a DC3 (13) to enable the TYMCOM out-
               put, and will respond to a DC1 (11) to halt it.


          6.4.3 Host Backpressure Using Polling (POLFLO)                ________________________________________

          Syntax:  POLFLO(poll_character, ack_character)
          Default:  No POLFLO = not enabled
                    No parameters = ENQ and ACK
          Description:  This  statement specifies that host  backpressure will
               be controlled by  a special protocol in which the  host sends a
               polling character periodically, and stops  output to the TYMCOM
               until an acknowledgement character is received from the TYMCOM.
               The characters must  be specified as hexadecimal  values in the
               range  01  - 7F.  This option  may be turned off  by specifying
               "OFF" if the parameter has been specified at a higher level.

          Example:

               POLFLO(05,15)

               The TYMCOM will expect an  ENQ (05) as a polling character from
               the host, and will use a NAK (15) as an acknowledgement.

          6.4.4 Host Deferred Echo Mode (HOSTDE)                ________________________________

          Syntax:  HOSTDE(ede character,lde character)
          Default:  No deferred echo characters sent to host
          Description:   This statement  specifies the  characters the  TYMCOM
               will send to  the host when the leave deferred  echo mode (LDE)
               and  enter  deferred  echo  mode  (EDE)  network  commands  are
               received from the  TYMSAT.  These characters must  be specified
               as hexadecimal values in the range  01 - 7F.  The option may be
               turned off by specifying "OFF" if the parameter has been speci-
               fied at a higher level.

          Example:

               HOSTDE(02,03)

               The TYMCOM will send an  STX (02) for enter deferred echo mode,
               and an ETX (03) for leave deferred echo mode.


          6.4.5 Host Control of Echo (HOSTEC)                _____________________________

          Syntax:  HOSTEC(neonc,neoffc,neona,neoffa)
          Default:  No network echo mode characters  will be expected from the
               customer host by the TYMCOM
          Description:   This statement  specifies the  characters a  customer
               host may send to turn echo on  and off in the network.  Charac-
               ters the TYMCOM  will send to acknowledge  these characters may
               also be specified,  provided the host supports  an acknowledge-
               ment facility, to let the host  know exactly when the state was
               changed.  The characters must be  specified as hexadecimal val-
               ues in  the range  01 - 7F.   The option may  be turned  off by
               specifying  "OFF" if  the  parameter has  been  specified at  a
               higher level.

          Example:

               HOSTEC(12,14)

               The host can  turn network echo off by sending  a DC4 character
               (14) to the  TYMCOM, and can turn  it back on by  sending a DC2
               character (12)  to the  TYMCOM.  No  acknowledgement characters
               will be sent to the host.

          Example:

               HOSTEC(1C,1D,1E,1F)

               The echo off character is GS (1D)  and the echo on character is
               FS (1C).   The TYMCOM will acknowledge  an echo off  command by
               sending a US (1F), and will acknowledge an echo on command with
               a RS (1E).

          6.4.6 Terminal Control of Echo (TERMEC)                _________________________________

          Syntax:  TERMEC(neonc, neoffc)
          Default:  The terminal cannot control network echo
          Description:  This statement specifies the characters a terminal may
               send to  turn echo on and  off in the network.   The characters
               will be sent  on to the host  unless they are specified  in the
               FLTRFT statement (Section 6.5.3).  The characters must be spec-
               ified  as hexadecimal values  in the range 01 - 7F.  The option
               may be turned off by specifying "OFF" if the parameter has been
               specified at a higher level.

          Example:

               TERMEC(1E,12)

               The terminal can turn network echo off by sending a DC2 charac-
               ter (12),  and can turn  it back on  by sending a  RS character
               (1E).


          6.4.7 2741 Transparency Mode (T2741)                ______________________________

          Syntax:  T2741(tic,hic)
          Default:  No T2741 = not transparent
                    No parameters = transparent
          Description:  If the  TYMSAT is not translating  2741 communications
               to the  host it is  said to  be operating in  transparent mode.
               This statement specifies whether or not  the TYMSAT will trans-
               late a 2741  device's communication to ASCII  before passing it
               to the host. If set to  transparent, this statement also speci-
               fies characters  that the  TYMCOM will  send to  initialize the
               2741 terminal and the host.   The terminal initialization char-
               acter (TIC) and the host initialization character (HIC) must be
               specified  as hexadecimal values  in the  range 01 - 0FF.  Both
               TIC and HIC need not be  specified; either one may be specified
               singly if only  one is desired.  This option may  be turned off
               by specifying  "OFF" if the parameter  has been specified  at a
               higher level.

          Example:

               T2741(0FC,0B4)

               The TYMCOM will  put 2741's into transparent mode,  send an EOT
               (0FC) to the terminal, and an EOA (0B4) to the host.


          SECTION 6.5 Variable Multiple Value Options          ___________________________________________

          The following Tymfile options may be  specified at the global, host,
          or subhost levels.  Each statement  has multiple possible parameters
          which may be specified and do not have to be specified in a specific
          sequence unless otherwise noted.

          6.5.1 User Disconnect Characters (UDCHAR)                ___________________________________

          Syntax:  UDCHAR(character1,...,character10)
          Default:  No character specified
          Description:  This statement  specifies the user  disconnect charac-
               ters which, when entered  at a terminal, will  cause a "discon-
               necting" message (specified with  the MTEXT(LOFF) parameter) to
               be sent  to the  terminal and the  terminal to  be disconnected
               from the  TYMCOM.  The  MTEXT(LOFF) parameter  can be  found in
               Section 4.2 This is  useful for the user on a  host that cannot
               disconnect a  terminal.  The  characters must  be specified  as
               hexadecimal values  in  the range 00 - 7F.  The  option  may be
               turned off by specifying "OFF" if the parameter has been speci-
               fied at a  higher level.  These characters may  be specified in
               ranges as well as individually.

          Example:

               UDCHAR(1A)

               The TYMCOM will  disconnect the terminal when the  user types a
               Control Z character (1A).


          6.5.2 Characters That Initiate Gobblers (GOBBLE)                __________________________________________

          Syntax:  GOBBLE(character1,...,character10)
          Default:  No gobblers will occur
          Description:  This  statement specifies characters which,  when sent
               by the user,  will clear all characters which  are currently in
               network buffers waiting to be sent to the user's terminal.  The
               character is  also sent  to the  host unless  specified in  the
               FLTRFT statement (see  Section 6.5.3).  The characters  must be
               specified as  hexadecimal  values  in the range  00  - 7F.  The
               option may be  turned off by specifying "OFF"  if the parameter
               has been specified at a higher  level.  These characters may be
               specified in ranges as well as individually.

          Example:

               GOBBLE(03,1F)

               The TYMCOM will clear terminal output whenever the user types a
               Control C (03) or a Control O (1F).

          6.5.3 Characters Filtered from Terminal (FLTRFT)                __________________________________________

          Syntax:  FLTRFT(character1,...,character10)
          Default:  No characters will be filtered
          Description:  This statement specifies the characters to be filtered
               by the TYMCOM and  not allowed to reach the  host.  The charac-
               ters  must be  specified  as hexadecimal  values  in the  range
               00 - 7F.   This  option  may  be  specifically  turned  off  by
               specifying "OFF".  The parameters may be specified in ranges as
               well as individually.

          Example:

               FLTRFT(0-7,0B-0C,0E-1F,7F)

               The TYMCOM  will filter out  RUBOUT and all  control characters
               typed by the  user except carriage return  (0D), linefeed (0A),
               horizontal tab (09), and backspace (08).


          6.5.4 Characters Filtered from Host (FLTRFH)                ______________________________________

          Syntax:  FLTRFH(character1,...,character10)
          Default:  No characters will be filtered
          Description:  This statement specifies the characters to be filtered
               by the TYMCOM and not allowed to reach the user's terminal from
               the host.   These characters must  be specified  as hexadecimal
               values in the range 00 - 7F.   This option may be turned off by
               specifying  "OFF" if  the  parameter has  been  specified at  a
               higher level.   The parameters  may be  specified in  ranges as
               well as individually.

          Example:

               FLTRFH(1B)

               The TYMCOM will filter out any  escape (1B) characters the host
               sends.


          6.5.5 Characters to Echo in Deferred Echo Mode (DEMEC)                ________________________________________________

          Syntax:  DEMEC(character1,...,character10)
          Default:  0A, 0D, 20-7D (all  displayed characters + carriage return
               and linefeed)
          Description:   This statement  specifies the  characters the  TYMCOM
               will echo when in deferred echo mode.  These characters must be
               specified  as  hexadecimal values  in the  range  00 - 7F.  The
               parameters may be specified in ranges as well as individually.

          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          Example:

               DEMEC(08-0A,0D,20-7D)

               This is the same as the  default except that backspace (08) and
               horizontal tab (09) will also be echoed.


          6.5.6 Terminal Identification Characters (STIC)                _________________________________________

          Syntax:  STIC(type1,...,typen,tic,type,tic,...)
          Default:  No characters will be sent to the subhost
          Description:   This statement  defines  the terminal  identification
               character or character  pair that will identify  terminal types
               to the customer host.  The terminal types must immediately pre-
               cede the terminal  identification character to be  specified by
               that character.   These characters must  be specified  by their
               hexadecimal values in the range 01 - 0FFFF.  When one character
               is sent, then a zero character should precede it.  The terminal
               types are as follows:

                    Type   TIC     Speed                    ____   ___     _____

          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



               Terminal types may be specified  individually or in ranges.  If
               terminal type numbers  11 and 13 fall within  a specified range
               they will be ignored.  If they are specified individually, they
               will result  in an  error message.  If  the parameter  has been
               specified at a  higher level, this option may be  turned off by
               specifying the number "00" in the TIC field following the types
               that are to be disabled, for example, STIC(type1,type2,00).

               Note that the TIC will only be  sent to autospeed ports for the
               specified  subhost, unless  the switch  option  TICAP has  been
               turned on.  If TICAP has been set on, the TIC will also be sent
               to fixed speed ports on the subhost.

          Example:

               STIC(T10,418D,T1-T4,428D,T0,T12,8D,T16,438D)

               Send an "A" and CR for 110 baud terminals, a "B" and CR for 300
               baud terminals, send  only a CR for 1200 baud  terminals, and a
               "C" and CR for 2400 baud terminals.


          6.5.7 Login from Node Not Allowed (BARNOD)                ____________________________________

          Syntax:  BARNOD(node1,...,node10)
          Default:  All nodes allowed
          Description:  This statement  specifies a list of  nodes (octal node
               numbers) from which  logins to the defined subhost  will not be
               allowed.  Any valid node number or  list of node numbers may be
               specified.  This statement  and the OKNODE statement  are mutu-
               ally exclusive for the same subhost.

          Example:

               BARNOD(2030,2033,2166)

               The TYMCOM will not allow logins from nodes 2030, 2033, 2166.


          6.5.8 Login from Node Allowed (OKNODE)                ________________________________

          Syntax:  OKNODE(node1,...,node10)
          Default:  All nodes allowed
          Description:  This statement  specifies a list of  nodes (octal node
               numbers)  from  which  logins  to a  defined  subhost  will  be
               allowed.  No other nodes will be  allowed.  Any valid node num-
               ber or list  of node numbers may be  specified.  This statement
               and the  BARNOD statement are  mutually exclusive for  the same
               subhost.

          SECTION 7.0 PORT OPTIONS          ________________________

          This section contains  a description of the port  options.  With the
          exception of the PN  option, the port options may  be specified any-
          where in the Tymfile.


          SECTION 7.1 Port Numbers (PN)          _____________________________

          Syntax:  PN(port1,port2,...,port10)
          Default:  No ports assigned to a subhost
          Description:  This statement  defines the port numbers  (in decimal)
               which are assigned to a subhost.   Up to 10 single port numbers
               and/or ranges of port numbers may  be specified for each state-
               ment.  Port numbers  may be assigned from 0  to whatever number
               of ports  has been  assigned to the  slot.  Ports  are numbered
               sequentially starting from  zero.  These are logical  port num-
               bers.  Their relationship to the  physical port numbers associ-
               ated with the hardware depends on the ISIS configuration.  Each
               asynchronous logical unit is 16 ports and each SIO logical unit
               is one port.   SIO ports always follow  the asynchronous ports.
               (See  NALU  and NMLU,  Sections  2.1  and 2.2,  for  additional
               information on hardware options.)

               PN must be specified at the subhost level.

               Ports may be changed or assigned dynamically when the TYMCOM is
               running by using  the TOM "ASSIGN" command.   The ports defined
               for the TOM subhost are used  as the hardwired asynchronous TOM
               ports.  As many hardwired ports as desired may be assigned, but
               the MUTOM option will determine the maximum number of terminals
               that can be connected to the TOM at any one time.

          Syntax:  PSPD(speed,port1,...,port10)
          Default:  SF for all unmentioned ports
          Description:  This  statement specifies  the speed  at which  a port
               will communicate with a host.  The speeds are:

                     SF       Variable                    8          RS-232

               SF allows  the port to  run at  the speeds associated  with the
               terminal types specified by the PTYP option.  In this case, the
               STIC option  specifies the characters  to send to  the customer
               host for  each terminal type.   Port values  (p1 - p10)  may be
               specified individually  or in ranges.   This statement  must be
               repeated for each speed.

               A port defined as SF, whether  by default or by specifying this
               statement, is called an autospeed port.   A fixed speed port is
               one  which has  one  of  the  speeds   in  the  range  S0 - S12
               explicitly specified.

               For SIO  ports, the baud rate  is determined by  the thumbwheel
               switch on  the interface  card.  Use  of this  statement serves
               only to indicate  a fixed port (and whether a  Baudot port) and
               to document the proper thumbwheel setting.

               Port speeds  can be  changed dynamically  with the  TOM "SPEED"
               command.

          Examples:

               PSPD(S5,1-20)

               Ports 1 - 20 will communicate with the host at 1200 baud.

               PSPD(SF,21-31,46-47)

               Ports 21 - 31 and 46 - 47 will do speed matching and send TIC.


          SECTION 7.4 Port Candidate Type (PCAN)          ______________________________________

          Syntax:  PCAN(type,port1,...,port10)
          Default:  IFUP for all unmentioned ports
          Description:  This statement specifies the port candidate type.  The
               port type may  be SIG, for signal candidate type,  or IFUP, for
               "ifup" candidate types.   The types may be  changed dynamically
               with the TOM "CANDIDATE" command.

               The TYMCOM can determine whether or not a port is available for
               assignment (that is,  if it is "up") using one  of two methods.
               The first method (SIG) is the  signal candidate method.  If DSR
               and CD (DTR from the host) are usually held high by the host on
               an active port,  the TYMCOM can use these  signals to determine
               if the  port is available.  If  host signals only come  high in
               response to a  ring signal from the TYMCOM, a  TOM command must
               have declared a port  up for the TYMCOM to recognize  it as up.
               In this case, the "ifup" method must be used.

               Ports are candidates for assignment  if they have been declared
               UP with the TOM "UP" command.  They are no longer candidates if
               they have been declared DOWN with  the TOM "DOWN" command.  All
               ports are considered UP when the TYMCOM is initialized.

          Example:

               PCAN(SIG,1-31)

               Ports 1 - 31 will use the signal candidate method.

                                        GLOSSARY


          Deferred Echo Mode          __________________

          If the  switch option  ECHO is  set on,  characters sent  by a  full
          duplex terminal are echoed by the  TYMSAT.  However, when the TYMSAT
          receives a character it cannot echo (such as a character that is not
          a carriage  return, a linefeed, or  a printable character),  or when
          the host is  outputting to the terminal, the  TYMSAT enters deferred
          echo mode.   While the  TYMSAT is in  deferred echo  mode, character
          echoing is  provided by  the host  or the  TYMCOM, depending  on the
          value of the  HOSTDE statement.  Deferred echo  mode continues until
          the TYMSAT sends a  green ball (see Green Ball Logic)  to the TYMCOM
          and receives a return green ball in acknowledgement.


          EIA RS-232          __________

          The Electonics  Industry Association publishes standards  for signal
          protocol.  The TYMCOM utilizes a subset  of these standards known as
          EIA RS-232C.


          Green Ball Logic          ________________

          The TYMSAT stops echoing characters from the terminal when it enters
          deferred echo mode.  When the TYMSAT is ready to leave deferred echo
          mode and  resume echoing characters,  it sends  a green ball  to the
          TYMCOM.  The TYMCOM returns a green ball to the TYMSAT as soon as it
          receives an end  of transmission character (EOTC) from  the host, or
          when it detects  a one second pause  in host output (if  EOTC is not
          defined).  This assures  that the host has caught up  with the input
          character stream and has echoed all echoable characters.  The TYMSAT
          usually leaves deferred  echo mode as soon as the  return green ball
          is received, although the return green  ball may be cancelled by the
          TYMSAT if deferred  echo mode should continue (for  example, if more
          unechoed characters  have been  sent in the  meantime).  A  red ball
          from the  TYMSAT to the  TYMCOM cancels  the return green  ball, and
          causes deferred echo mode to continue.


          ISIS Needle          ___________

          The dispatcher in the ISIS node in  which a TYMCOM is running gener-
          ates an ISIS needle  whenever a new circuit is built  to the TYMCOM.
          The needle contains information about  the origin and destination of
          the circuit which is used by the  TYMCOM to complete the building of
          the circuit.  If the information is also required by the destination
          host, the TYMCOM switch option GINDL (set to on) will cause the TYM-
          COM to forward a copy of the needle  to the host when the circuit to
          the host is built.




                                                           GLOSSARY    Page 49


          ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM Reference Manual            January 4, 1983



          Subhost Index          _____________

          A subhost  index is a  two character  string imbedded in  a username
          that determines the  subhost the user will access.   The position of
          the index within a  username is determined by the value  of the host
          option SINDXP.  The subhost referenced by a subhost index is defined
          by the subhost option SHST.


          Transparency Mode          _________________

          In transparency mode,  the TYMCOM does not  inspect, filter, modify,
          or translate to ASCII any characters sent  on a circuit between ter-
          minal and host.  This mode allows for the transmission of characters
          that would otherwise be interpreted by the TYMCOM as having specific
          meaning.  Once invoked, transparency mode continues until the end of
          the session.

          The value of the statement T2741 determines  whether or not the TYM-
          SAT will handle translation of characters  sent from a 2741 terminal
          to a host, to ASCII.  If no translation is being done, the TYMSAT is
          in transparency mode.
