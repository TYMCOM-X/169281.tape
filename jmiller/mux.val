Subj:   Access to a MUX Host

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Don,

Steve Williamson, Key Logic, our VM Support contact would like to
be validated on a MUX host. He said six years ago they use to be
valid on host 1597.  The reason for wanting to be on a Mux host is
because they will be working with multiple userids on multiple
hosts: 40 43 47.  Also would you know what the mux switch character
is? Steve remembers it to be the accent graph (`). Can you provide
him with the answer?

Steve and company is in the process of doing IBM VM maintenance. The
sooner he gets access to a mux host, the better the job is for him.

The userids he is requesting a mux validation are:

STEVEW       Steve Williamson
KDANA        Kevin Dana
LTFLYNN      Terry Flynn

Do these names sound familiar to you. They were the orginal VM Support
people during Tymshare.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call. I can be reached
at x2556.

Thank you, Jan.
