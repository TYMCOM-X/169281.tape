Carol,

I saw the request to cancel VH1 and I processed your request. User was
canceled 05-10-89.

Costcode Changes: its a rather delicate situation which could get ruff.
First, you must send an ontyme to ACS - Terry Fujimoto and Cyntha Shen
regarding your intentions to transfer users from RCS to ACS. You'll
need to wait one to two weeks for a reply. (They may dispute your 
actions). Second, remember that I can only do costcode changes month
end. Third, if ACS does not want the users, we will have to decide what
to do with them. And last, (or should this be first) do wear your 
'Joan of Arc' outfit when you get ready to send the ontymes to us.
(Just kidding)!

CSCHROED: I've changed the username to RCS today 05-11-89. I hope you
remembered her password. If not, I think you can change it. If not, 
I'll change it for you.

GFD Access: What kind of errors do you get when you try to access your
clients directories?

CRAM:  All programs should be on all pdp10's. If not, we got a problem
because we no longer have a pdp10 support group.

Your just a busy lady these days. We'll both need a vacation after this
request is completed.

Best regards, Jan.
