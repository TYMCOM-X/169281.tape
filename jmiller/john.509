John,

I talked to Stephanie Hamik, and she told me to tell you to
contact either Bob McCormick, NSCMS.R/MCCORMICK, or Keith Curtis,
NSCMS.K/CURTIS, or Jeff Oliveto, NSCMS.J/OLIVETO, regarding access
to PTT Service.

They are always on the run, so your best bet would be to send them
an ontyme or leave an urgent telephone message.

Sorry for steering you in the wrong direction. I hope all goes well
with Supranational.

Best regards,
Jan
