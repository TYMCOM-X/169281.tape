Cynthia,

Several requests from International is requesting SETOP validations.

Because we did not give our Customers enough time to respond to the
new SETOP requirements, can you please expedite their requests asap.
They have been without Customer Service to their Customers ALL WEEK,
due to SUSPENDED license.

Your immediate reponse to their ontyme is greatly appreciated by
me and our International affiliates.

Thank you,
Jan
