Abdul,

I've set up special FDR's that need to be run prior to the shutdown
of system 45 and 87.

The FDR's are: FDRNPAC1, FDRNPAC2, FDRNPAC3, FDRNPAC4, FDRNPAC5,
               FDRNPAC6 and FDRNPAC7.

DEMAND in job FDRNPAC1. FDRNPAC1 will run first and then trigger
the rest in sequence. For example: FDRNPAC1 will trigger FDRNPAC2,
FDRNPAC2 will then trigger FDRNPAC3, FDRNPAC3 will then trigger
FDRNPAC4, etc...  Run FSTRUC to see the flow of the FDRNPAC's.

This is a 'one time' run, due to the relocation of Dev 438 thru 43F.

If you have any questions, call me at home at (408)984-6939.


Thank you and good luck, 
Jan
