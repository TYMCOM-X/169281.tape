Subj:  Oper password change

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Franco,

You will need a valid userid on D34 to be able to change your OPER
status password.

Once you are logged onto D34, at the exec, simply type R OPPS. This
command allows you to run the oper password change program.

        Example:   -R OPPS
                   ENTER YOUR NAME:  franco
                   ENTER OLD PASSWORD:  feb 1988
                   ENTER NEW PASSWORD:  mar 1988
                   TYPE IT AGAIN:  mar 1988

If you do not have a userid valid on 34, let me know and I will setup an
id for you. Please send userid/accounting information too.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best regards,
Jan
