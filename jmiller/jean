Subj:   RF License restored to TNSAMS


-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Jean,

An updated version of SETOP was installed Monday, February 6th. The new
SETOP requires 'security information' such as ISG Employee Number, 
Employee name, address, telephone, Manager name, Employee username,
Department number and a reason for needing PDP license.

Without this information, Users were suspended from their license. IPC
was not given enough time to contact our users of the change.

I am sorry for the inconvenience due upon you and your Customers. This
catastrophe could have been avoided if we were given enough time to alert
the users.

At this writing, TNSAMS has been restored to RF license. Since you do not
carry and ISG Employee Number, I've had to give you a fictitious number.
I need however, the following security information:  Employee name, 
address, telephone, Manager name, and Department Number and a short reason
for needing RF license. right now I have used YOU for the Employee and
Manager name. If this is incorrect, please corret me.

I want to be honest with you, since the updated installation, there has 
been unforseen BUGS in the program. If you can not access your license on
desired PDP systems, please let me know immediately.


Thank you and best regards,
Jan
