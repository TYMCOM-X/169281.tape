SUBJECT:  CONCORD 296 DIAL-UP ASYNC MODEM STRAPPING AND 4-WIRE LL


	CONCORD 296 V.32 MODEM STRAPPING GUIDE

There is presently two types of Concord 296 modems being used in the
Tymnet network. The first , the white box and the newer , Grey box.
The White box is described first and the newer Grey box is second.

	STRAPPING FOR ASYNC DIAL-UP ANSWER MODE (White Box)

   At the back of the modem you will find 8 postion dip switch located
to the right of the power switch. Up is OFF and Down is ON for this switch.
The switch is labeled A and should be set as follows:


	SWA-1   OFF	Positions 1 & 2 set the DTE port baud
        SWA-2   ON 	rate to 9600bps
        SWA-3   OFF	2 wire Dial-up
     	SWA-4 	OFF	Command Mode enabled
	SWA-5	ON	DCD, DSR, & CTS follow modem, Hang-up on falling DTR
	SWA-6	OFF	Enables Front Panel Switches
	SWA-7	OFF	Write Protect Disabled
	SWA-8	OFF	Enables Concord Data CMD Set

   A four position switch labled B which is to the left of the DTE connector
is set as follows:

        SWB-1   OFF	Disables positive test voltage on pin 9 of the DTE
			connector.
	SWB-2 	OFF	Disables negative test voltage on pin 10 of the DTE
			connector.
	SWB-3	OFF	Data signaling rate selector, DTE is source.
	SWB-4	OFF	DTE can busy modem with a +5 volts on pin 25.


   A two position switch labled C selects 2 or 4 wire line and the type
of termination. Set position 1 for 2 wire dial-up and position 2 for the
type of data jack installed on the line.

	>>>>>>>Softstraps for both modems are the same<<<<<<<

   After setting the dip switches connect a 9600 baud terminal to the DTE
port to program the software straps. With the modem powered up press the
return key twice .At  the  "CDS >" prompt type RESET.The modem will ask
"ARE YOU SURE ? [Y OR N]. Type a Y. This will reset the modem to the
factory default settings.

   Now enter the command RSF at the CDS > prompt. RSF is short for Review
Setting - Full list. The following display should appear on your screen:

CDS >

   After the full display you should have another CDS > prompt. Enter the
following commands at the prompt terminating each command with a carriage
return.

   SLCD4
   SPF1
   SBK5
   SMF0
   SLT0
   STI0
   SRP MDCTYMNET
   SAVE
   INIT

At the CDS> prompt enter SRM2.After you enter the carraige return you
will not see any response.Type "SAVE" return, and "INIT" and return.
This will disable sending the Concord banner to the consat.
Type RSF and return and check to make sure the softstraps are set
correctely. SRM0 will give you the echo back is you need it .


   You are now finished strapping the modem. Connect the engine's SIO ASYNC
port to the DTE port on the modem. Be sure the baud rate of the SIO port is
set for 9600. Connect the dial-up phone line to the DIAL jack on the back of
the modem and power on the modem if it is not already.

   After setting the dip switches connect a 9600 baud terminal to the 
DTE port to program the softstraps. With the modem powered up press the
return key twice. At the CDS> prompt type RESET <cr>. The modem will ask
you "ARE YOU SURE ? [Y or N]" type YES<cr>. 
  At the CDS> prompt enter the following softstraps terminating each 
command with a <cr>.
