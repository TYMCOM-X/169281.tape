The PREV-SCREEN, NEXT-SCREEN, and PRINT-SCREEN keys all work while inside of
Kermit.  Also, the commands "Control-\", "C", "SET LOG PRN", "CONTINUE" should
work.  If this doesn't hack it, give me a call.    /Joe

I learned to drive, and to hate state police in the home of fascism,
New Jersey.  The only purpose in life for a NJ trooper was to harass
the poor motorist.  If you broke down, the troopers might condescend
to calling a tow truck, if they saw you, and you couldn't refuse the
tow either.

Today, whilst accelerating from 40 MPH on an on ramp to southbound
101, my poor, little, abused Honda decided to call it quits (timing
chain).  And so, I coasted to a very thin shoulder and hit my hazards.

About 25 minutes later, a CHP pulled up behind me and gave me a push
to the nearest gas station (!!), where my friend had gone to call AAA.
Had this been New Jersey, I would have spent the entire night waiting
for a tow truck.  I am very glad I was spared that doom, and I am
very grateful to the CHP for their help.

This is information that I picked up on another area.  It was
never posted here, and may not be appropriate, but it seemed
important.  
What follows is an exerpt of what was in the original article
the only thing eliminated was an invitation to a graduation
exercise that was held last month.  All the rest should be
current.  See end of article for original poster.



Bay Area Model Mugging (BAMM) is a non-profit organization.

Information: Bay Area Model Mugging, 3410 Devon Way, Redwood City, CA 94061              (415) 342-2266

>From various Model Mugging brochures:
The National Crime Prevention Council defines sexual assault as "any
uninvited or unwelcome touching or talking about the private parts of
you body". While many rape crisis centers estimate that one in every
three women in the US will be sexually assaulted during their lifetimes,
other organizations quote the figure at one in five or one in ten.
Model Mugging gives a women an alternative to being submissive when attacked.

What Is It?
Model Mugging is a highly specialized training system that teaches
women a knockout defense against an assailant of any size. The course is 
unique in its use of a specially trained, heavily armored assaiant - 
typically a black belt martial artist.

In simulated rape scenarios, this assailant, the Model Mugger, relentlessly
attacks each student until she delivers a "knockout" blow (a blow which would
render unconscious anyonne not protected by the Mugger's special gear.)
Students don't merely practice techniques; they are trained to use real, 
full-force defenses against the padded assailants.  For most woemn, this is the
first all-out, no-holds barred fight of their lives.

The most important thing in life is to love someone. The second
most important thing in life is to have someone love you. The
third most important thing is to have the first two happen at the
same time.                       - Howie Schneider

[Sometimes firms will hire such groups to come teach employees techniques.
If you're interested, you might ask.]

In the beginning was the demo project.
And the project was without form.
And darkness was upon the staff members thereof.
So they spake unto their division head saying,
"It is a crock of shit, and it stinks."

And the division head spake unto his department head, saying:
"It is a crock of excrement and none may abide by the oder thereof."
Now, the department head spake unto his directorate head, saying:
"It is a container of excrement and is very strong, such that none
may abide before it."

And it came to pass that the directorate head spake unto the
assistant technical director, saying:
"It containeth that which aids growth and is very strong."
And Lo, the technical director spake then unto the captain, saying:
"The powerful new project will help promote the growth of laboratories."

And the captain looked down upon the project and he was that it was good.

Sirs,

     I've decided to apply for your position as a systems
programmer even though I hate snow worse than I hate snakes.
     I've been training for going on two years now at a local
community college in data processing, computers, and that sort of
stuff and have probably learned all about MVS/SP, JES2, ACF/VTAM,
NCP, CICS, IDMS and a bunch of other letters you didn't even list
(In fact, there's about 26 of them total)!
     I feel that this qualifies me in that respect.  As for IBM
systems, I have an IBM Selectric and even and IBM wall clock at
which my current boss says I watch better than anyone else here.
You list Assembly but that seems like a typo to me because that
is a hardware thing, nothing real programmers are supposed to do.
However, if you will train me I will even buy my own tools
provided you don't let any other real programmers see me doing
it.
     I see that you list competitive salary but if the best you
can do is to compete with my current salary I don't think I can
afford the job.  I thought programmers made lots of money.  But
I'm easy.  We can talk about that later.
     Please note that I've included my phone number and address
but if you like you can just have my ticket waiting at the
airport if that's more convenient.  Alaska Airlines first class
will be good enough.
     By the way, just what does a system programmer do?  (You can
save that for the interview if you like.)
     I'm glad to see you're an equal opportunity employer.  My
boss says you would need to be to hire an "obnoxious bastard"
like me.  Is that a protected group?
     Well, act quick 'cause I'm going fast.

                              Sincerely,

                              Poindexter D. Bytechip

Best when told with a heavy Italian accent when the father speaks.


   An Italian boy has a life long dream to go to school in the United
States and it finally comes true (good thing for this joke) when he is
accepted to Columbia University in New York.  After a couple of years
at school his father comes to visit him in America.  The boy is
very excited to see his father and ask what he would like to do in 
America.  The father says, "This is'a America. I'd a like'a to go'a to
a baseball game."  So they head on down to Yankee stadium and as it
turns out it's oldtimers day.  Roger Maris comes to bat and hits a 
long ball which is heading for the left field seats.  The father stands
up and yells, "RUN'A ROGER, RUN".  Micky Mantle comes up next and hits
a fly ball to deep right field.  Again, the father stands up, and yells
"RUN'A MICKEY, RUN".  Next Joe Dimagio steps out to the plate.  There
pitcher throws ball one, ball two, ball three and walks him on four
pitches.  As Joe Dimagio starts to trot to first base the father stands
up and shouts, "RUN'A JOE, RUN".  "No", his son interrupts, "He has
four balls, he walks".  His father stand up again, "walk'a proud, Joe,
walk'a proud."

Q. Which stretches the farthest? Skin or Rubber.

A. Acording to the Bible it would be skin. It says: "Then Aron

Has anyone had any bad experiences with Visions cookware from Corning?

I was intent on buying a set until a friend of mine mentioned that
they are difficult to clean.  It seems that they have these slightly
raised bumps at the bottom of their pans--  a "waffle"-like pattern.
The manufacturers say that this pattern helps the oil lubricate the
underside of the food better.  My friend says that these bumps also
make it difficult to clean.  Small bits of food get stuck between
the bumps.  He says you have to have a keen eye and a willingness
to scrub accurately between the bumps if you want clean cookware.

I have seen very handsome chopsticks in a store called "Earthworks"
at the San Antonio shopping center.  These chopsticks are made of
carved cherry wood (I think).  They sell for about $10/pair and have
matching chopstick rests.

Even though I've been tempted to buy these chopsticks as gifts, I
wonder:  after a year or so of use, are they going to hold up to
food/washing, etc.?  Anybody know?

ALL BANKS STINK! OK, now that I got that out of the way lets think about the
bank issue from the average user's point of view: Seems that everybody has
at least one complaint about a bank they are or were using. In contrast most
people also have a "great" story about one or more banks. SO you can't really
believe what you hear. I'll tell you a story about how bad Wells Fargo is and
the guy next to me will say: "Gee, I've used them for 5 years with no problems."
Sure...!!!!!!!!!

SO I made my decision the following way: If I'm going to get screwed (the
assumption of using a bank), I might as well go with the one that offeres
me the largest variety of services. Since most banks now charge a service 
fee, that point became quite moot. After all, I am not going to loose sleep
over an extra $12/year. I picked B of A (I use their computer Home Banking
not available from any other bank). They offer the 24 hour phone service,
one of the largest ATM networks, toooooo many branches, and a good deal
of choices for different checking services.

And here is a switch: I went into a branch the other day to check on some
trivial item (I usually do not go into the branch but use the ATM almost
ALWAYS..solves service problems alot!). I started a discussion with the new 
accounts rep and when I was done they had cut $72/year service charges off
my account ($6/month) and ADDED interest paying to my regular checking. In
addition, I no longer need to carry a B of A Visa to get check guarantee
now so I save another $18/year. Thats $90 total AND I get interest. So I had
to ask...OK, whats the catch? Nothing really changed with my account and your
giving me near $100 a year. Why? The answer is "Aplha". B of A is pushing the
Aplha account very hard and are now including other types of accoutns into 
combined service mode so that getting "free" checking is easier. And despite
what the news media says, only one account of B of A's will be charging for
ATM use.

So to answer the first question, perhaps leaving  B of A is not the answer.
Perhaps you need a branch that makes a few less errors! May I suggest that
you try moving your account to another branch and see if you still have
the same problems. I may not be totally satisfied with any bank, but you
must admit, B of A is running scared right now and will probably do just about
anything to keep you happy. They did for me! :-)

(No, I have nothing to do with the bank thank you! )

I have no idea where this came from, it crossed my desk today, and I
thought y'all would enjoy it:

A Letter of Apology from a Chap who was Fired After a Christmas Party

Dear Friends:

When I came into the office this morning, I noticed a sort of general feeling 
of unfriendliness and since several of you have openly called me a dirty
son-of-a-bitch to my face, I know I must have done something wrong at our 
office party last Friday.  The Office Manager called me today from the 
hospital and so this is my last day.  I would like to take this way of 
apologizing to all of you.  I would prefer speaking to you personally, but
all of you seem to go deaf and dumb whenever I try to talk to you.

First, to our dear and beloved boss, Mr. Simons, I am sorry for all the 
things I called you Friday afternoon.  I am very much aware your father is
not a baboon, nor your mother a whore.  Your wife is a delightful woman and
my story of buying her for fifty cents in Tia Juana was a fragment of my
imagination.  Your children are undoubtedly yours too.  About the water cooler
incident, well, you will never know how badly I feel about it and I hope they
didn't hurt your head when they were trying to get the glass jug off.

To Miss Ashby, I express my deepest regrets.  In my own defense I must remind
you that you seemed to enjoy our little escapade on the stairs as much as I 
did until the bannister broke and we fell eight feet to the second floor 
landing.  In spite of the rupture you incurred when I landed on top of you.
I am sure you will admit that when we landed it was one of the biggest thrills
you have ever had.

Sam Franklin, you old cuss, you've just got to forgive me for that little   
prank I played on you.  If I had known you were goosey, I'd never have done 
it.  It could have been a lot worse if that fat lady had not been standing
right under the window you jumped through; she broke you fall a lot.  People
have been killed falling three stories.

Mr. Gray, I regret telling the firemen it was you who turned in the alarm, 
but of course, I had no way of knowing they would be such bad attitudes about
it.  Those fire hoses sure have a lot of pressure, don't they?

Bill Thomas, I know how you must have felt about me.  Opening the door to the
mop closet suddenly must have startled you and Miss Finch quite a bit and 
when I think of how hard you bumped your chin on the sink when your bent over
to pull up your pants, it makes me sick.  We'll have to get together for 
dinner some night after the dentist finishes your plate.

Miss Brown, the only excuse I can offer for stealing all of your clothes
and hiding them when I found you had passed out in the Ladies Room, was that
I was drunk.  Also, I want to know I was very embarrassed when I could not 
remember where I hid them and you had to go home in that sofa cover.  Running
your falsies up the flagpole was a bit too much I guess, but like I said, I 
was a little drunk.

To all the rest of you, I am sorry.  Setting Mrs. Botts' lace panties on 
fire seemed a funny idea at the time, and it makes me sad to hear that her 
husband is divorcing her because of it.  Pissing in everyone's drink was in
bad taste, too, and not telling until you all drank it was even worse.  Now
that I have apologized to all and know I am forgiven, I have a big surprise
for you.  Even though I don't work here anymore, I'm going to do my damndest
to get back to the office picnic on next Friday.

                              Regards, Stan

	Exactly : difficult to clean. I figure I used 3 times more water
(than cleaning regular pots and pans), and 3 times the time usually spent making
sure it is clean.

Yes, I agree with the problem of cleaning the pans.  My set has bumps only
in the frying pans, but they are difficult to get clean.

I originally bought them because I thought it would be easier to boil
things when I could see the liquid level through the side of the pan. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  I don't boil things dry anymore,
but even with liquid covering the food, I have scorched any number of
things.  I've used both inexpensive aluminum cookware, and Le Creuset, 
and never had as many problems with either of them.  I'm going back to
the Le Creuset.

It also bugs me that the handles of the Visions get hot.  Hot handles
is one of the things that caused me to put the Le Creuset in a box, but
since the Visions cooks so poorly, I'm going to make handle cozies for
my Le Creuset and start using it again.

Chaste gnats rusting honor orphan flier,
Chalk floss tripping archer knows,
You'll tight hair oils beamings hung bye acquire,
End fold stressed duplicate ski moles.

Heavy bought thee noisome turnkey handsome missile doe,
Kelp tomb ache a sneezing bite
Shiny dots wither ice hall igloo,
Oil fine guitar does leap tune right.

Eve springing slots off poison goatees sin hiss lay,
Anchovie murders piled dish gonner's pie,
Tootsie refrain dear eel lea knoll howl tough lie.

Ant sore rime orphaning disk pimple face,
Two kicks form wan tonight detour,
Alto hits bend shed, money dimes, money weighs
Mare eclipse mast too few.

Merry XMAS everyone. I took this off the net a few months ago, thought 
	people might enjoy reading it....


                     *-  CHRISTMAS SHOPPING: A SURVIVOR'S GUIDE -*

                                                  -By Dave Barry

          Once again,  we come  to the  Holiday Season, a deeply religious time
     that each of us observes, in  his own  way, by  going to  the mall  of his
     choice.

          In the old days, it was not called the Holiday Season; the Christians
     called it "Christmas" and went to church; the Jews called it "Hanukka" and
     went to  synagogue; the atheists went to parties and drank. People passing
     each  other  on  the  street  would  say  "Merry   Christmas!"  or  "Happy
     Hanukka!" or (to the atheists) "Look out for the wall!"

          These days,  people say  "Season's Greetings,"  which, when you think
     about it, means nothing. It's  like  walking  up  to  somebody  and saying
     "Appropriate Remark"  in a  loud, cheerful voice. But "Season's Greetings"
     is safer, because it does not refer to  any actual  religion. Some  day, I
     imagine, even  "Season's Greetings"  will be considered too religious, and
     we'll celebrate the Holiday Season by saying "Have a nice day."

          Some of you may be unhappy with this  dereligionizing of  the Holiday
     Season,  and  you  may  have  decided  that,  this  year,  you're going to
     celebrate it  the  old-fashioned  way,  with  your  family  sitting around
     stringing cranberries  and exchanging humble, handmade gifts, like on "The
     Waltons".

      Well,  you  can  forget   it.   If   everybody   pulled   that   kind  of
     subversive  stunt,  the  economy  would collapse overnight. The government
     would have to intervene:  It  would  form  a  cabinet-level  Department of
     Holiday  Gift-Giving,  which  would  spend  billions  and  billions of tax
     dollars to buy Barbie dolls and electronic games,  which it  would drop on
     the populace  from Air  Force jets, killing and maiming thousands. So, for
     the good of the nation, you should go along with the Holiday Program. This
     means you should get a large sum of money and go to a mall.

          Unless you  live in  Indonesia, there  should be several malls within
     five miles of your home. It makes no  difference whatsoever  which one you
     go to:  Under federal  law, all  malls in  the United States must have the
     same 42 chain stores. You have your chain bookstores, your  chain clothing
     stores,  your   chain  shoe  stores,  your  chain  restrooms,  your  chain
     electronic-game arcades.

          The basic idea behind  malls is  that they  are more  convenient than
     cities.  Cities  contain  streets,  which  are  dangerous  and crowded and
     difficult to park  in.  Malls,  on  the  other  hand,  have  parking lots,
     which are  also dangerous and crowded and difficult to park in, but - here
     is the big difference - in mall parking lots, THERE  ARE NO  RULES. You're
     allowed to do anything. You can drive as fast as you want in any direction
     you want. I was once driving in a mall parking lot when my car  was struck
     by a  pickup truck being driven backward by a squat man with a tattoo that
     said "Charlie" on his forearm, who got out and explained  to me,  in great
     detail, why  the accident  was my  fault, his  reasoning being that he was
     violent and muscular, whereas  I was  neither. This  kind of  reasoning is
     legally valid in mall parking lots.

          So when  you get  to the  mall for  your holiday  shopping, the first
     thing to remember is that you should not park in the parking  lot and walk
     to  the  mall  buildings,  because  you will probably get killed. Instead,
     drive your car  right  up  to  and,  if  possible,  right  into,  the mall
     building. This  is perfectly  legal; people  do it all the time. In almost
     every mall I've ever been  to,  the  corridors  were  littered  with cars,
     recreational vehicles, snowmobiles and motorboats left by smart parkers.

          Once you're  safely in  the mall, you should tie your children to you
     with ropes so the other shoppers won't try  to buy  them. Holiday shoppers
     have been  whipped into  a frenzy by months of holiday advertisements, and
     they will buy anything small enough to stuff into a shopping bag.  If your
     children object  to being  tied, threaten to take them to see Santa Claus;
     that ought to shut them up.

          Now you're ready for the actual shopping. Your goal should  be to get
     it over  with as  quickly as  possible, because the longer you stay in the
     mall, the longer your children will have to listen to holiday songs on the
     mall public-address  system, and  many of  these songs can damage children
     emotionally. For example: "Frosty the  Snowman"  is  about  a  snowman who
     befriends some  children, plays  with them  until they  learn to love him,
     then melts. And "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" is about a young reindeer
     who, because  of a  physical deformity,  is treated  as an  outcast by the
     other reindeer. Then along comes  good,  old  Santa.  Does  he  ignore the
     deformity? Does  he look  past Rudolph's  nose and respect Rudolph for the
     sensitive reindeer he is underneath? No. Santa asks  Rudolph to  guide his
     sleigh, as  if Rudolph  were nothing more than some kind of headlight with
     legs and a tail. So unless you want your children exposed to  this kind of
     insensitivity, you should shop quickly.

          Here is  a very efficient shopping method: Divide the amount of money
     you have  by the  number of  people on  your gift  list to  get an average
     dollar amount  per person.  So if you have $160, and you want to buy gifts
     for 10 people, your  average is  $16 per  person. Now  find something that
     costs $16,  and buy 10 of whatever it is. You'll find many useful gifts in
     this price range; for example, you  could get  10 family-sized  bottles of
     vitamin B.  Everyone, young  and old  alike, can  use vitamin  B, and your
     children are sure to shriek with delight when they find it under the tree.

          If you want to buy gifts that are a little more personal,  you should
     follow these guidelines:

                                  Gifts for Men

           Men are amused by almost any idiot thing -  that is why professional
     ice hockey is so popular  -  so buying  gifts for them is  easy.   But you
     should never  buy them  clothes.   Men believe  they already  have all the
     clothes they will ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  For example,
     your average man has 84 ties,  but he wears,  at most, only three of them.
     He has learned, through humiliating trial and error,  that if he wears any
     of the other 81 ties,  his wife will probably  laugh at  him  ("You're not
     going to wear THAT tie with that suit, are you?").   So he has narrowed it
     down to three safe ties,  and has gone several years without being laughed
     at. If you give him a new tie, he will pretend to like it, but deep inside
     he will hate you.

          If you  want to  give a man something practical, consider tires. More
     than once, I would have gladly traded all the gifts I got for a new set of
     tires.

                                 Gifts for Women

          Again, you  should avoid  buying clothes, but not because women don't
     like clothes. The problem is sizes. First of  all, women's  clothing sizes
     don't mean  anything. Suppose  you're looking at a dress, and the tag says
     it's a size 14. You could  measure that  dress with  every known measuring
     instrument, checking  for every  known unit  of measurement, and you would
     never find any dimension that was  14 anythings  long. Not  only that, but
     you would never find any dimension that corresponded to the same dimension
     on any other size-14 dress. Not only that, but chances are you would never
     find any woman in the entire world who would admit to being a size 14.

          Another problem  is color.  Women do  not see  color the  way men do.
     Suppose several women are in a paint store, looking at a sample  of orange
     paint.  The  paint-can  label  may  say "orange," and the paint may appear
     obviously orange to a male, but the women will never use the word "orange"
     to describe it.

         They will say things like:   "It has a lot of blue" or  "It's much too
     gray." Don't ask me to explain it. All I know is, if  a woman  tells a man
     she'd like  a green scarf for Christmas, he'll go out and buy a scarf that
     he believes to be green, based  on his  concept of  "green," which  he got
     from crayons in the second grade. She will look at the scarf as if it were
     covered with maggots, then show it to her friends and say: "I asked Harold
     for a  green scarf,  and just  look at what he got me." They'll all have a
     good laugh, and she'll return it.

          So the  safest  gifts  for  women  are  expensive  little  bottles of
     colorless liquids, which are sold at cosmetic counters under names such as
     "Eau de Water" and "Endless Night of Heavy Petting."

                                Gifts for Children

          This is easy. You never have to figure out what to get  for children,
     because they  will tell  you exactly what they want. They spend months and
     months researching these  kinds  of  things  by  watching Saturday-morning
     cartoon-show advertisements.  Make sure you get your children exactly what
     they  ask for,  even if you  disapprove of  their choices.   If your child
     thinks he wants  Murderous Bob,  the Doll with the  Face You Can Rip Right
     Off,  you had better get it.   You  may be  worried that it  might help to
     encourage your child's antisocial tendencies, but believe me, you have not
     seen antisocial tendencies until you've seen a child who is convinced that
     he or she did not get the right gift.

Before I bought an answering machine, I thought I didn't need one.  Then
I started thinking up possible messages, and before long I had bought an
answering machine just so I could put my messages on it.  Here they
are.  There are plenty of them...
=====================

This is not an answering machine--this is a telepathic thought-recording
device.  After the tone, think about your name, your reason for calling,
and a number where I can reach you, and I'll think about returning your
call.

Thanks for calling Dial-An-Asshole.  Right now, all our assholes are busy.
After the tone, leave your name and number, and we'll have an asshole
return your call as soon as possible.

I can't come to the phone now because alien beings are eating my brain.
Leave a message anyway, and after the alien beings assume my shape, one of
them will get back to you.

I can't come to the phone now because I have amnesia and I feel stupid
talking to people I don't remember.  I'd appreciate it if you could help
me out by leaving my name and telling me something about myself.  Thanks.

C'mon...you can do it...just a little one.  That's the way...just a little
beep, just a little one.  C'mon...good boy...here we go...like
this--beeeeep, just a little one, beeeeeeeeeep, c'mon...There you go!

Andy Warhol said that one day everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.
Well, your 15 minutes was last week, but since you weren't ready, we gave
it to Vanna White.  Sorry.

Thank you for calling the Confessional Hotline.  Father Durway's not here
right now, but if you'll leave your name, number, and confession at the
tone, he'll get back to you with absolution as soon as possible.  And
remember, confession doesn't count unless you confess all of your sins in
vivid, graphic detail!

I can't come to the phone right now because I'm down in the basement
printing up a fresh new batch of 20 dollar bills.  If you need any money,
or if you just want to check out my handiwork, please leave your name,
number, and how much cash you need after the tone.  If you're from the
Department of the Treasury, please ignore this message.

[VOICE 1]  Answer the phone, please, Hal.
[VOICE 2]  I'm sorry, Dave, I can't do that.

[For Shakespeare lovers only]
So long as phones can ring and eyes can see,
So leave a message, and I'll get back to thee.

Thanks for calling Dial-A-Shrink.  I can't come to the phone right now, so
after the tone, please leave your name and number, then talk briefly about
your childhood and tell me what comes to mind when you hear the following
words:  orange...mother...unicorn...penis.  I'll get back to you with my
diagnosis as soon as possible.

[Sung to the tune of "Ride of the Valkyries"]
Leave a message...leave a message....etc.

Next on Public Radio 91 we'll be hearing music of Antonin Dvorak.  This is
the Beep Serenade in C-Sharp Minor, Opus 72....

This is a test.  This is a test of the Answering Machine Broadcast System.
This is only a test.

No!  NO!  Not THAT!  Anything but that!  Not the beep!  No!  Please!  Not
the beep!  Anything but the beep!  AAAAIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEE!

You're growing tired.  Your eyelids are getting heavy.  You feel very
sleepy now.  You are gradually losing your willpower and your ability to
resist suggestions.  When you hear the tone you will feel helplessly
compelled to leave your name, number, and a message.

As the drugs take hold, you feel you are losing your grip on reality.  You
begin to hallucinate.  You see a telephone...the telephone is next to an
answering machine...you hear a faint click and a light flashes on the
answering machine...you hear a beep....

Prepare for alpha test of Beep Software revision 1.05.  Counting down to
test:  5...4...3...2...1...

After the tone, leave your name, number, and tell where you left the money.
I'll get back to you as soon as it's safe for you to come out of hiding.

Don't you do it!  Don't you dare!  I don't want to hear it!  Don't you
beep!  If you beep, I'll...don't even think about it!....Don't....!

I can't come to the phone now, so...hey--that's a nice phone you have
there.  Hey sugar, you call this number often?  I bet you have answering
machines bothering you all the time...yes indeedy.  Why don't you give me a
call sometime and we can listen to some old recordings...I might even play
my beep for you...

I can't come to the phone now, so if, well, actually, I CAN come to the
phone now, I mean, like, I'm at the phone NOW, recording this message, but
I'm doing this NOW, while you're listening to it LATER, except for you I
guess it's NOW, like, when you're listening to it...I mean, like, wait,
gosh.  This is so confusing.

How do you leave a message on this thing?  I can't understand the
instructions.  Hello.  Testing 1 2 3.  I wonder what happens if I touch
this...YOW!!

Thank you for calling the Metropolitan Church of the Holy Bible.  Today's
commandment is Number 6, Thou shalt not...er...bear a...er...shalt not
witness thy...uh...neighbor's ass, oh, I mean, false...er...shalt not
commit a bear...dern...

Hey.  Enjoy.

{ed This joke was placed in rot13 by the original poster.}

Boot camp. Duluth, Minnesota. February. Six A.M. Six below zero.

The Sergent bellows "Outta those bunks! Birthday suit inspection! I want you
(deleted) to fall in outside, NOW! Buck nekkid! Stand close enough to make the
man in front of you smile! MOVE, YOU #@$$&*s!"

The barracks quickly empty, the men fall in and shiver at attention.

The Sergent hollers "LOOSEN RANKS!"

The ranks separate a bit. The Captain approaches, carrying a swagger stick.
With the stick, he swats one of the men across the chest.

"Did that hurt, Mister?" the Captain demands.

"No, SIR!" the recruit shouts.

"Why not?" barks the Captain.

"Because I'm a U.S. Marine, SIR!"

The Captain nods, and moves on down the front rank a bit. He whacks another man
across the butt.

"Did that hurt, Mister?"

"No, SIR!"

"Why not?"

"Because I'm a U.S. Marine, SIR!"

Satisfied, the Captain continues on down the rank. He notices that one of the
men is sporting a huge erection, and brings his stick down sharply on the
proffered target.

"Did that hurt, Mister?"

"No, SIR!"

"Why not?"

"Because it belongs to the fellow behind me, SIR!"

(Heard this one from a minister at a pre-wedding party:)

A priest and a rabbi operated a church and a synagogue across the
street from each other.  Since their schedules intertwined, they
decided to go in together to buy a car.  So they did.  They drove it
home and parked it in the street between their establishments. 

A few minutes later, the rabbi looked out and saw the priest sprinkling
water on their new car.  It didn't need a wash, so he ran out and asked
the priest what he was doing.  "I'm blessing it" the priest replied.

The rabbi replied "Oh," then he ran back into the synagogue.  He
reappeared a few minutes later with a hack saw, ran to the car and cut
off the last 2 inches of the tailpipe.

DEAR SKI ADVISOR,
I consider myself a solid "advanced intermediate" skier,
and my ski length is 185.  But last Saturday I did a little
checking around and noticed that all the other guys have
200s or 205s.  Am I missing out?
				CONCERNED

DEAR CONCERNED:
Your anxiety about "not measuring up" is not uncommon among men.
The average male ski is around 190, so it sounds like you hang out
with a crowd that has some fairly impressive equipment.
But to put things in perspective, there is a wide range of
lengths to be found in the adult skier population, 
starting from 130 cm on the low end, and going up to 225,
with a few even longer than that.
And other cultures have rather different attitudes about their ski
length:  European men can often be found with shorter skis, 
especially when out looking for a little "off-piste" action.
(not to mention their new infatuation for the monoski).

The most important question to ask yourself is, 
"Am I enjoying skiing now?"  If you are, then forget about
meaningless comparisons with other skiers.  Remember 
someone will always be bigger or smaller than you --
so in the end all comparisons are frustrating.
Most people don't even notice ski size, and we think that
your preoccupation with it might even be limiting the pleasure
you're getting from your present skiing.
				THE SKI ADVISOR

A biologist, an engineer and a mathematician were crossing the
border into Scotland from England on a train when they saw a 
field with a black sheep in it.  The biologist said "look, in
Scotland the sheep are black".  The engineer replied "no, in
Scotland some of the sheep are black".  The mathematician rolled
his eyes to heaven and said, very patiently, "in Scotland, there
exists at least one field, in which there is at least one sheep
which is black on at least one side".

Dear Mr. Noah Tall,

    I need to type a report on "Farts and Farting."  What are the
standard names for the different classes of farts?

                                            Ima Wondring


Dear Ima,

    There is only one class of farts, but it is broken into several
genus-species categories.  The most common are listed and defined
below.  Enjoy!

    Percussicus simplizoan:  the common fart; a small sound and
slight odor...it presents no major problem in a well-ventilated room

    Anus ignitus:  the mexican food fart; often accompanied by
watery eyes and a lack of interest in sitting;  these can be detected
several feet away by sound and/or smell;  DO NOT EXPOSE TO OPEN
FLAMES!

    Humidimus fecium: wet farts;  the kind that happen all day when
you eat high fibre diets;  these are usually accompained by brown
stains and itching, wet buttocks...they don't go over well at small
parties, but in public swimming pools, they're untraceable

    Loyaltus befriendius:  the kind of fart that follows you around
wherever you go for the next half hour causing shortness of breath
of everyone within a 9 foot radius

    Nutronus ingestium: the farts that gag all the people but
leave the buildings standing;  it was the original inspiration
for both the neutron bomb and poison gas;  these can be tasted as
well as smelled and may cause skin and eye irratation

    Vaporous sinous: known as the "therapeutical fart," these
can clear sinus passages or strip paint from the walls; usually
emitted silently

                                  -Mr. Noah Tall
=====================================================================

Dear Mr. Noah Tall...
        Who invented Jello...?

                        Curious...?

Dear Curious,

    Jello was originally invented by the ancient Egyptians as a means
of preserving internal organs, food, pets, slaves and playthings for
the Pharoahs.  They believed that in the after-life, the pharoah would
rise from the dead and dig through the Jello until he found his
favorite fruit and then begin a 7 day feast.  This was known as "The
Great Feast of Molded Fruit" after the condition in which the fruit
would most likely be found.

    This tradition was passed on and changed many times from culture
to culture until it arrived here.  We still have molded fruit on
certain occasions today, but in better condition than that of our
ancestors...with the possible exception of bananas.  Again, we see
that the past is still the basis of the present.

                                       -Mr. Noah Tall

=======================================================================

Dear Mr. Noah Tall:
  A friend of mine told me that LISP is the best artificial
intelligence programming language.  Doeth that ekthplain why motht
thpeech thynthethizers talk funny?
                                   Cleft Lipp

Dear Mr. Lipp,
    Actually, there is a better reason for the odd sounding speech
from most speech synthesizers...THEY'RE STUPID!  Have you noticed
that they sound worse than (no offense intended) special education
students?  Keep in mind it is ARTIFICIAL intelligence, not to
be confused with that of the banana slug, which is far superior
(refer to AI periodicals).
    I personally am under the philosophy that banana slugs are the
new wave in high technology.  Why waste time and money (time IS
money) on multi-megabyte computers when you could have these
adorable little darlings calculating your financial records,
finite element analyses, and/or stress tests.
    Imagine the possibilities: slug workstations, slug mainframes,
all kinds of slug networks!!
    There would be a need for measures to prevent soboteurs from
taking salt into the labs.

                             -Mr. Noah Tall
========================================================================


On most stapler's I've seen, the little plate that bends the staple has
two settings.  Most ordinary mortals use the "together" setting.  What
the heck is the "apart" setting for?!?

        --Jon


Dear Jon, (yes, it's one of those letters)

    The "apart" setting was based on one of the Aborigine manhood
rituals.  A competitor would take his boomerangs(*) and try to
affix a written scroll to a designated tree.  To make this task easier,
the boomerangs were often sharpened on the ends or decorated with
sharp stones.  But, alas, this led to problems with the aerodynamics
of the the boomerang.

    Then one Aborigine, with the help of computer scientists, aerospace
engineers and a Cray XMP, designed the ultimate boomerang for this task.
Finite element analysis showed that the stapler in its "apart" setting
would maximize the ability of a normal Aborigine to staple the scroll
to the tree.  Now, staplers are, for convenience, made the same for sale
both here and abroad.

    I hope this will help put your mind at ease, just ignore the
"apart" setting while in our culture.

                                       -Mr. Noah Tall

(Borrowed shamelessly from a friend:)

Following the marginally successful Teacher In Space program, NASA decided
to send up some religious leaders.  So up go a priest and a rabbi on the
Atlantis.  After a few days in orbit they're back and in a news conference
they're asked how it was.

"It was simply magnificent!" exclaimed the priest "God's creation in its
full glory."

"And you, rabbi" asked one of the reporters.

"Oy, I tell you it vas just awful."

"Well, why?"

"You vouldn't believe it, every five minutes it's de same ting:  on vith the
 tfillin, off with the tfillin, on with the tfillin, off with the tfillin..."


(For those of you with puzzled looks:
Tfillin are sacred prayer scrolls in special leather holders. Each morning
Every Jewish man is supposed to put them on his forehead and arm as part of
morning prayer.)

(From "The Homebuilders", a tape on improving marital relationships:)

The local Kiwanis Club was meeting on Wednesday night, and the guest speaker
was to be a Sex Therapist speaking about Sexual Intimacy in Marriage.
Unfortunately, the speaker got snow-bound at a distant airport, and the local
Kiwanis leader asked a member who was a physician if he would fill in by
speaking on the same topic, which he did.

When the physician got home, his wife asked about the meeting, and he
explained that he had to fill in for the guest speaker.  "What was your speech
about?", she asked.  A bit embarrassed to admit the truth, he replied, "I
spoke on Sailing."

The next morning, the physician's wife was at the grocery store when she met
the wife of one of the other Kiwanis members who said, "My husband tells me
that your husband gave a wonderful and helpful speech last night!"
Thinking about what her husband had told her about his speech, the
physician's wife replied, "You know, it's funny, but I never thought of him as
an expert.  He's only done it twice.  The first time, his hat blew off, and
the second time he threw up and swore he would never do it again!"

The Court of King George III
London, England

July 10, 1776

Mr. Thomas Jefferson
c/o The Continental Congress
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. Jefferson:

We have read your "Declaration of Independence" with great interest.
Certainly, it represents a considerable undertaking, and many of your
statements do merit serious consideration.  Unfortunately, the Declaration
as a whole fails to meet recently adopted specifications for proposals to
the Crown, so we must return the document to you for further refinement.
The questions which follow might assist you in your process of revision:

1.  In your opening paragraph you use the phrase "the Laws of Nature and
    Nature's God."  What are these laws?  In what way are they the criteria
    on which you base your central arguments?  Please document with
    citations from the recent literature.

2.  In the same paragraph you refer to the "opinions of mankind."  Whose
    polling data are you using?  Without specific evidence, it seems to
    us the "opinions of mankind" are a matter of opinion.

3.  You hold certain truths to be "self-evident."  Could you please
    elaborate.  If they are as evident as you claim then it should not be
    difficult for you to locate the appropriate supporting statistics.

4.  "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" seem to be the goals of
    your proposal.  These are not measurable goals.  If you were to say that
    "among these is the ability to sustain an average life expectancy in
    six of the 13 colonies of at last 55 years, and to enable newspapers
    in the colonies to print news without outside interference, and to
    raise the average income of the colonists by 10 percent in the next
    10 years," these could be measurable goals.  Please clarify.

5.  You state that "Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
    these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,
    and to institute a new Government...."  Have you weighed this assertion
    against all the alternatives?  What are the trade-off considerations?

6.  Your description of the existing situation is quite extensive.  Such a
    long list of grievances should precede the statement of goals, not
    follow it.  Your problem statement needs improvement.

7.  Your strategy for achieving your goal is not developed at all.  You
    state that the colonies "ought to be Free and Independent States," and
    that they are "Absolved from All Allegiance to the British Crown."  Who
    or what must change to achieve this objective?  In what way must they
    change?  What specific steps will you take to overcome the resistance?
    How long will it take?  We have found that a little foresight in these
    areas helps to prevent careless errors later on.  How cost-effective are
    your strategies?

8.  Who among the list of signatories will be responsible for implementing
    your strategy?  Who conceived it?  Who provided the theoretical research?
    Who will constitute the advisory committee?  Please submit an organization
    chart and vitas of the principal investigators.

9.  You must include an evaluation design.  We have been requiring this
    since Queen Anne's War.

10. What impact will your problem have?  Your failure to include any
    assessment of this inspires little confidence in the long-range
    prospects of your undertaking.

11. Please submit a PERT diagram, an activity chart, itemized budget, and
    manpower utilization matrix.


We hope that these comments prove useful in revising your "Declaration of
Independence."  We welcome the submission of your revised proposal.  Our due
date for unsolicited proposals is July 31, 1776.  Ten copies with original
signatures will be required.


Sincerely,


Management Analyst to the British Crown

Along with no 3rd party standing to sue insurance companies, this is another
side effect the voting public were not aware of when they vote Bird and the
others out of the court. The high cost of the death penalty. Sigh.

     Some time ago in Scandinavia, there was a near disaster on the 
railways.  It seems that there was a long stretch of track on which
a Norwegian engineer was cruising his train on schedule.  However, there
was a drunken Swedish engineer who confused his schedule and in his
inebriated state, was piloting his train in the opposite direction
on the same stretch of track!  By the time the Norwegian engineer noticed
the imminent wreck, it was too late to stop.  But there was no wreck,
and both trains proceeded to their destinations, because ... Norse is
Norse, and souse is souse, and never the twains shall meet!

WHOSE JOB IS IT ?

This is a story about four people named Everybody, Somebody,
Anybody and Nobody. There was an important job to be done and
Everybody was asked to do it. Anybody could have done it but
Nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that because it was
Everybody's job. Everybody thought Anybody could do it but
Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn't do it. It ended up 
that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody
could have done.

Some folks missed the original post of Apple's letter concerning the
proposed anti-discount legislation aimed at universities that
participate in Apple's (and others') university consortium
selling/pricing schemes. As a favor to the net, here it is again:
 
(original post follows:)
.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an open letter I received (secondhand) from Apple Computer. It
regards a set of proposals floating around the House of
Representatives which affect the ability of college students to
purchase computers at university prices. (This, of course, refers to
all makes of computer equipment, not just the Apple stuff.) The
recipient and I felt this might be of interest. (I am not affiliated
with Apple, nor is this posted by their request or permission.)
.
The letter follows (verbatim):
.
To: College Faculty and Students
From: Apple Computer, Inc.
Re: Federal legislation to limit your ability to buy personal computers
on college campuses
.
As you know, Apple Computer and other computer manufacturers work with
colleges and universities to conduct a special program so that you can
buy personal computers for educational purposes at large discounts
from retail price. Some businesses who sell our products at higher
prices, however, are complaining to the federal government about the
discounts made available to you through your university or college.
They would prefer you to buy computers from them at higher retail
prices. Because the Congress has been hearing only from these
businessesmen [sic] and not from the students and faculty, the
politicians are now considering ways to restrict you in the college
and university community from purchasing computers at education
prices.
.
The current proposals being considered would do the following:
.
     (1) prevent students from buying computers at education prices
from your campus reseller unless they get a permission slip from a
professor which states that the computer is required for a particular
class; and
.
     (2) prevent college faculty and staff from purchasing computers
through the campus resale program at education prices altogether.
.
Is it fair that only students who take specific classes be able to buy
computers inexpensively? Should adults be required to get a permission
slip in order to buy a computer? Will faculty members be equally
enthusiastic in using computers for class projects if their right to
buy computers on campus is taken away? At Apple, we believe the answer
to these questions is an emphatic NO. Computers are an educational
tool that you can use for many different productive and creative
purposes. Do you need a permission slip to buy a textbook, a
calculator or a typewriter? No. Then why should you need one to buy a
computer?
.
If you feel as strongly as we do that limiting the sale of computers
to college students, faculty and staff is bad public policy, you need
to let the men and women in Congress know. Your letters will have an
impact. If a Congressman gets letters from you and your colleagues or
fellow students, he will have to think twice about limiting your right
to buy computers. The follwing Congressman [sic] in the House of
Representatives are the most active on the subject:
.
     J. J. Pickle (D-TX)
     Beryl F. Anthony, Jr. (D-AR)
     Ronnie G. Flippo (D-AL)
     Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND)
     Harold E. Ford (D-TN)
     Charles B. Rangel (D-NY)
     Andrew Jacobs. Jr. (D-IN)
.
     Richard T. Schulze (R-PA)
     Raymond J. McGrath (R-NY)
     Rod Chandler (R-WA)
     E. Clay Shaw, Jr. (R-FL)
.
Please write to them at U.S. House of Representatives, Washington,
D.C. 20515. They are all members of the subcommittee which is
deliberating on this subject, the Oversight Subcommittee of the House
Ways and Means Committee. This subcommittee may make a legislative
recommendation on it very soon.
.
Since Apple is opposing this legislation, we can best coordinate our
efforts with you if you send us a copy of your letters to these
government officials. Please send the copies to:

     Washington, D.C. 20005
.
If you have any questions on this issue, you can call Mr. Jacob at
