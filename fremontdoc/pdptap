<TITO WAS DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE AN IMPROVED UTILITY FOR MAGNETIC
TAPE WORK ON THE <TYMCOM-X SYSTEMS. <TITO CAN READ <TEX FORMAT TAPES BUT IT
MAY HAVE TROUBLE READING THE OLDER '<FAILSA' FORMAT (<FAILSAFE IS DOCUMENTED ELSEWHERE).
<TITO CANNOT PERFORM ANY 'MAGNETIC TAPE CONVERSION' FUNCTIONS NOR HANDLE 
TAPES FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BUT THE <TYMCOM-X SYSTEMS.
.PARA
^IN ADDITION, <TITO ALLOWS THE OPERATOR TO VERIFY THAT CHECKSUMS AGREE -
A CERTAIN METHOD OF ASSURING THAT NONE OF THE FILE HAS CHANGED DURING
THE TRANSFER TO OR FROM TAPE. <TITO ALLOWS STORING OF A FILE ACROSS THE
PHYSICAL TAPE BOUNDARY AND HAS THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE A TAPE JOB
ON A DIFFERENT TAPE DEVICE THAN THE ONE INITIALLY ASSIGNED TO THE JOB.
^IT ALLOWS MORE SELECTIVITY IN DETERMINING WHICH FILES WILL BE
OPERATED UPON FOR SELECTED COMMANDS, AND HOW MUCH DETAIL TO TYPE OUT ON
THE OPERATOR'S TERMINAL FOR TAPE TO DISK AND DISK TO TAPE PROCEDURES.
<TITO IS BETTER ABLE TO RECOVER
FROM CERTAIN COMMON TAPE FORMAT ERRORS THAN EARLIER TAPE UTILITIES.
^FINALLY, THE PROGRAM WILL ACCEPT PREVIOUSLY
CREATED INDIRECT OR COMMAND FILE INPUTS. ^USE OF INDIRECT FILES, CAREFULLY
CREATED, IS A TECHNIQUE THAT CAN SAVE MUCH TIME FOR
EXPERIENCED OPERATORS.

.CENTER
------ - -------- ---- ----------
.INDEX <MAGCON <INTRODUCTION
.SKIP 1
I.  INTRODUCTION TO MAGCON
.SKIP 1
.FILL.JUST
MAGCON is a program which transfers data and will convert
from one character set to another in the process.  It runs
on the TYMCOM X and is designed mainly for use with magnetic
tapes and disk (FTA, MTA and DSK) although it will
use other devices.  MAGCON will perform blocking, duplication,
character set conversion, unblocking, and positioning.  It can
also prepare an octal dump of a file which can be
printed or type a file containing text.
.SKIP 1
MAGCON may be used in either of two modes, dialog or
command.  During dialog mode, information is input to MAGCON
in terms of answers to questions.  Command mode requires the
user to input in a specific format the information needed to
effect a data transfer or store a command or perform other
functions.  MAGCON can be operated from command files.  When
MAGCON is started up, it is in dialog mode; to change to
command mode, an "!" is input as the answer to the first
question.  (See Sections 3 and 4.)
.SKIP 1
Character sets with more than 128 characters cannot be fully
handled, and characters in some sets may not have
suitable equivalents in the target desired sets.  ^If a character
cannot be translated, MAGCON places a back slash "_\" in that
position in the record.  A tally of the number of bad
characters (not translatable) is printed out when the
transfer is complete.
.SKIP 1
In general, commands and switches may be abbreviated to
any number of characters that will allow that command to
be uniquely interpreted.  However, no more than six characters
are checked for validity in any of the commands.
.SKIP 1
A command file that MAGCON will read for commands is denoted
by the character "@".
.SKIP 1
To leave MAGCON, type an <alt-mode or a <control <c (_^<c) or use the
QUIT command during command mode.

II.  Definitions
.SKIP 1
The following definitions should be helpful in understanding
the information that must be supplied to MAGCON.
.SKIP 1
BLOCK
.SKIP 1
A block pertains to a set of one or more records which
MAGCON deals with as a unit.  On a tape, this will be
the same as a physical record.
.SKIP 1
LOGICAL RECORD
.SKIP 1
A record refers to a contiguous set of characters which
may be delimited by a CR-LF sequence or be defined by a
character count.  A record is artificially defined; it
has no relationship to the device.
.SKIP 1
BLOCK FACTOR
.SKIP 1
This refers to the number of records contained in a block.  This
is a value that the user of MAGCON must supply for
tape files.  Blocking, the grouping of records together in
a block involves a special structure or meaning in only
two cases.  One is the special block structure of a VEBCDIC
file, and the other is the separation of HPASCII blocks with
blank tape.  (See also Section 5.)
.SKIP 1
UNBLOCKED TAPE
.SKIP 1
In this context, an unblocked tape will refer to one whose
block factor is one.
.SKIP 1
PHYSICAL RECORD
.SKIP 1
A physical record is device dependent and refers to the
smallest unit of data that can be processed by the hardware
(128 words for disk, 80 columns for card reader, the data
between gaps for magnetic tape).  The blocks and records
mentioned above may cross the boundaries of these
physical records.
.SKIP 1
CHARACTER OR BYTE
.SKIP 1
The number of bits forming a character or byte is dependent
on the mode of the data.  If one is reading an EBCDIC tape,
the character size of the input is considered to be eight
bits.  If operating in image mode, the byte size dealt with
is a whole word, 36 bits.
.SKIP 1
INDUSTRY TAPE
.SKIP 1
An industry tape or industry compatible tape refers to
one whose character size is eight bits and which can be read or
written four characters at a time (in 32 bit words).
.SKIP 4

EOF MARK
.FILL.JUST
.SKIP 1
An EOF mark follows every file on a magnetic tape.  It consists
of a record containing an octal 17 (for 7-track tapes) or an
octal 23 (for 9-track tapes).
.SKIP 1
EOT MARK
.SKIP 1
MAGCON does not write any special end of tape mark.

.INDEX <MAGCON <DIALOG <DESCRIPTION
III.  Questions Asked in Dialog Mode
.SKIP 1
A set of questions is asked the user for the input and output
files.  The first two questions are always asked.  Depending
upon the answers to those questions and whether the file is
for input or output, the remaining questions which apply
will be asked.  Changes to the numbered questions, asked during the
dialog or not, may be made as noted when MAGCON prompts for
corrections following the dialog, or before a repeat.
.SKIP 1
1. FILE:
.SKIP 1
Enter a file name which may take one of the following general
forms.
.SKIP 1
.CENTER;DEVICE:FILE.EXTENSION(username)
.SKIP 1
.CENTER;or
.SKIP 1
.CENTER;DEVICE:(username)FILE.EXT
.SKIP 1
.FILL.JUST
The complete file specification is optional and will take on
default values if any part of it is omitted.  For example,
the device will default to DSK: and the user name to the current
disk area.  The input and output file names will be
created as follows.  The file names will have the form
FILXXX where XXX is a three-digit number, and the file extensions
will have the form XXX where is XXX is the same three-digit
number.  Numbering starts at 001 when MAGCON is run, and the
values are incremented as needed to get unique file names.
.SKIP 1
If the output device is a magnetic tape, and the drive is
write-locked, MAGCON allows the user to remount the
tape correctly and continue.  MAGCON will type:
.NOFILL.NOJUST
.SKIP 1
        FILE "file spec." STRUCTURE IS WRITE-LOCKED.
        REMOUNT TAPE IF YOU WISH TO CONTINUE
        CONTINUE?
.FILL.JUST
.SKIP 1
A "<YES" answer tells MAGCON to continue.  A "<NO"
answer causes the program to restart the output dialog.

Changes:  There are no restrictions; however the rest of the
dialog for either input or output is done over if
the device changes from the previous value.

various transfers of multiple files.  The following table

If a label is used, the following 2 questions are asked:
.SKIP 1
    REEL:
.SKIP 1
Sets the reel serial number in labels  that  have  this  feature.
For some labels the reel serial number is retained when writing over a
label.  For instance, for BURROUGHS labels the output tape is read  to
retrieve  the  serial number and then a new label is written with this
number.  To override this feature the reel option  is  given  and  the
output tape is not read first.
.SKIP 1

This question is not asked during the dialog.  The default is <YES for
EBCDIC and HPASCII tapes and <NO otherwise.  This refers to a
tape in industry compatible mode in which its 8-bit characters
are written or read in groups of four (a 32-bit word).  The
buffer storage of characters to be written (or just read)
contains words of four characters with the low order four bits
not used.

22. MULTIPLE OUTPUT FILES FOR THIS INPUT FILE?
.SKIP 1
This question is asked for input files.  MAGCON will allow the
user to split up the input file by blocks into separate
output files.  In this case, a block is considered to be a
physical record on the particular device involved.  if
the user answers <YES, then the following
questions will be asked:
.SKIP 1
   NUMBER OF BLOCKS TO SKIP:
.SKIP 1
If the input file is being  split  into  separate  output  files,
MAGCON  allows the user to skip a number of blocks before writing into
the output file.
.SKIP 1
   NUMBER OF BLOCKS TO TRANSFER:
.SKIP 1
If the input file is being  split  into  separate  output  files,
MAGCON asks how many blocks to transfer.
.SKIP 1
Changes:  Need same conditions as for question to be asked.
.SKIP 1
23. DO YOU WISH ONLY 1 OUTPUT RECORD PER INPUT RECORD?
.SKIP 1
This question is asked if output, the file is on disk, the
mode is either GEASCII, HPASCII, or ASCII, and the output
record size is less than the input record size.  In
other cases, the supplied default is <YES meaning the output
records may be truncated.  If the user answers <NO, then
MAGCON will create a new record from information remaining from
an input record which will not fit in the output record.

Enter the number of the appropriate question.  MAGCON will ask
the question if the change conditions are met, and the answer
can be supplied.  These questions continue until
a "Y" answer indicates all entries are correct.  MAGCON allows
corrections after each dialog or before a repeat.  Enter input
changes only when MAGCON asks about input entries and output
entries only when MAGCON asks about output entries.

USING "DSK:MAGCON.DAT" CONVERSION FILE - OK?
.SKIP 1
This question is asked if MAGCON finds a conversion file in
the user's directory.  If it is acceptable to use this
file, then answer <YES.  If a <NO answer is given, then
the standard file found in SYS is used.  For more information
about using a special conversion table, see the documentation for
the program MAGTAB found in MAGTAB.DOC and also
MAGCON.INF.
.SKIP 1
SUBSTITUTIONS?
.SKIP 1
MAGCON allows the user to make a small number of changes to the
standard substitutions in the conversion table MAGCON uses by
entering them from the keyboard.  If this question is answered
affirmatively, MAGCON will type:
.SKIP 1

OKAY TO WRITE ON OLD FILE?
.SKIP 1
Is it all right to write over the existing file on disk with
the name specified?
.SKIP 1
REPEAT SPECIFICATIONS?
.SKIP 1
This question is asked following a completed data transfer.  The
transfer may be repeated with the same specifications, or the
user may correct individual responses; MAGCON will ask if
all input and then all output specifications are correct.  If
either the file device or the mode changes, then the remaining questions
of the dialog will be asked.  In other cases, the user
will be responsible for changed responses which should be altered
to conform with any of his/her corrections.  Use with
care.  (See warning concerning the use of wild card file

.NOTE
THIS FORM OF MAGCON IS SELDOM USED; DESPITE IT'S ADVANTAGES, IT IS MORE
DIFFICULT FOR THE OPERATOR SINCE THE PROGRAM WILL DO NO PROMPTING
FOR INPUT AND OUTPUT SPECIFICATION.
.END NOTE
IV.A  Format of Data Transfer Commands
.SKIP 1
The commands which effect a data transfer, performing the
same function as the dialog, use the traditional DECsystem-10
command string format.  MAGCON will accept one input
file specification and one output file specification separated by
a back arrow "__" or equal sign "=".  For example:
.SKIP 1
.CENTER;OUTPUT FILE__INPUT FILE
.SKIP 1
.CENTER;or
.SKIP 1
.CENTER;OUTPUT FILE=INPUT FILE
.SKIP 1
The file specifications are the same as described in Section 2,
question 1 except that the device name must always be
present.
.SKIP 1
IV.B  Switches for Data Transfer Commands
.SKIP 1
Each input or output file file specification must contain
switches to give MAGCON the necessary information about the
files being handled.  A switch begins with a slash and is
terminated by the next slash or by the carriage return
which terminates the whole command as well.  For example:
.SKIP 1
.CENTER;/SWITCH
.SKIP 1
.CENTER;or
.SKIP 1
.CENTER;/SWITCH:ARGUMENT
.SKIP 1
In all cases, switches may be abbreviated to the number of
characters that will allow unique interpretation of that
switch.  In the following table of possible switches, "n" represents
an integer decimal number, and "ARG" represents a key word
that must be present.  The values of the switches and the
arguments should be apparent from referencing the
corresponding dialog question.  Switches flagged with an "*"
can be turned off or have the opposite effect noted by
concatenating "<NO" with the switch.  For example:  NOLIST,
NOCRLF.

.SKIP 1
An ASCII record is a set of contiguous 7-bit characters whose
boundary may be determined by a carriage return-line feed
sequence or a character count.  An ASCII disk file is stored with
five 7-bit characters to the word with the low order bit not
used.  A successive record begins at the character following
the last character of the previous record.  If
terminated by a CR-LF sequence, the
records are probably random length; the records would
be fixed length otherwise and may contain a blank fill.  MAGCON
will fill a fixed length record with blanks on output to
satisfy the character count given.  Null characters found
during an ASCII transfer are discarded.
.SKIP 1
HPASCII
.SKIP 1
The general characteristics of ASCII files hold for HPASCII
files with the exception that the characters are 8-bit
values.  A buffered record is stored with four characters to each
word and the low order four bits not used.  Tapes
written by MAGCON in HPASCII format will contain additional
blank tape between each block.  Character values <= 377 octal are
equivalent to the ASCII values.
.SKIP 1
GEASCII
.SKIP 1
The general characteristics of ASCII files hold for GEASCII
files.  The characters are 9 bits long and are stored on the
disk four to a word.  Characters whose values
are <= 377 octal are equivalent to the ASCII characters.
.SKIP 1
BCD
.SKIP 1
Records are composed of a contiguous set of 6-bit
characters of a length determined by a character count.  In core,
bytes are stored six to a word.  In order to satisfy an
output character count, MAGCON will fill with blanks; records
being read from a tape may have this same characteristic.

SIXBIT
.SKIP 1
A SIXBIT record consists of a contiguous set of 6-bit
characters.  When buffered, the records consist of an
integral number of words.  The right half of the first
word, the header, contains the number of characters in
the record, excluding that first word, and the remainder
of the record follows.
.SKIP 1
EBCDIC
.SKIP 1
An EBCDIC record is a set of 8-bit characters whose
boundary is determined by a character count.  When
buffered or stored, the characters are packed four to
a word with the low order four bits not used.  In order
to satisfy an output character count, MAGCON will pad
with blanks; records being read from a tape may have
this same characteristic.

VEBCDIC
.SKIP 1
Variable EBCDIC characters are the same as EBCDIC
characters.  VEBCDIC files may have one of two block
structures.  In unblocked format, a block and a record
are equivalent.  In blocked format (blocking factor _> 1), a
block contains more than one record and has an additional
header word describing the size of the entire block.  The
individual records follow.

.SKIP 1
.FILL.JUST
In these formats, the character counts include the header
words.  When buffered, bytes are stored four to a word as
for EBCDIC.
.SKIP 1
IMAGE
.SKIP 1
IMAGE mode referes to the treatment of a file as
a contiguous set of binary data.  Every bit
counts.  If the input file is treated as IMAGE,
then the output mode must be in IMAGE or OCTAL.
.SKIP 1
OCTAL
.SKIP 1
OCTAL mode can be used as an output mode only.  The
input file is treated as image no matter how the user
specifies it.  An OCTAL mode file, when typed on the
TTY or spooled to a line printer, is an octal
dump of the original file.

^THE HELPFUL HINTS DOCUMENTED BELOW ARE DERIVED FROM <MAGCON
EXPERIENCES AND ARE PRESENTED TO ASSIST YOU WITH SITUATIONS WHICH
MIGHT OTHERWISE BE UNDULY TROUBLESOME.
.SKIP 1
^WHEN DOING A <MAGCON RESTORE, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WORK FROM A
<TYMCOM-X UTILITY DIRECTORY (E.G., <OPER). 
^ONLY AFTER THE CONVERSION HAS BEEN <QA'D SHOULD FILES BE RENAMED INTO
THE USER'S DIRECTORY.
.SKIP 1
^THE MOST COMMON DATA FORMATS IN USE TODAY ARE <ASCII, <HPASCII,
<EBCDIC AND <VEBCDIC.
<BCD IS SELDOM USED.
.SKIP 1
9-TRACK TAPES ALWAYS USE ODD PARITY.
.SKIP 1
7-TRACK TAPES USUALLY USE EVEN PARITY.
.SKIP 1
^THERE IS NO GUARANTEED <MAGCON CAPABILITY TO CONVERT BINARY FILES
EXCEPT TO OR FROM ANOTHER <PDP-10.
^THE <IMAGE OPTION ASSUMES THE CONVERSION WILL BE 36-BIT WORD TO
36-BIT WORD.
.SKIP 1
^GIVEN THE ABOVE LIMITAION, IF YOU SHOULD GET A <MAGCON JOB DESCRIPTION
TO CONVERT "ALL THE FILES IN MY DIRECTORY" INCLUDING 
<REL AND <SAV EXTENSION FILES, EXPECT THAT THOSE BINARY FILES
WON'T CONVERT PROPERLY.
^UNLESS THE DESTINATION COMPUTER HAS A FANCY CONVERSION PROGRAM
AT THE USER'S END, BINARY CONVERSIONS PROBABLY WON'T WORK.
.SKIP 1
^IF A <MAGCON REQUESTS THAT <HPASCII BE USED, IT IS VERY LIKELY
THE USER'S SYSTEM IS A MINI-COMPUTER; MOST MINI'S USE 8-BIT 
<ASCII, ESPECIALLY ON 16-BIT WORD LENGTHS WHERE 8-BIT CAN RESULT IN
TWO CHARACTERS PER WORD.
^THE <PDP-10'S, ON THE OTHER HAND, USE 7-BIT <ASCII.
.SKIP 1
^IF YOU RUN INTO TROUBLE IN A <PDP-10 CONVERSION, IT MIGHT BE
A GOOD IDEA TO SUGGEST THAT <PIP BE USED INSTEAD OF <MAGCON.
.SKIP 1
^ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IN <MAGCON IS WHEN THE USER DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND OR KNOW THE RECORD LENGTH INVOLVED IN THE JOB.
^TO HELP FIND OUT WHAT RECORD LENGTH APPLIES, IT IS VERY HELPFUL
TO FIND OUT WHAT TYPE OF COMPUTER THE <MAGCON IS TO BE USED FOR.
.SKIP 1
^IN GENERAL, IT IS BEST TO USE FIXED LENGTH RECORDS, ESPECIALLY
IF YOU CAN SUPPLY THE RECORD LENGTH OF THE LONGEST RECORD IN THE
FILE; THEN SMALLER RECORDS IN THE FILE WILL BE FILLED IN BY <MAGCON.
.SKIP 1
^HOWEVER, FOR MOST <ASCII OR <EBCDIC CONVERSIONS, THE ANSWER TO THE
PROMPT FOR "<VARIABLE <LENGTH <RECORDS?" SHOULD GENERALLY BE <YES.
.SKIP 1
^THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS CERTAINLY CAN APPLY TO
<MAGCON.
^YOU SHOULD NOT SPEND HOURS ON CONFUSING TAPE CONVERSION; IT IS
RECOMMENDED THAT YOU SPEND NO LONGER THAN 30-45 MINUTES TRYING TO
DISCOVER THE CORRECT <MAGCON SPECIFICATIONS.

.SKIP 1
^COMPARING <CHECKSUM'S IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO <QA A <MAGCON; EVEN IF THE
CONVERSION WAS CORRECT, THERE WERE PROBABLY ENOUGH VARIABLES INVOLVED
IN THE CONVERSION SO THAT THE CONVERTED FILE'S <CHECKSUM WILL NOT AGREE 
WITH THE ORIGINAL FILE'S <CHECKSUM.
.SKIP 1
^IF <MAGCON REPORTS "BAD CHARACTERS", THIS DOES NOT REFLECT <READ
OR <WRITE ERRORS.
^RATHER, IT MEANS THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO TRANSLATE CERTAIN CHARACTERS
FROM ONE MODE TO ANOTHER.
^THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED IN SOME MODES; CERTAIN <EBCDIC CHARACTERS MIGHT 
NOT BE IN THE <PDP-10 CONVERSION TABLES.
^IT IS THE NUMBER OF "BAD CHARACTERS" WHICH IS CRUCIAL.
^ALL BAD CHARACTERS WILL HAVE A BACKSLASH IN PLACE OF THE 
UNTRANSLATABLE CHARACTER.
^CHECK THE LISTING OF THE CONVERTED FILE; IF THERE IS A HIGH NUMBER OF
BACKSLASHES, A CALL TO THE CUSTOMER OR HIS/HER <BT <TYMNET <INC REPRESENTATIVE
MIGHT BE IN ORDER.
.SKIP 1
^MOST OF THE DATA INVOLVED IN <MAGCONS IS IN FIELD FORMAT--THAT 
IS, COLUMNS.
^IF THE LISTING YOU OUTPUT DOESN'T LINE UP, THERE ARE TWO 
COMMON REASONS:
.SKIP 1
.INDENT5
1. ^SLANTING COLUMNS INDICATE THAT THE RECORD LENGTH NUMBER
YOU INPUT MIGHT BE OFF A FEW CHARACTERS.

2. ^WHEN THE DATA APPEARS TO WRAP AROUND THE LISTING, THERE

^WHEN YOU ARE CONVERTING FROM DISK TO TAPE YOU CAN USE *.* TO
REFER TO ALL FILES IN A GIVEN DIRECTORY.
^HOWEVER, TO STORE ALL THE FILES A SECOND TIME (I.E., <REPEAT
