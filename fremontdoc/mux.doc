                               1 -  Using the MUX







                               1.1  Introduction


           The  MUX is  a process,  which resides  in an  ISIS  slot and
        allows a  user to create  and communicate with  several circuits
        through a  single (physical)  terminal, or  circuit.  It  can be
        used to build, interconnect, and control sets of circuits.

           Each user is allowed to control his own set of circuits; each
        set of  circuits is  associated with a  unique user  name.  Your
        user name is  the name you  used to log  into the MUX,  and this
        user name must be assembled into the code.  There is no  way for
        another user to access or control another user's circuits.

           The MUX  can be  accessed by multiple  users each  having one
        controlling or BOSS circuit.  This circuit, in  conjunction with
        different MUX  commands, is used  to control the  other circuits
        assigned to the user.

           Through the MUX a user :

              1.  Can have immediate access to more than 1 circuit.
              2.  Can  communicate  with these  circuits  through 1
                  physical  terminal (such  as  at home  or  on the
                  road.).
              3.  Can telecopy between circuits.
              4.  Can interleave  the output  of two  different but
                  related circuits.  (So that their  times relative
                  to each other may be viewed)
              5.  Can retain all circuit connections  regardless of
                  status  of  controlling  terminal.   For example,
                  other   circuits   remain    connected   although
                  controlling circuit is zapped.
              6.  Can communicate with  any other MUX user,  who is
                  logged in at the same time.
              7.  Selective output  to a hard  copy or  CRT through
                  use of inter-circuit telecopy.

        Using the MUX                                      April 1, 1983


                              1.2  Operating Modes


           The MUX operates in three different modes. These are:

              A)  Command  mode: where  the users  input  (from the
                  boss port) is  taken as commands directed  to the
                  MUX.

              B)  Send mode: in this  mode all of the  data entered
                  at the BOSS port (by the user) is sent  along the
                  user's  SEND port.   This appears  like  a normal
                  network connection.

              C)  Talk  mode:  during  which one  user can  talk to
                  another.   It  is not  necessary  for  the person
                  receiving the message to be in talk mode,  he may
                  be in any mode.  The commands HEAR and NOHEAR are
                  used to turn on and off the talk function  if the
                  user does not wish to be interrupted.   This mode
                  is  not  as transparent  as  send  mode:  Certain
                  control characters are  filtered out in  order to
                  protect the innocent.






                              1.3  Login Procedure






                    1.3.1  Login and Greeting

           To gain access to the MUX you must first have your  user name
        assembled into the current  MUX.  Along with the user  name, the
        user's  default  attention  character  (ATTN),  and  HEAR/NOHEAR
        status is defined.  Once  your user name has been  assembled in,
        you  may  log  into  the MUX  just  like  any  other  host (i.e.
        username:999;password).  When you log in you will be  greeted by
        something like this:

              >>> MULTIPLEXER <<<
              VERSION 3.00, HOST 999
              <<some optional message>>
              <<other circuits, if any>>
              BOSS

              &

        Using the MUX                                      April 1, 1983


           First of  all, the  version number  is printed  and therefore
        indicates whether or not the MUX has changed since the last time
        you used it.

           The MUX has  printed the host  number as a  verification that
        you have logged into the MUX that you wanted to.

           An  optional  greeting  message  can be  set  by  use  of the
        GREETING command.  This message will be output to each user only
        once, upon the initial login after the message is set.

           If other circuits are still present from a prior login, these
        will be  listed with  the asterisk  indicating the  current send
        port.

           The MUX prints a prompt character to inform the user  that he
        is in command mode.  The MUX prompt character can be one of four
        characters: "#", "$", "%", "&".  This character varies  with the
        host number, and can be used to distinguish between  MUX's.  The
        formula for  determining the prompt  character is based  on host
        number as follows:

              evenly divisible by 4..........#
              (evenly divisible by 4)+1......$
              (evenly divisible by 4)+2......%
              (evenly divisible by 4)+3......&

           When you log into a  MUX that circuit becomes the  BOSS.  The
        BOSS is the  only circuit that is  allowed to issue  commands to
        the MUX.

                               2 -  MUX Commands







                             2.1  Types of Commands


           There are  two types  of commands  available.  The  first are
        commands which are entered when the MUX is in command  mode.  In
        this mode you are talking directly to the MUX (As opposed to one
        of your user circuits.) The MUX will display a  prompt character
        on your screen to indicate  that it is waiting for  input.  This
        is the mode that you start off in.

           The second type of  command is the immediate  command.  These
        commands are entered using a special, user  definable, attention
        character (ATTN).






                              2.2  Command Format


           Commands sent directly to the MUX have the following format:

              <command><dlim><string>

              where

                <command>  is   a  valid   MUX  command   or  valid
                            abbreviation  of  a  MUX  command.   It
                            should be  noted that the  commands are
                            not dependent on case; lower-case is as
                            valid as upper case.

                <dlim>     is  a  valid mux  delimiter.   These are
                            comma,  space,  period,  slash,  colon,
                            delete, or carriage-return.

                <string>   is   an   optional   string   containing
                            parameters  for  the  command,  such as
                            port numbers, or a login string.

           Keeping  the  above  in  mind  you  can  see  that  there are
        different ways  to represent  the HELP  command, all  valid, all
        produce the same result.  They are: HELP, HEL, HE, and H.






                          2.3  Informational Commands






                    2.3.1  HELP

           The  HELP  command prints  a  descriptive list  of  valid MUX
        commands and a configuration definable message.





                    2.3.2  VERSION

           The VERSION command will display the current version and host
        number in the format:

              VERSION 3.00, HOST 999





                    2.3.3  WHO

           The WHO command  will display the names  of all of  the users
        currently logged in  on the MUX.  Printed  to the right  of each
        name  is a  special character  indicating their  current status.
        The exclamation  point (!)  indicates that the  user has  a boss
        port logged into  the MUX.  This  is redundant in  this command,
        since only the users that are logged in are listed, but  is used
        in the ALLWHO  list.  You may  communicate with another  user by
        going  into TALK  mode as  described later.   Your user  name is
        indicated by an asterisk.

                    2.3.4  ALLWHO

           The ALLWHO  command lists  all users that  are valid  on this
        MUX, even if they are  not logged in.  Users that are  logged in
        have their  names followed by  an exclamation point.   Your user
        name is indicated by an asterisk.





                    2.3.5  LIST

           The LIST command is used to list all of your active circuits.
        The output format is:

              Lab1
              254 *
              BOSS

           The fields (Lab1, 254 and BOSS in the above example)  are the
        names of  the circuits  which you  have assigned.   The asterisk
        indicates the latest  circuit which was  in send mode.   The MUX
        always  assigns a  numeric  label to  every port  that  has been
        created.  The boss is always assigned the label "BOSS",  and you
        are not allowed to change it.  In cases where the "BOSS" circuit
        is  transferred, either  by  a later  login or  by  the TRANSFER
        command, the old "BOSS" is automatically labelled "SLAVE".  This
        name can  be changed  by the user.   When constructing  a normal
        circuit the MUX assigns a label in the form: "XXX", where XXX is
        the decimal ISIS port number.





                    2.3.6  DATE, TIME

           The DATE command prints the date and the 24-hour time  of day
        (i.e. 31Dec83 23:59).  The TIME command prints only  the 24-hour
        time of day (i.e. 23:59).





                    2.3.7  MESSAGE

           Displays  the  current  system  message.   The  MUX  has  the
        ability, through the  GREETING command, to broadcast  a message,
        once to each user, at  the time they log in.  Typically  this is
        used to inform users when  the MUX is expected to be  down, what
        the latest revisions are, etc.

                    2.4.1  MAKE

           The  MAKE  command  is  probably  the  most  frequently  used
        command.  As it's name implies it is used to make a new circuit.

           The format of the instruction is:

              MAKE<cr><dlim><user-name>:<sys>;<password><dlim>

           examples:

              make c<cr>    [a circuit to gateway]

              M<cr>
              c<cr>         [same circuit as above]

              make,USERNAME:170;<password><cr>

           After  the  circuit  has been  requested,  you  are connected
        directly to it (send mode).  Any characters that you  type, once
        the  circuit has  been  established are  now sent  down  the new
        circuit and not treated as commands to the MUX.

           This becomes a very  natural sequence, as this  example shows
        (comments are in [brackets], computer responses in UPPER-CASE):

              make,PLEASE LOG IN:c<cr>   [make circuit to pub-net]
              INTER-LINK ESTABLISHED FROM BUBB-NET TO TYMNET
              PLEASE LOG IN:username:555;<password>
              WELCOME TO TYMSHARE SYSTEM 555.
              READY>_

           We  are now  in communication  with a  host somewhere  in the
        public network, and everything you type will be sent to  it, and
        all of it's responses will be sent to you.

           The only commands which the  MUX will respond to now  are the
        immediate commands, entered by use of the attention character.

        MUX Commands                                       April 1, 1983


                    2.4.ARACTER

           The CHARACTER command sets  the character that is to  be used
        as the attention character.   The default, set at  assembly time
        is usually the ESC  (escape) character.  As you are  typing data
        into  your terminal,  and  it is  being switched  to  the proper
        circuit that you have created  with the MAKE command the  MUX is
        continually scanning the characters that you type.  If  it spots
        your attention character,  special action is taken.

           First  the MUX  looks  at the  next character  and  checks it
        against the list it has  of immediate commands.  If it  does not
        find  a match  then both  characters are  discarded,  and normal
        processing  continues.   If  the  second  character  is  also an
        attention character  then one attention  character is  sent.  If
        the second character is an immediate command character then that
        command is executed (see section on immediate commands).

           This  is  the only  way  that you  can  interrupt  the normal
        sending of data on a circuit.





                    2.4.3  SEND

           The SEND command is  used to define the destination  port for
        characters  you  are  typing.  The  format  of  this  command is
        "SEND<dlim><port label>".  Where port  label is the name  of one
        of your ports.

           Using  the LIST  command  you can  get  a list  of  your port
        labels.  For example if your list command resulted in:

              %l<cr>
              C39
              PROBE *
              BOSS
              %_
        And you wanted to send data or commands to the circuit  that you
        had labeled "C39", you  would type "S C39<cr>", "s  c<cr>", etc.
        Note that the <cr> is required to terminate any SEND command, no
        other delimiter will work.

           This will give you a full-duplex path that appears  just like
        a  normal  network  connection  (with  the  exception   of  your
        attention character, which must be pressed twice every  time you
        wish to send it once.)

           The send command has one other format, that is "S<cr>".  This
        will cause you to "SEND" on the last port you last port you were

        sending to, if that port is still active.  For  your convenience
        the port  that you would  send to if  you choose this  format is
        flagged  (by the  list command)  with an  asterisk (*).   In the
        example  above, typing  "S<cr>" would  have you  sending  to the
        circuit labeled "PROBE".





                    2.4.4  EXIT, QUIT

           Exit from the MUX

           The EXIT command, in effect  zaps the boss port.  It  has the
        same  effect as  disconnecting,  or turning  off  your terminal.
        Please  note  that all  of  your other  (non-BOSS  circuits will
        remain intact.

           The QUIT command  zaps all of  the circuits assigned  to your
        user name.   This includes both  the boss port  and all  of your
        user ports.





                    2.4.5  ZAP

           Zap any given port(s).   This command zaps the port  or ports
        specified.   The command  continues  to accept  (and  zap) ports
        until either a)  A <cr> is entered,  or b) an  unrecognized port
        label is specified.  A  "ZAP BOSS" command is equivalent  to the
        EXIT command.   A ZAP  command with no  parameters will  zap the
        current send port (the port flagged by an asterisk in  your port
        list).





                    2.4.6  FREEZE, THAW

           The FREEZE  command locks the  BOSS circuit onto  the current
        BOSS  port.   Lock  boss  on this  port.   This  command  in the
        opposite of the THAW command.  It informs the MUX that  you want
        to retain this circuit as the BOSS even if another  circuit logs
        in  to the  MUX  with your  user name.   Under  normal, default,
        conditions if you log into  a MUX with a user name  that already
        has a boss associated with it the MUX will recognize the new log
        in as the BOSS and down-grade the old boss to a SLAVE.

           The THAW command thaws  the BOSS port after a  FREEZE command
        has been issued.  Any new  ports logging in with your  user name
        will automatically become the BOSS port.  This condition  is the
        default.

           By the  way, the  TRANSFER command still  works, even  if the
        boss is frozen.





                    2.4.7  TRANSFER

           TRANSFER <port label>,  Transfer boss circuit.   This command
        transfers control of your boss circuit to the  circuit specified
        by <port  label>.  The MUX  will only allow  you to  transfer to
        ports that logged  in to the MUX,  not those the MUX  has built.
        The  current  BOSS  port  will  become  a  SLAVE,  and  the port
        specified will be the new BOSS.





                    2.4.8  OFF, ON

           OFF <port label>, Set output off.  This command  places ports
        in flush mode (i.e. stop sending data comming from this  port to
        the boss).  This state can be exited (changed) by any one of the
        following:  1)  By  entering  the  reversing  "ON  <port label>"
        command,  2)  By sending  to  that port  (either  by  the "SEND"
        command or by typing an ATTN-E,B, or F sequence)

           ON <port label>, Turn output back on.  This command turns the
        output of <port label>  back on after either an  ATTN-F, ATTN-B,
        or OFF <port label> command.





                    2.4.9  CONNECT

           CONNECT  <port  label   1>,<port  label   2>  --  Connect two
        circuits.  This command connects the output of the first circuit
        to the input of the second.

           If you  want a full  duplex path you  will need to  issue two
        connect  commands.  The  first CONNECT  A,B; the  second CONNECT
        B,A.  To  restore a port  to normal operation  you may  omit the
        second <port label> and the MUX will reconnect that port  to the

        BOSS.  In this case the first <port label> MUST be terminated by
        a carriage return.





                    2.4.10  LABEL,NOLABEL

           The LABEL command starts circuit labelling.  With this option
        selected each time data is about to be printed on the  boss port
        (from a user circuit.) The  MUX first checks to see if  the last
        data  sent was  also from  the same  port.  If  it was,  the MUX
        simply passes  the data on.   If the last  data sent was  from a
        different  circuit then  the  MUX prints  the label  of  the new
        circuit, and then the data.

           The NOLABEL command stops circuit labeling; no labels will be
        printed with data printed on the BOSS port.  This is the default
        state.





                    2.4.11  GREETING

           The  GREETING  command is  used  for adding  or  changing the
        optional greeting message output  to users at login or  with the
        MESSAGE command.  The message only appears at login if  the user
        has not received it at  a prior login.  This command  resets the
        flags  which  indicate this,  and  all users  will  get  the new
        message at the next login.

           The format of the greeting message is:

              GREETING<dlim><...text...><CTRL-D>

        The text  can be multiple  lines as a  CTRL-D is the  only valid
        terminator for the text.





                    2.4.12  TALK

           The TALK command allows one user to talk to another  user, as
        long as  the other  user has a  BOSS port  logged into  the MUX.
        Valid  recipients  can  be  found  by  using  the  WHO  command.
        However, a user may prevent others from talking to him by use of
        the NOHEAR command.

           The format of this command is:

              TALK<dlim><user name><dlim>
              <yak.......yak..........yak...
              .......yak.......yak><ATTN-Z>

        Once you have switched to TALK mode, the only way to  leave TALK
        mode is with the ATTN-Z immediate command.  All other characters
        are sent to the other user.





                    2.4.13  HEAR, NOHEAR

           The HEAR command allows other users to TALK to you.   This is
        the default state.  The NOHEAR command prevents other users from
        using  the TALK  command to  communicate with  you.  HEAR/NOHEAR
        status can  be established  for each  user in  the configuration
        parameter file.





                    2.4.14  SET

           The SET command allows the setting of terminal  parameters at
        the BOSS circuit's Tymsat.  The format is:

              SET<dlim><type><dlim><value><dlim>

              where
                   type    the decimal parameter type
                   value   the decimal value

           What these types and values are can be found in ISIS.DOC.






                            2.5  Immediate Commands


           Immediate commands  are one (1)  character commands  that are
        preceded by your attention character.  Many of them are valid in
        some modes, but not others.

                    2.5.1  ATTN-ATTN

           The simplest  of immediate commands:  The user must  type two
        attention characters  in order to  send one  attention character
        down the current circuit.





                    2.5.2  ATTN-Z

           Return to  command mode.  This  command, valid in  all modes,
        returns you to command mode, and prints the prompt character and
        waits for you to enter a MUX command.  This is used to  get back
        into command mode  so that you can  make a new circuit,  look at
        existing circuits, look at who is logged in, etc.





                    2.5.3  ATTN-E

           Switch  to New  Circuit.  This  command, only  valid  in send
        mode, will cause  you to "SEND" to  the next port that  you have
        defined, and print that port's label.  The MUX treats  your list
        of ports as circular  so that if you type  ATTN-E consecutively,
        enough times, you will end up on the port you started  from.  If
        you only have one user  (not boss) port defined you  will remain
        sending to that port, but it's label will print.





                    2.5.4  ATTN-B

           Backpressure, and  advance to next  port.  This  command also
        moves you to the next  port (as does the ATTN-E command)  but it
        also applies backpressure to  the port you had been  sending to.
        This command is only valid when in send mode.

                    2.5.5  ATTN-F

           Flush, and advance to  next port.  This command  is identical
        to  the ATTN-B  command except  that instead  of  applying back-
        pressure to the old port,  is places it into flush  mode.  Where
        all data received from that port is ignored.





                    2.5.6  ATTN-C

           Circuit Labeling.  This command takes the next  15 characters
        (or up to the <cr> if that occur first) and creates a  label for
        the current SEND circuit.  Labels default to "XXX" where  XXX is
        the corresponding ISIS port  number.  ATTN-C works only  in send
        mode.

           Circuits may be labeled/relabeled at any time,  except during
        the login for a new circuit.  The label assigned is printed when
        you do any of the following:

              ATTN-E
              ATTN-B
              ATTN-F
              LIST
              LABEL
              when a circuit is zapped





                    2.5.7  ATTN-N

           Sends user name out on circuit.  This command,  recognised in
        send mode, sends the user  name, followed by a colon  (:), along
        the circuit.  Very convenient for login dialogues.

                APPENDIX II.   MULTIPLEXER Version 3.00 Changes



        1.  Passwords should  no longer  be echoed  when you  are making
            a circuit.

        2.  The  commands "H=A"  and "H=H"  have been  removed.   If you
            didn't know they ever  existed, you're lucky.   If  you miss
            them, too bad.

        3.  The "HELP" command now prints a nice summary of all  the MUX
            commands.

        4.  When  the  current  send  circuit  gets  a  zapper,  you are
            returned     to command mode, instead of just hanging there.
            Also, the     next circuit in your list is made  the current
            circuit, so     that a "SEND" command with no parameter will
            start sending     to it.

        5.  A  "ZAP"  command with  no  parameter will  zap  the current
            circuit, instead of zapping a random circuit.

        6.  Terminal parameter changes (except input/output  baud rates)
            are now passed through to  the boss.  Each time you  move to
            a different circuit,  the terminal parameters in  the Tymsat
            are made to agree with what the circuit expects.

        7.  You can now  use the immediate  commands to leave  a circuit
            that  is in  login  mode.  You  can also  use  the immediate
            commands or the "SEND" command to move to a circuit in login
            mode.
