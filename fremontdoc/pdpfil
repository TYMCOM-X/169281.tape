^FILES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ^TYMSHARE SYSTEM.  ^A FILE CONTAINS
INFORMATION SUCH AS A PROGRAM OR DATA AND IS STORED ON A STORAGE DEVICE.
^UNLESS THE USER DECLARES FILES AS TEMPORARY, FILES ARE PERMANENT STORAGE;
THAT IS, THEY STAY ON THE SYSTEM UNTIL THE USER EXPLICITY REMOVES THEM,
EVEN THOUGH HE LOGS OFF AFTER EACH SESSION AT THE TERMINAL.  <XEXEC HAS
COMMANDS TO CREATE AND MODIFY FILES, LIST DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION ABOUT
THE FILES, CHANGE THE STANDARD PROTECTION CONTROLS FOR FILES, COPY FILES,
PRINT FILES, RENAME FILES, AND DELETE FILES FROM THE STORAGE AREA.

.CENTER;----------------------
.SKIP 1
^THE USER IDENTIFIES A FILE WITH A FILE NAME AND AN OPTIONAL EXTENSION.
^A FILE NAME MAY CONTAIN AS MANY AS SIX CHARACTERS, WITH ANY COMBINATION
OF LETTERS AND DIGITS.  ^THE USER MAY FIND IT CONVENIENT TO INCLUDE AN
EXTENSION IN THE FILE IDENTIFIER TO INDICATE THE TYPE OF INFORMATION
STORED ON THE FILE.  ^USUALLY THE EXTENSION IS A STANDARD ONE WHICH
<XEXEC RECOGNIZES.  ^A PERIOD (.) SEPARATES THE FILE NAME FROM ITS
EXTENSION.  ^THE EXTENSION MAY CONTAIN NO MORE THAN THREE ALPHANUMERIC
CHARACTERS.  ^THE SYSTEM RESERVES CERTAIN FILE NAMES WHICH THE USER SHOULD
NOT ATTEMPT TO USE TO IDENTIFY HIS FILES.  ^THE FOLLOWING ARE RESERVED
FILES NAMES:  <ALL, <HELP, <NOT, <SAME, AND ANY LEFT SUBSTRING OF THE
WORDS <TERMINAL AND <TELETYPE.

THE FILE NAME AND EXTENSION ARE SPECIFIED.  ^CERTAIN <XEXEC COMMANDS
ALLOW THE USER TO REFER TO A FILE WITHOUT SPECIFYING AN EXTENSION
PROVIDED THAT THE FILE IDENTIFIER HAS A STANDARD EXTENSION OR NO
EXTENSION.  ^THE COMPILE-TYPE COMMANDS, DESCRIBED ON PAGE 51 OF THE
<TYMCOM-X ^REFERENCE ^MANUAL, SEARCH FOR A STANDARD EXTENSION OR APPEND A
STANDARD EXTENSION TO A FILE IDENTIFIER THAT HAS NO EXTENSION.  ^THE
<GET, <RUN, AND <GO COMMANDS, DESCRIBED ON PAGE 66 OF THE SAME MANUAL,
SEARCH FOR THE <HGH EXTENSION FIRST, THEN THE <SHR EXTENSION, THEN
THE <SAV EXTENSION.  ^IF THE FILE IDENTIFIER HAS NO EXTENSION, <SAV IS
ASSUMED.  ^IF A FILE IDENTIFIER HAS A NON-STANDARD EXTENSION, THE 
EXTENSION MUST BE SPECIFIED WHEN REFERRING TO THE FILE.

.CENTER;---------------------
.SKIP 1
^ASTERISK NOTATION ALLOWS THE USER TO SPECIFY SEVERAL FILES WITH A 
SINGLE IDENTIFIER.  ^AN ASTERISK (*) CAN BE USED AS EITHER PART OF
A FILE IDENTIFIER TO INDICATE ALL FILE NAMES OR ALL EXTENSIONS.  ^FOR
EXAMPLE, <TEST1.* REFERS TO ALL FILES WITH THE NAME <TEST1, REGARDLESS
OF THE EXTENSION.  ^SIMILARLY, *.<F4 REFERS TO ALL  FILES WITH THE <F4 
EXTENSION.  ^THE USER MAY REFER TO ALL FILES IN HIS DIRECTORY WITH *.*
OR THE WORD <ALL.

SEVERAL FILES WITH A SINGLE IDENTIFIER.  ^A CROSSHATCH OR A QUESTION MARK
CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF A CHARACTER IN A FILE IDENTIFIER TO MEAN ANY
CHARACTER.  ^THE CROSSHATCH OR QUESTION MARK CAN BE USED REPEATEDLY AND
CAN BE INTERSPERSED THROUGHOUT THE FILE IDENTIFIER.  ^IF THE CROSSHATCH
OR QUESTION MARK IS AT THE END OF A FILE NAME OR EXTENSION, IT
REPRESENTS NO CHARACTER AS WELL AS ANY CHARACTER.  <TEST_#.REL,
FOR EXAMPLE, REFERS TO ALL FILE IDENTIFIERS WITH THE <REL EXTENSION AND
THE FILE NAME <TEST FOLLOWED BY ONE CHARACTER OR BY NO CHARACTERS AS IN
THE CASE OF <TEST.REL.

THE FILE NAME WITH THE OWNER'S USER NAME, ENCLOSED IN PARENTHESES.  FOR
EXAMPLE, (<OLSON) <INVEN REFERS TO THE FILE <INVEN LOCATED IN <OLSON'S
STORAGE AREA.  ^ONE USER MAY GAIN ACCESS TO A FILE IN ANOTHER USER'S
STORAGE AREA IF THE OWNER DECLARES THAT FILE TO BE SHARABLE.  ^THE OWNER

FROM HIS STORAGE AREA, OR CHANGE FILES IN HIS STORAGE AREA.
