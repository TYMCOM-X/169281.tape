ALLFILE TAPES WILL BE MICROFICHE INSTEAD OF MAKING A DIRECTORY OF
EACH TAPE.  THIS METHOD SAVES PAPER AND SPACE.  BELOW ARE THE PROCEDURES:
.SKIP 1
.LM 11
1.  RUN THE ALLFILES AS USUAL.
.SKIP 1
2.  CREATE A "DISC FILE DIRECTORY" OF THE ALLFILE TAPES.
.SKIP 1
3.  RUN THE PROGRAM '(UTIL)MICRO' TO CREATE A 'HEADER' FILE NAMING THE
FILE 'HEADER'.
.SKIP 1
4.  OBTAIN THE DESIGNATED SYSTEM TAPE FROM THE 'FICHE TAPE POOL' IN THE
TAPE LIBRARY.  USING 'MAGCON' FIRST STORE THE 'HEADER' AND THEN STORE
THE 'DISC DIRECTORY FILE'.  THERE IS NO NEED TO STORE THE FILES TO TAPE
MORE THAN ONCE.  USE THE FOLLOWING 'MAGCON' SPECS:  9 TRACK, 1600 BPI,
EBCDIC, RECL = 132, BLOCK =10.
.SKIP 1
5.  AFTER THE 'MAGCON' SESSION, MARK THE 'DATE' LABEL ON THE TAPE WITH THE
'DATE OF THE ALLFILES'; MARK THE SETL WITH THE 'SET NUMBER OF THE ALL
FILES'.
.SKIP 1
6.  WRITE THE 'DISC DIRECTORY FILE' OUT TO 'USERNAME (HOLD)' WITH
FILENAME: 'SSAFMM.DD'; WHERE 'SS=SYSTEM NUMBER, MM=MONTH OF ALLFILES,' AND
'DD=DAY OF ALLFILES.'  FOR EXAMPLE:  '74AF06.06 FOR F74 
ALLFILES RUN ON 06/06.
.SKIP 1
7.  AFTER THE 'DISC TO TAPE', 'TAPE TO DISC' SECTION AND THE
'MICRO-FICHE SECTION' IS COMPLETED AND INITIALED BY THE OPERATOR
AND QA'D BY THE SYSTEM QUALITY CONTROLLER, THE FORM WILL BE FILED IN
THE "ALL-FILES" RECORD BINDER.
.SKIP 1
THE 'HARDCOPY' OF THE RUN WILL HAVE THE SYSTEM NUMBER, DATE AND SET NUMBER
WRITTEN ON IT AND FILED IN THE APPROPRIATE BASKET LOCATED IN THE ROOM OFF
OF THE SYSTEM QUALITY CONTROL OFFICE.  THE "OLDEST" HARDCOPY FOR THE
SYSTEM SHOULD BE THROWN OUT.
.SKIP 1
THE MICRO-FICHE TAPE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO DISTRIBUTION TO BE SENT TO
MICROMEDIA.
.SKIP 1
8.  WHEN MICROFICHE SLIDES ARE RETURNED BY MICROMEDIA, THE TAPE LIBRARIAN WILL
CROSS OFF THE SET NUMBER ON THE ALLFILE STATUS REPORT; INITIAL, AND DATE
THE ALLFILES RECORD BINDER, AND THEN FILE THE SLIDES IN THE MICROFICHE HOLDER.
THE OLD SET OF MICROFICHE SLIDES ARE THROWN AWAY.
.SKIP 1
9.  IF FOR ANY REASON YOU CAN'T READ THE SLIDES, THEY ARE TO BE RETURNED,
WITH THE PROPER TAPE TO MICROMEDIA FOR A 'RE-D0'.  THERE IS NO CHARGE.
