<ONTYME ^BATCH ^RUN (<OTBATRUN) is an automated way of responding to
^Ontyme ^Batch ^Requests.  ^Instead of sending detailed mail to a
number of users, the <OTBATRUN program will be used to respond to
the original requestor for the request.  ^This will ease much needed

request.  ^The program is run after the request has been ^Quality
^Assurance checked <(QA'd).  ^All requests must be <QA'd within 24 hours
of its sending, not completion time.  ^There should not be any

^After exiting text mode, enter "**" in column one on the next line

your entries.  ^If the answer is no (n or <N), you will not be permitted
