                           AN INTRODUCTION TO TYMNET
                           -- ------------ -- ------

            TYMNET is a geographically distributed  virtual  circuit  switching
       computer network.  Circuit switching involves the dicipline of utilizing
       preestablished phone line routes  between  each  entry  point  and  each
       computer host.  If any path blockage, deterioration of signal quality or
       overload condition develops along this 'preferred  route'  an  alternate
       phone  line path for subsequent traffic can be automatically substituted
       by the centralized network control supervisor.  This is possible because
       the  geographical  distribution  of  the network uses an 'expanded ring'
       structure:  there are two (or more) possible paths to  route  data  from
       any point in the net to any destination computer.

            Since TYMNET became fully operational in 1971, it has expanded  and
       evolved   into   an   international  data  communications  network  with
       considerable scope and flexibility.  The principle use  of  the  network
       has been providing users with timesharing services and applications.  It
       is therefore  organized  around  a  'terminal  to  computer'  technology
       involving  low  speed,  full  duplex,  voice grade communications lines.
       TYMNET nulifies any geographical distances  between  the  user  and  the
       user's  data.   In  fact,  the  geographical location of the user's data
       becomes irrelevant once the user dials a local rotor number and accesses
       the  net.   An additional advantage of this geographical distribution is
       the ability to level  usage  loads  across  time  zones:   for  example,
       daytime  European users can take advantage of the light loads that exist
       at night on California computers.

            TYMNET also insulates the user from phoneline  errors  by  checking
       all  data packets each time the data is passed from one point to another
       along a given route.  If this checksum indicates an  error,  the  'store
       and  forward'  of the data is deferred until an automatic retransmission
       of correct data is performed.

            The ability to accomodate a variety of users requires  that  TYMNET
       be  able  to  understand  a wide variety of terminal types.  The network
       accomplishes this at the entry points into TYMNET.  Once  the  user  has
       entered  the  network,  the  local  minicomputer (remote or Tymsat), the
       system prompts for a terminal identifier.  This identifier sets  up  all
       the  parameters  which allow the terminal to understand the net and vice
       versa.

            TYMNET also has a 'computer to computer' capability  so  that  data
       and  computing  can  be  dispersed throughout the network.  This enables
       remote job entry and distributed processing.   For  example,  local  tax
       return  data  can  be  entered  into  regional  batch computers and then
       transmitted over the network to  large  scale  systems  where  the  main
       processing can be accomplished.

            Still another way to use TYMNET is for a client organization to use
       only  the  network  to interconnect terminals and computers owned by the
       client.  This saves the client the cost and effort  of  setting  up  and
       maintaining  a separate network.  This illustrates how TYMNET is a 'VAN'
       - Value Added Network.
                                                                         Page 4
TYMNET DEVELOPMENT


                              TYMNET DEVELOPMENT

            In 1969, a centrally directed network of Varian 620  mini-computers
       was developed by Tymshare.  When the network became fully operational in
       1971 it consisted of 30 nodes and a central supervisor  (with  3  backup
       supervisors)  that  ran  on an SDS 940 computer system.  The network has
       since undergone a prolonged evolution and has grown to over  300  NODES.
       These  nodes connect 90 domestic and international cities utilizing over
       50,000 miles  of  leased  telephone  lines,  including  two  independent
       trans-Atlantic  cables  and  a  trans-Pacific  cable.   Over  4000 users
       perform a wide range of data processing activies on 95 large scale  host
       computers  tied  into  Tymnet.  The nodes (or TYMSATS) are equipped with
       hardware to handle up to 32 or 64 asynchronous low speed  ports  (110  -
       1200  baud)  and  up  to  12  synchronous ports (2400 - 9600 baud) and 4
       bisynchronous ports (2400 to 4800 baud).  Connected to the  asynchronous
       ports  are  either  Bell 103/113 modems or Tymshare's equivalent MARK XV
       modems.  The TYMSATS are connected  using  Bell  long  Lines  with  Bell
       (201C,  202,  208,  209,  212, Bell's D.D.S.  service) and Vadic modems.
       Virtually every TYMSAT is connected with multiple phone lines permitting
       alternate  routing capability.  Routing within the nodes is done through
       routing tables called permuter tables.

            Tymnet technology is  moving  into  several  new  areas:   A  major
       message  switching  system called ONTYME has been implemented to provide
       mail storage and forwarding to a variety of  user  groups;   Design  and
       production  of a powerful network mini-computer called the TYMNET ENGINE
       is underway to assume a major  role  in  supervisor  and  node  hardware
       requirements of the future.

                           ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION

                A user connects his/her terminal to a host on  the  network  by
       dialing  a  local  node.   After  typing a character to identify his/her
       terminal characteristics, the user enters his/her user name, host number
       and  password.   This  information  is  sent,  by the local node, to the
       network supervisor.  The supervisor verifies  the  user's  name  in  the
       Master  User Directory (MUD) and then checks for a correct password.  If
       the user did not specify a host number,  his/her  standard  "home"  host
       number is taken from the MUD.    The supervisor now knows the node which
       the user called  (origination)  and  the  node  to  which  he  wishes  a
       connection (destination).  The supervisor then computes the minimum cost
       path for the virtual  circuit.   Once  a  path  has  been  plotted,  the
       supervisor  allocates  buffer pairs and permuter table positions in each
       node on the path to create the virtual circuit.  Messages  are  sent  to
       all nodes along the path to make the appropriate permuter table entries.
       This implicitly causes buffer assignments in the nodes.  Nodes  send  an
       acknowledgement  to  the supervisor after making a permuter table entry.
       Once all the acknowledgements are in,  the  supervisor  sends  the  user
       name,  the user's status (from the MUD), the originating node number and
       port number, and the terminal characteristics to the  destination  node,
       plus a message to tell the attached host that there is a new login.
                                                                         Page 5
TYMNET DEVELOPMENT


                The host may now read the user name to verify  that  this  user
       name  is  valid on this host.  No further checking is required!  All the
       security checking has been done for the host, with access restricted  to
       network  personnel.   And  all  passwords  are virtually invulnerable to
       theft.  This allows a host with minimal login security to  be  connected
       to  the  network, with confidence that only authorized people may log in
       through the network.  Additional log in  security  may,  of  course,  be
       imposed by the host computer system.
                                                                         Page 6
LOGIN ERROR MESSAGES


                     ERROR MESSAGES ASSOCIATED WITH LOGINS

            The following messages are transmitted to the  user  when  a  login
       attempt fails:

       1. HOST NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH NET
          ------------------------------

          THIS MESSAGE INDICATES THAT THE SUPERVISORS ARE NOT AWARE OF
          THE HOST NUMBER THE USER REQUESTED. IT CAN OCCUR WHEN (1) THE 
          SUPERVISOR HAS NOT TAKEN OVER THE BASE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
          REQUESTED HOST (I.E., ITS BASE IS DOWN), OR (2) IF THE SUPER-
          VISOR IS IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING OVER ALL OR A PORTION OF THE
          NETWORK AND HAS NOT TAKEN OVER THE BASE OR HOST BEING
          REQUESTED.

       2. HOST DOWN
          ---------

          THIS MESSAGE INDICATES THE BASE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REQUESTED
          HOST IS UP; HOWEVER, THE HOST ITSELF IS DOWN. THIS MESSAGE
          SHOULD ONLY OCCUR WHEN THE HOST IS TRULY DOWN.

       3. HOST SHUT
          ---------

          THIS INDICATES THE BASE AND HOST ARE UP; HOWEVER, LINES
          HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED. CERTAIN USERS (IE. OPER) CAN STILL
          LOGIN WITH THE 'SHUT OVERRIDE' BIT. THIS WILL NOT AFFECT
          ANY USERS ALREADY LOGGED ON THE SYSTEM.

       4. HOST OUT OF PORTS
          -----------------

          THIS MESSAGE INDICATES EVERYTHING IS UP AND OPERATIONAL;
          THERE ARE NO MORE PORTS AVAILABLE BETWEEN THE BASE AND HOST.
          IN OTHER WORDS, THE SYSTEM IS FULL.

       5. CIRCUITS BUSY
          -------------

          THIS MESSAGE INDICATES EVERYTHING IS WORKING; HOWEVER, THERE
          IS NOT ENOUGHT CAPACITY BETWEEN THE USER AND SELECTED HOST
          TO COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT.  TRY A DIFFERENT PHONE NUMBER,
          OR WAIT AND TRY AGAIN LATER.

       6. TRY AGAIN IN 5 MINS.
          --------------------

          DURING A SUPERVISOR TAKEOVER, LOG-INS ARE INHIBITED.
          THIS WAS DONE AS PART OF THE FIX TO PREVENT GARBAGE FROM
          ACCUMULATING IN THE NETWORK, AND THE HUNG USERS. DURING
          THE TWO TO FIVE MINUTES THE SUPERVISOR RETAKES THE NETWORK
          THE ABOVE MESSAGE WILL BE SENT.
                                                                         Page 7
NETWORK SUPERVISOR


                              NETWORK SUPERVISOR

                The network supervisor is a program that runs under  a  special
       time  sharing  system  on  an  Interdata 7/32.  The supervisor, like any
       piece of software, and the 7/32, like any piece of hardware, are subject
       to failure.  Although failures are infrequent (on the order of one every
       3 weeks) the absence of a supervisor to build virtual circuits cannot be
       tolerated  for  very  long.   To  deal  with  this  problem  4 potential
       supervisors exist in the network, only one of which is active at any one
       time.   The  active  supervisor  keeps  the other supervisors dormant by
       sending "sleeping pills" to them at regular intervals.   If  the  active
       supervisor  fails,  the  operators  at  the  network  control center can
       immediately awaken one of the dormant supervisors.  Even  without  human
       intervention,  the  dormant  supervisors  will notice the absence of the
       active supervisor when they cease  to  receive  "sleeping  pills".   The
       various  supervisors  have staggered 'drowsiness factors', at the end of
       which they will awaken if no sleeping pills have arrived.  Thus, in case
       of  a  supervisor failure one of the dormant supervisors will awaken and
       take control of the network.  It is possible for multiple supervisors to
       be  trying  to  take over the network simultaneously.  This situation is
       resolved gracefully by the less dominant supervisor going to sleep  when
       it discovers the presence of a more dominant supervisor.

                               NETWORK TAKEOVER

                In order to  control  nodes  and  carry  out  the  supervisor's
       function  of  building  virtual  circuits,  the supervisor must know the
       capacity of all nodes, their link capacities, the network  topology  and
       the value of every permuter table entry in the network.          A
       supervisor starting network takeover has no presupposed knowledge of the
       network  topology.  The supervisor first sends a takeover command to its
       own node, and learns of that node's capacity, the capacity of its links,
       every  permuter  table entry in that node and the neighbors of that node
       on each link.  The latter is the basis on which the supervisor discovers
       the topology of the network.  The supervisor now sends takeover commands
       to each neighbor of its own node.  As each of these  nodes  comes  under
       complete  control of the supervisor, each of its neighbors is checked to
       discover previously unknown nodes, and these are in turn taken over.  In
       this  way  the  supervisor  learns  the topology of the network, all its
       capacities and (from the permuter tables) which resources  are  in  use.
       In  1975  the supervisor running on the SDS 940 reached its capacity and
       was replaced by a sisor running  on  an  Interdata  7/32,  reducing
       network  takeover  time  from  15  minutes  to  2.5  minutes.   The time
       determining factors are the number of nodes, the bandwidth of  links  in
       the vicinity of the supervisor, the number of permuter table entries and
       the connectivity of the network vis-a-vis  the  supervisor's  own  node.
       From  a  control  standpoint the supervisor views the network as a tree.
       The control tree comprises a subset of the links in  the  network.   The
       balance  and  depth  of  this tree is the measure of connectivity of the
       network in relation to the supervisor's own node.        If a previously
       non-operational link becomes operational it may reveal one or more nodes
       that were previously inaccessible.  The supervisor would then extend the
       control  tree by taking over these newly discovered nodes.  On the other
       hand, if a link  that  is  part  of  the  control  tree  goes  out,  the
       supervisor loses control of the nodes in that subtree.  The control tree
       is then rebuilt to regain control of all the lost nodes that  are  still

       accessible through the network topology.

                The original TYMNET I nodes allowed  only  3  links  per  node.
       Presently  TYMNET I  nodes  allow  16  links per node.  The cost of more
       links is increased CPU and memory requirements for the  node.   However,
       even 16 links per node will soon be inadequate for the growth of TYMNET.
       One solution to this problem is  the  use  of  node  clusters.   A  node
       cluster is a group of 2 or more nodes in close proximity, interconnected
       by an inexpensive high speed distributed  memory  transfer  device.   We
       call  this  device  a  "memory  shuffler",  and  it  is  capable of data
       transfers at memory bandwidth rates.  A fully interconnected eight  node
       cluster  at  TYMNET's Cupertino center, with 72 links to the rest of the
       network is planned.  This approach creates a logically very  large  node
       (including two supervisor machines) that does not change the fundamental
       logical structure of the network.

BASE CRASHES


                     TYMCOM-IX BASE CRASHES AND RECOVERIES
                     -------- ---- ------- --- ----------

       ((INTRODUCTION))

            Since the Tymbase provides network access to two hosts,  if  either
       host  crashes,  the  base will continue to function as a node in Tymnet.
       But if the base crashes, the base will crash  both  hosts  connected  to
       that  base;  a host without a base is cut off from the outside world and
       cannot timeshare effectively.  A large majority of base crashes will  be
       self-recovering  for  the  base.   This means that the base has routines
       within itself to dump a copy of it's  core  image  into  the  respective
       hosts  for  analysis  later  on.   After  the base has dumped itself, it
       crashes both hosts connected to it and returns to it's normal  operation
       automatically.

            Occasionally however, the Tymbase will hangup in a loop  or  simply
       stop  functioning  and  display  the  'step'  light.  In these cases the
       operator must follow the procedures described in this document in  order
       that  the  base  crash  code can be saved, the hosts can be halted in an
       orderly fashion and the base  can  be  returned  to  normal  functioning
       through a TYMNET CONTROL initiated downstream base code load.

            Always remember to keep TYMNET NETWORK CONTROL CENTER  informed  on
       the status of any unusual activity that is occurring on any base.

BASE CRASH SUMMARY


       ((COMMAND SUMMARY))


                                         NOTE

           Full details on all summarized procedures  are  in  the  COMMAND
           DESCRIPTION section of this document.


               1) ANNOUNCE THE CRASH OVER THE COMLINE SPEAKER AND
                  CONTACT NETCON TO ADVISE THEM OF THE SITUATION;

               2) CHECK IF THE BASE IS IN STEP. IF NOT AND THE BIT LAMPS
                  ARE NOT FLICKERING FAINTLY THE BASE IS LOOPING.

               3) FOR 620L-100 BASES TURN THE FRONT PANEL KEY TO 'ON'
                  TO UNLOCK THE CONSOLE. IF THE BASE WAS LOOPING HIT THE
                  'STEP' SWITCH.

               4) CHECK AND RECORD THE FOLLOWING REGISTERS:
                  ON 620 BASES         RECORD P,U,A,B AND X REGISTERS

               5) CLEAR THE REGISTERS AND ATTEMPT TO RESTART FROM
                  P LOCATION 0; THIS DUMPS BASECODE TO THE 940.
                  AS THIS IS DONE THE 940'S WILL CRASH (IF THEY 
                  HAVEN'T CRASHED EARLIER). THIS PROCEDURE WILL
                  USUALLY CORRECT THE PROBLEM.

               6) IF RESTART FROM 0 FAILS, CONTACT NETWORK CONTROL AND
                  REQUEST A FRESH COPY OF THE BASE CODE BE LOADED OVER
                  THE NETWORK USING THE DOWNSTREAM LOADING PROTOCOL;

               7) IF NETCON IS UNABLE TO LOAD THE BASE, CHECK AND IF
                  NECESSARY CORRECT THE BOOTSTRAP FOR THAT BASE;

               8) WAIT A FEW MINUTES, THEN LOG A NEARBY TTY INTO PROBE.
                  CHECK THE STATUS OF THE BASE YOU JUST RESTARTED OR
                  OR NETCON JUST RELOADED WITH THE PROBE PROGRAM;

               9) IF THE BASE IS RUNNING PROPERLY, BRINGUP THE HOSTS
                  CONNECTED TO IT FOR TIMESHARING;

               10) LEAVE A THOROUGH RECORD OF WHAT YOU DID WITH THE
                  M.A.R. YOU GIVE YOUR LEAD OPERATOR AND IN THE SYSTEM
                  LOGBOOK.

BASE SAVE DESCRIPTION


       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))
                                      1.

            From time to time the automatic self-recovery of  a  Tymbase  crash
       will  not  occur.  Generally if portions of the base code are clobbered,
       correcting the situation depends on the operator's ability to coordinate
       the  appropriate procedures with TYMNET NETWORK CONTROL.  There are over
       10,000 instructions in a base code.  These instructions can be reflected
       in  the various registers of the minicomputer.  Part of this code is the
       BOOTSTRAP - a series of instructions which the base uses to bring itself
       to a functioning state by loading and running the rest of the code.

            If any type of base crash occurs,  both  hosts  interfacing  TYMNET
       through  that  base  will  crash.   As  with  any host crash, you should
       announce the crash over the loudspeaker.  When you see both hosts  on  a
       base  crash  you  should  check that base before bringing up either 940.
       Generally the Tymbase will have already dumped it's code into  940  core
       and  the  hosts  can  be  brought  back up.  When you load the TYMCOM-IX
       monitor with 'UP;G' the crash code will be saved to a  special  area  on
       disk  0.   Then the 2CRASHSAVE program (during OPCOM) will include it in
       the crash save files.

                                      2.

            If however, the base is unable to recover, then all logins  to  the
       host  will  fail  and  the message 'HOST NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH NET' will
       type out.  By this time, the operator should have  begun  to  suspect  a
       base  problem  requiring manual intervention.  When the base crashes and
       is not able to restart itself the machine will either be in 'STEP' (that
       is  the  STEP  light will be lit and there will be no activity in any of
       the register lights) or the machine will be hung up in a loop (in  which
       case  the  lights  on  the  console will not be flickering).  Additional
       symptoms of a non-recovering base crash can be  obtained  by  using  the
       PROBE  program  to  check the status of the base from the vantage of the
       network supervisor.  This program is documented in  another  section  of
       this manual.



                                         NOTE

           For the following description you are referred  to  the  console
           diagram on the page after next.


                                                                        Page 16
BASE SAVE DESCRIPTION


                                      3.


            The first recovery procedure is to turn the console enable  key  to
       the  'ON' position to 'unlock' the 620L-100 console.  If the base is not
       is STEP, press the 'STEP' key to stop the machine from looping.

                                      4.

            At this  point  you  should  record  the  contents  of  the  base's
       registers.   To  do this on the 620 L-100 type base (TYMCOM-IX) you must
       push each of the register switches (labeled from right to left)  'P,  U,
       A,  B  and X to the down position one at a time.  When each switch is in
       the down position, the contents of that register will be displayed as an
       octal  number  in  the data lights labeled (right to left) 0 through 15.
       This information should be recorded in  the  form  'P=NNNNNN,  U=NNNNNN'
       etc.

                                      5.

            Once you have recorded all of the registers one at a time,  proceed
       to  clear each register.  To do this put each individual register in the
       down position, press the BIT RESET button, and then put the register key
       back  to the up position.  When the BIT RESET button is pushed the light
       in the data display will reset to 0 (all lights out).  Proceed with  the
       same  procedure  with the next register and continue until all registers
       have been cleared.

            Next attempt to restart the base from P location  0.   To  do  this
       press  the  SYSTEM RESET button twice and then the RUN button.  The code
       should now be running.  A restart from P location 0  dumps  the  Tymbase
       into  940  core  on both hosts connected to the base.  If this procedure
       succeeds the lights in the data display will begin to flicker,  and  the
       RUN light should remain on.

            It always takes at least two minutes for a  restarted  base  to  be
       recognized  by  the network.  You should use the PROBE program to verify
       that the base has restarted correctly.  If  so,  proceed  to  bring  the
       hosts back up.
                                                                        Page 17

                                      6.

            If restarting the code from 0 fails, chances are the base  will  go
       into  step.  If that happens, or if the network does not acknowledge the
       base restart within PROBE after 3 minutes, the next corrective procedure
       is  to  contact  TYMNET NETWORK CONTROL (408 446-6180 or ext.  6468) and
       request that  they  force  the  base  to  it's  appropriate  synchronous
       bootstrap  location,  load  a fresh copy of basecode from downstream and
       start it running.  Base code for the 940's is contained in diskfiles  on
       either  system  33  or system 36 under directory (TYMNET).  Under normal
       situations, this code can be loaded over TYMNET so long  as  both  hosts
       are  down and the base is in the network.  However, at this point, it is
       assumed that the base is in step, that the registers have been  recorded
       (step  4  above)  and  cleared  (step 5 above) and that you have already
       tried the less drastic measure of restarting the Tymbase from  P=0.   If
       both  hosts  are  not yet down, use breakpoint 4 to crash them.  Contact
       NETWORK CONTROL and find out which network line from the  base  will  be
       used  for  the  downstream  code load.  If they indicate the current net
       line set up for the base load, go over to  the  base  and  put  the  'P'
       register  key  down.   Enter an octal 37640 into the data display.  When
       you have done this hit the SYSTEM RESET  button  twice,  then  hit  RUN.
       From this point, NETCON can proceed with the reload.

                                     NOTE

       The bootstrap start location above reflects  a  620  with  16K  of  core
       (standard).  If however the 620 has

               12K of core    use     P=27640
               20K of core    use     P=47640
               24K of core    use     P=57640

                                      7.

            If however, NETCON indicates that some line other than the  current
       line  will  be used for the downstream code load, you will have to check
       and possibly change the contents of  five  locations  in  the  bootstrap
       before  proceeding  to  start  the  synchronous boot.  The locations and
       contents to be changed in these cases are listed below.

            This table can also be used to determine which  line  is  currently
       set  up  for the downstream load.  For example, if you check the 16k 620
       value of bootstrap location 37655 and find it contains 50040, then  line
       0 (the default) is the current line setting for the code load.

            The table below contains the  appropriate  locations  and  contents
       necessary to load basecode downstream from various network lines.  Refer
       to the procedure under ERRORS AND  RECOVERIES  for  details  on  how  to
       examine and change these locations.

            If the base reload fails you may have to manually reload  the  base
       bootstrap;   The  procedure  for  this  is  detailed  in  the ERRORS AND
       RECOVERIES section of this document.

                                      8.

            If this base load was a success, the the initial evidence  is  that
       the  RUN  and OVFL lights stay on and the data display lights (esp.  bit
       10) flicker faintly.  Conclusive evidence of a  successful  base  reload
       comes  from  checking the status of the base node you just reloaded with
       the PROBE program.  Remember, it will take  the  Network  Supervisor  at
       lease 2 minutes to recognize the base again.

                                      9.

            If this procedure has succeeded, you can proceed to bring  up  both
       940s  for  timesharing  by typing UP;G to the selector channel DIM.  The
       dumped base crash will then be saved with the crash dump.

                                      10.

       ((ERRORS and RECOVERIES))

            Although the 620 bootstrap seldom gets clobbered, a  bad  bootstrap
       is  the  most common reason for a base reload not working properly:  the
       mechanism for moving code from 940 core to 620 where it can run will  be
       disabled  if  any  part of the bootstrap is incorrect.  To identify this
       problem it is necessary to check the current bootstrap in the  620L-100.
       If  any  instruction(s)  is found to deviate from the correct entry, the
       instruction(s) involved must be manually changed to the  correct  value.
       Before   outlining   these  techniques,  a  few  basic  definitions  are
       presented:

               P REGISTER             The P register is the program 
                                       location counter. This
                                       program counter is 16 bits long.

               U REGISTER             The U register is the instruction
                                       register of the CPU; 16 bits.

               A REGISTER             The A register is the accumulator
                                       register and is also 16 bits;
                                       the contents of a location are
                                       usually here.

               014000                  this is the 'LOAD A' register
                                       instruction; 10000 is 'load a'
                                       and 4000 is 'relative to the 'p'
                                       register. Use this to check.

               054000                  this is the 'STORE A' register
                                       instruction; 50000 is 'store a'
                                       and 4000 is 'relative to the 'p'
                                       register'. use this to correct.
                                                                        Page 21
CHECKING/RELOADING THE BOOTSTRAP


                        ((RELOADING SYNCHRONOUS BOOTS))

            With  the  downstream  loader,  the  bootstrap  used  is  called  a
       'synchronous'  boot;   if  it  should  fail,  you can reload it by first
       loading the older 'system' bootstrap for the 620.

       a) use the selector channel mode on the terminal to type  UP;G  to  DIM;
       if  you must do this remember to use UP-1;G when bringing up the host so
       you will avoid overwriting the original crash dump.

       b) to the prompt 'HOST:' you should type whichever host number is host 0
       (the first number on the base label - eg.  C5 for C5-20B);

       c) to the 'LOC.:' prompt, type 11 (or 14)  to  load  the  file  (TYMNET)
       SYNCLD;  this is the 'system' boot;

       d) on the 620 hit the reset key twice;

       e) set the 620 sense switches to indicate the octal number  of  the  net
       line that will be used by NETCON for the downstream load;

       f) finally, hit RUN on the 620 to start the  synchronous  boot;   NETCON
       can resume with the actual base code load at this point.

                          ((CHECKING THE BOOTSTRAP))

       1) THE 620L-100 MUST BE IN 'STEP';  IF NOT HIT 'STEP'.

       2) CLEAR ALL THE REGISTERS (SEE STEP 5 IN THE COMMAND DESCRIPTION  ABOVE
       ON HOW TO DO THIS).

       3) SET THE 'REPEAT' KEY ON;  SELECT THE 'U' REGISTER  AND  ENTER  14000;
       SELECT  THE  'P'  REGISTER AND ENTER 37640 (OR WHICHEVER THE LOCATION IS
       YOU WISH TO CHECK).  NEXT SELECT THE 'A' REGISTER.

       4) GET A  HARDCOPY  OF  THE  CORRECT  BOOTSTRAP  LISTING  OR  THE  TABLE
       CONTAINING  THE  FIVE  LOCATIONS  INVOLVED IN DETERMINING WHICH NET LINE
       WILL BE USED FOR THE DOWNSTREAM BASE LOAD.  HIT 'STEP' AND THE ENTRY FOR
       THAT  LOCATION  IN  THE CURRENT BASE BOOTSTRAP WILL BE SHOWN AS AN OCTAL
       NUMBER IN THE DATA DISPLAY.  IF YOU ARE CHECKING THE  ENTIRE  BOOTSTRAP,
       THIS  SHOULD MATCH THE FIRST OCTAL ENTRY ON YOUR LIST.  FOR CHECKING THE
       FIVE LOCATIONS INVOLVED IN NET LINE FOR THE LOAD, THIS SHOULD MATCH  THE
       APPROPRIATE  VALUE  CONTAINED IN THE LINE TABLE IN THIS DOCUMENT.  IF IT
       IS NOT CORRECT, MARK THAT LOCATION ON YOUR HARDCOPY SO  THAT  LATER  YOU
       CAN CHANGE THAT ENTRY IN THE 620L-100 BOOTSTRAP.

       5) TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT  INSTRUCTION  IN  THE  BOOTSTRAP,  HIT  'STEP'
       AGAIN.   THIS  WILL  INCREMENT  THE  'P'  REGISTER  AND DISPLAY THE NEXT
       BOOTSTRAP ENTRY IN THE DATA LIGHTS.   REPEAT  THE  COMPARISON  WITH  THE
       BOOTSTRAP LISTING AND MAKE A MARK IF THE 620 ENTRY IS INCORRECT.  IF YOU
       WISH TO CHECK THE ENTIRE BOOTSTRAP, TO DO THIS PROCEED TO  DISPLAY  EACH
       SUCCESSIVE ENTRY IN THE BOOTSTRAP BY HITTING 'STEP'.
                                                                        Page 22
CHECKING/RELOADING THE BOOTSTRAP


                       ((CORRECTING A BOOTSTRAP ENTRY))

       6) NOW, REFERRING  TO  THE  INCORRECT  ENTRIES  YOU'VE  CHECKED  ON  THE
       BOOTSTRAP  LIST,  (OR, TO THE LIST OF THE FIVE LOCATIONS THAT NEED TO BE
       MODIFIED TO LOAD FROM A NET LINE OTHER THAN THE  CURRENT  LINE  SETTING)
       SELECT  THE 'U' REGISTER AND ENTER 54000;  NEXT, SELECT THE 'P' REGISTER
       AND ENTER WHICHEVER BOOTSTRAP LOCATION CONTAINS THE ENTRY  YOU  WISH  TO
       CHANGE;   SELECT  THE  'A'  REGISTER.  HIT 'BIT RESET' TO CLEAR THE DATA
       DISPLAY LIGHTS.

       7) INTO THE 'A' REGISTER YOU SHOULD KEYIN  THE  CORRECT  ENTRY  FOR  THE
       LOCATION  THAT IS IN THE 'P' REGISTER.  NOW HIT 'STEP' ONCE.  REPEAT THE
       PROCEDURES 6 AND 7 FOR EACH ENTRY YOU NEED TO CHANGE.

       8) WHEN ALL THE APPROPRIATE ENTRIES HAVE  BEEN  MADE,  RECHECK  ALL  THE
       CHANGES  (WITH  PROCEDURES  1  THRU  5)  TO  MAKE  SURE THE 620L-100 NOW
       CONTAINS THE EXACT SAME ENTRY FOR EACH  LOCATION  AS  YOU  HAVE  ON  THE
       BOOTSTRAP LIST OR LINE TABLE.

       9) IF NOT, REDO THIS ENTIRE PROCEDURE UNTIL THE  BOOTSTRAP  IS  CORRECT;
       IF  IT  IS  CORRECT, YOU CAN PROCEED TO RESTART THE BOOTSTRAP AND NOTIFY
       NETCON TO RESUME THE BASE CODE LOAD AGAIN.


            Occasionally when a power failure takes the base down, the 620L-100
       may  be in a 'pwr checked' mode.  The key on the console would be on but
       none of the front panel switches would work.  If so,  turn  the  key  to
       'OFF', then back to 'PWR ON'.

            If none of the above procedures correct  a  base  problem,  contact
       TYMSHARE MAINTENANCE for assistance.

PROBE


                          PROBE ON THE INTERDATA 7/32
                          ----- -- --- --------- ----

       ((INTRODUCTION))

            PROBE is the access and control program for the TYMNET  supervisor.
       It  is  a  major  subsystem which runs on the Interdata model 7/32.  The
       primary operator functions in PROBE are:

               1) to determine the general status of the network;

               2) to check on the status of individual nodes in the net
                  especially if it becomes necessary to reload a node
                  or move a host from one hardware to another;

               3) to establish a central logger terminal which can
                  extract information of interest to operations about
                  all the systems in an entire computer center.

            In addition,  PROBE  can  be  used  to  manipulate  the  useage  of
       individual  nodes  and  long lines, move the network supervisor from one
       Interdata  to  another,  and  perform  other  activities  vital  to  the
       maintenance of TYMNET.  For the most part, these additional capabilities
       are within the domain of  TYMNET  NETWORK  CONTROL  CENTER  and  require
       special  status.   It  is imperative that NETWORK CONTROL be involved as
       much as possible in any of these other procedures.

       ((COMMAND SUMMARY))

               1) LOGIN TO PROBE ON THE ACTIVE SUPERVISOR;

               2) NEXT ENTER THE NAME WCO AND THE CURRENT OPER PASSWORD;

               3) TYPE THE PROBE COMMAND 'STATUS';

                    (A. NODE CHECKING - N IS A NODE NUMBER)
                    ---------------------------------------

               A4) TYPE THE COMMAND 'HOST N' TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF
                   THAT HOST (EG. 'HOST 38')

               A5) TYPE 'NODE N' FOR ADDITIONAL INFO ON THAT NODE;

               A6) QUIT THE PROGRAM AND LOGOUT OF THE INTERDATA WITH
                   THE 'EXIT' COMMAND.

                   TYPE 'EXTRACT 701' FOR CUPC CHECKING.

                                                                        Page 24
PROBE OPERATION


                                    STARTUP

            The first person to login to PROBE after the 7/32 has been  brought
       up  will  be  asked  to  supply  Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in the format
       DD:HH:MM where DD is the number of days since the begining of the  year.
       When  the  TYMNET  clock  is  installed,  this function will normally be
       handled by the TYMNET clock.  By typing a control  Q  here  the  program
       will skip the date input and prompt for login.

                                     LOGIN

            All Interdata supervisors will run on "host"  systems  120  through
       127.  The following are valid ways of getting into PROBE:

                       PROBE:127;(password);
                       PROBE:*;(password)cr

            The asterisk (*) refers to the currently active supervisor.


                                         NOTE

           One may end the PROBE password  with  a  semicolon  or  carriage
           return, but not both.



            After the circuit has been built to the 7/32, PROBE will ask for an
       additional  username.   You  should  use WCO as the username.  After the
       name has been entered, PROBE will ask for the password.   This  password
       is the same for WCO as the login password for OPER on Tymshare hosts.

                                 COMMAND MODE

            Whenever a colon appears on the left hand margin, PROBE is ready to
       accept another command.

            All PROBE commands must be typed out in full on one line and  ended
       with a carriage return.

            To get back to PROBE command mode (after login has been  completed)
       type  a  control  Q or escape.  This will abort the current activity and
       return to command mode.
                                                                        Page 25
GENERAL PROBE COMMANDS


                  COMMANDS WHICH INVOLVE GENERAL INFORMATION
                  -------- ----- ------- ------- -----------

       HELP (or H, or ?)

       Refers user to the document file PROBE.DOC.

       SEND J MESSAGE 

       This sends a message to the user on job j.  Use the WHO command to  find
       out the proper job label.

       SYS 

       Type out host, or system number.

       TIME 

       Type out the current time.

       WHO 

       The WHO command lists the current PROBE users and their job labels.  The
       joblabels are needed for the SEND and HANG commands.

       VERSION 

       Print out the version numbers of PROBE, the kernel, and the supervisor.

       EXIT

       This command quits the PROBE program and logs out of the INTERDATA 7/32.
                                                                        Page 26
TYMNET STATUS COMMANDS


                  COMMANDS WHICH INVOLVE THE STATUS OF TYMNET
                  -------- ----- ------- --- ------ -- ------

       STAT 

       This command prints out the numbers of nodes in each of the  5  takeover
       states,  the  df (see below), and the reject count.  The reject count is
       the count of the number of  times  the  supervisor  could  not  build  a
       circuit  because  of  shut lines, lines out of channels, or nodes out of
       passthroughs.  The source and destination nodes  of  the  last  rejected
       login attempt are printed after the reject count.  If SUP is not running
       (neither awake nor asleep) the kernel's Status will appear at the end of
       the first line.  The kernel status may be interpreted as follows:

               NUMBER  MEANING
               ------  -------
        1000    FROZEN BY OPERATOR
         800    PARITY ERROR IN THE SUPERVISOR - OR JOE RINDE HAS
                STOPPED THE SUPERVISOR FOR EXAMINATION
         100    SUPERVISOR HAS FAILED TO RECOVER FROM A CRASH - THE
                SUPERVISOR CODE AREA HAS PROBABLY BEEN CLOBBERED.

       COUNT 

       This counts the number of nodes, terminations, and passthroughs  in  the
       net.  It does not count internal circuits as terminations.

       DF (NUMBER) (Requires Status 01)

       This is used to compute the drowsiness factor.  When a  supervisor  goes
       to  sleep  or  otherwise  fails  to  send  'sleeping  pills',  the other
       supervisor systems will remain dormant for only the  number  of  seconds
       they  are  supposed  to  remain  asleep  based  on  their ranking in the
       'supervisor pecking order'.  The drowsiness factor is a number  that  is
       factored  into  this.   1000  decimal is the largest number that one may
       enter.  This has the effect of suppressing the supervisor.

       AWAKE (Requires Status 01)

       This command will awaken the supervisor immediately.  This overrides all
       previous reasons for sleeping, including a large DF (Drowsiness Factor -
       how long the supervisor in question will remain dormant when  an  active
       supervisor goes to 'sleep'.

       SLEEP (Requires Status 01)

       Put the current active supervisor to sleep.

       LSHUT 

       List all the shut lines.
                                                                        Page 27
NODE COMMANDS


                  COMMANDS WHICH INVOLVE THE STATUS OF NODES
                  -------- ----- ------- --- ------ -- -----

       CT NODE 

       This command traces all circuits terminating at  this  node.   All  port
       numbers are in decimal.

       CP NODE 

       This traces all circuits passing through this node.

       CL NODE LINE 

       Use this to trace all circuits on this line.

       HOST 

       This command types information about a host or hosts.  If  for  example,
       you  type  'HOST  19'  PROBE  types  info  about  host  19.  If you type
       'HOST'(CR), the program types info about all hosts.  The info  typed  is
       host  number,  down,  shut or answered, position number on its base, and
       base number.

       AN 

       This command will type out node number, version number, host numbers (if
       any), terminations (not counting internal circuits), passthroughs, crash
       count, upstream node number, and downstream node number for all nodes in
       the net.

       AD 

       This will list all down nodes including those nodes  which  are  not  in
       net, but are known by nodes which are in the net.

       EXC 

       List lines which are out or in some other exceptional state.

       N

       N is short for node.  see below.

       NODE NODE 

       This  will  give  version  number,  crash  count,  upstream   direction,
       downstream  direction,  and  exceptional conditions for this node.  This
       command will also provide the number of passthroughs  and  terminations.
       If the node is a base it will give host numbers and status of each host.
       Hosts will appear in order of position  on  base  (0  or  1).   neighbor
       number, number of groups, cost of using line, and exceptional conditions
       for each line will be output.
                                                                        Page 28
NODE COMMANDS


       NEIGHBOR NODE 

       This will scan node descriptors of all nodes to find references  to  the
       specified node.  Output from this command includes the node number, line
       number, and number of groups for the neighbor of the specified node.

       RETAKE NODE (Requires Status 20)

       This instructs the supervisor to retake the node.

       BORI node LINE (Requires Status 20)

       This tells a node to reset it's BORI header (Beginning Of Record Input).

       ESHUT NODE NODE (Requires Status 10)

       This will make an entry to the supervisor's shut line table.  The effect
       is  to shut the line between the specified nodes.  This can also be done
       by using the 1DOWN program.

       RSHUT NODE NODE (Requires Status 10)

       Use this command to remove a shut between these two nodes.

       CLEAR NODE (Requires Status 10)

       This removes all line shuts involving the specified node.

       NSHUT NODE (Requires Status 10)

       This puts a shut in all lines on the specified node.
                                                                        Page 29
PROBE EXTRACT


               COMMANDS WHICH EXTRACT INFORMATION TO THE LOGGER
               -------- ----- ------- ----------- -- --- ------

       EXTRACT NODE NODELIST

            EXTRACT will generate current log reports from  certain  nodes  and
       provide  messages of interest to operations such as 'HOST DOWN', 'OUT OF
       DBITS' and so on.  To specify  all  relevant  bases  within  a  computer
       center, a code may be typed:

               CUPERTINO BUILDING A    700
               CUPERTINO BUILDING C    701
               PALO ALTO               702
               HOUSTON                 703
               VALLEY FORGE            704

            The format of this PROBE command is 'EXTRACT NODE NODE LIST'.   For
       example if you type 'EXTRACT 1 701, this will report data from all bases
       in Cupertino C plus base 1.  If you type 'EXTRACT 703' the program  will
       report  only  information on SCO - Tymshare's computer center in Houston
       Texas.

       LOG TIME

            The 'LOG TIME' command starts the logger output of all or specified
       information  on  all  hosts,  lines and nodes in the network.  The valid
       formats to this command are:

            The PROBE LOG command  will  allow  the  option  of  single  letter
       qualifiers  which  modify  what  information  will be output and in what
       format.  The S qualifier instructs the program to print a  time  to  the
       nearest  second with each record output.  If the qualifier H is used all
       records output will be in  hexadecimal.   The  other  qualifiers  are  D
       (Disable) and X (eXceptions only).  The D qualifier will ignore nonfatal
       errors, bad records, and certain undecoded errors.  The X qualifier will
       print  out  only  host and line related information (Line Out, Reset, or
       OK, Host Up, Down, Answered, or  Shut,  Host  Unhappy  bits).   The  'X'
       qualifier will override a D qualifier.

       ((ERRORS AND RECOVERIES))

            As mentioned earlier, all PROBE commands must be typed in full.  In
       general  if  an  operand  is  ommitted the program will assume 'ALL' was
       intended.  Any command can be aborted by using the Control Q or 'ESCAPE'
       key.

            Regarding login errors, the most common has  been  forgetting  that
       the password typein must be terminated by EITHER a CR or a semicolon (;)
       but NOT BOTH.  If you type both the program will assume the CR was  part
       of  the  probe  user  input and will loop with this incorrect input.  In
       cases where the login was correct but the message 'PLEASE LOG IN' occurs
       instead  of  being  logged  into the INTERDATA, the most likely cause is
       that there  are  no  available  job  slots  remaining  on  the  machine.
       Currently  there  are 12 available slots and often many of these must be
       used in the field while corrective maintenance occurs on the net.

TELECOPY


                       TELECOPY - MOVING FILES ON TYMNET
                       --------   ------ ----- -- ------



       ((INTRODUCTION))

            TELECOPY is a file transfer program used to copy files between  two
       Tymshare  host  computer  systems.   It can copy any type of files to or
       from similar systems (ie.  one TYMCOM-X to another TYMCOM-X) and it  now
       has  the  ability to transfer files in other modes to and from different
       types of hosts (ie.  TYMCOM-X to TYMCOM-IX).


                                         NOTE

           For information on these capabilities, you are referred  to  the
           TYMCOM-X file (*6NEWS)TELECO.INF on any TYMCOM-X.


            In all cases, the conventions and protocols of the systems involved
       must  be followed.  For example, on the TYMCOM-IX, the maximum allowable
       file size is the same for TELECOPY as it is for the EXEC command 'COPY'.
       Also,  the  file naming conventions must meet the syntax requirements on
       both the sending and the receiving systems.

            To copy files between systems with this program,  it  is  necessary
       that  the  same  username  be valid on both the originating host and the
       destination host.  It is best to TELECOPY files from one username  on  a
       system  to  the  same username on the other system.  Files can be copied
       either from or to the system the user is currently logged on, but he/she
       must  be  logged  in to one of the two systems involved in the TELECOPY.
       For example, if the user is logged into C33, he/she cannot telecopy from
       H8 to C38.
                                                                        Page 33
TELECOPY SUMMARY


       ((COMMAND SUMMARY))


            When TELECOPY is ready to accept commands from the terminal, a  ":"
       prompt is printed.  The following commands are implemented:

       RUn
                           Begins program execution.   Will  prompt  for  "copy
                           from" filename and "copy to" filename.  When entered
                           from the RUN command, filenames must be specified in
                           full with only one filename per line in form:

                           (username:sysno)filename

       VErsion
                           Prints the controller version number.

       ONlc
                           Allows lower case to appear in  ASCII  transmission.
                           Unless  this  command  is issued, lower case will be
                           converted to  upper  case  when  transferring  files
                           between dissimilar operating systems.

       OFlc
                           Turns   off   lower   case   (default   for    ASCII
                           transmission).

       Truncate (length)
                           Affects ASCII transmission from TYMCOM 370 to TYMCOM
                           X  or TYMCOM IX.  {length} must be an integer from 2
                           to 255.  Indicates that TYMCOM 370 files  should  be
                           truncated  starting at the specified column in order
                           to delete sequence numbers.   Usually,  this  option
                           must  be  specified when a file has sequence numbers
                           before SUPRESS will have any useful effect.

       No Truncate
                           Turns off truncate feature of TYMCOM 370.   This  is
                           the default setting.

       SUppress
                           Affects ASCII transmission from TYMCOM 370 to TYMCOM
                           X  or  TYMCOM  IX.   Causes  trailing  blanks  to be
                           discarded   from   TYMCOM   370   records,   greatly
                           shortening  transmission  time  and  the size of the
                           target file.  This is the default setting.

       No Suppress
                           Stops the removal of trailing blanks by  the  TYMCOM
                           370.
                                                                        Page 34
TELECOPY SUMMARY


       Fixed [frecl]
                           Causes a TYMCOM 370  to  create  fixed  length  file
                           records  of  length  [frecl]  where  [frecl]  is  an
                           integer not to exceed 65536.  If [frecl] is omitted,
                           then  frecl=80  is assumed.  The TYMCOM 370 will use
                           blanks to pad the records it receives to the desired
                           length.

       VAriable [vrecl]
                           Causes a TYMCOM 370 to create variable  length  file
                           records  of  maximum length [vrecl] where [vrecl] is
                           an integer not to exceed  65536.   When  [vrecl]  is
                           omitted,  65536  is assumed, and the default setting
                           of this switch is such  that  the  TYMCOM  370  will
                           create  variable  length  records  of maximum length
                           65536 unless the FIXED option has been set.

                       { Native }
                       { Serial }
       Mode {[Transmit]  Binary [BLocking= N1] [Fill= Left] [BYtesize= N2]}
            {[Receive ]                        [Fill= Right]              }
                        { Ascii }
                        { Katakana }
                        { Image }

                           This  command  is   used   to   force   setting   of
                           transmission mode to other than the program default.
                           In the case of BINARY mode, parameters  may  be  set
                           differently  for  the  transmitter  (file donor) and
                           receiver.  N1 is the number of bytes  to  be  packed
                           (unpacked)per  machine  word.   N1 must be between 1
                           and 16.  n2 is the bytesize in bits,  and  must  lie
                           between  1  and  8 inclusive.  When FILL=LEFT, bytes
                           are packed left justified and  unused  bits  to  the
                           right are zeroed.  When FILL=RIGHT, bytes are packed
                           right justified and the more  significant  bits  are
                           zeroed.

                           SERIAL, NATIVE, and IMAGE are all special  cases  of
                           binary  transmission which have been given their own
                           names.    When   BLOCKING,   FILL,   and    BYTESIZE
                           specifications  are  all  omitted  from  the  BINARY
                           parameter list, BINARY becomes equivalent to  SERIAL
                           mode.

                           ASCII and KATAKANA modes  are  nearly  identical  in
                           their  character  sets  and  are subject to the same
                           option switches.

TELECOPY SUMMARY


                { Off }
       Compress { Duplicate }
                { Rank [Auto]}

                           This  command  forces  the  setting  of   the   data
                           compression   method   to  other  than  the  program
                           default.  Compression may be disabled altogether  by
                           specifying  OFF.   The  AUTO  option  of RANK causes
                           TELECOPY to decide for itself  whether  to  use  the
                           RANK or the DUPLICATE method.

       SCratch
                           This  command  clears  all  user-supplied  MODE  and
                           COMPRESS   switches   so  that  the  normal  program
                           defaults will be reinstated.

       Talk [sysno]
                           This command builds a TYMNET circuit to  the  system
                           number  given  by  integer  [sysno].   If [sysno] is
                           omitted, an existing circuit will  be  used  if  one
                           exists.   Once the circuit has been established, the
                           logged in userid begins to accrue usage charges just
                           as if the userid had logged directly into the remote
                           system with his  terminal.   Input  from  the  local
                           terminal  is  passed along to the remote system, and
                           its  terminal  output  is  directed  to  the   local
                           terminal,  allowing  the  user  to converse with the
                           remote system.  This feature will be needed  to  use
                           TELECOPY  when  the  logged-in  userid has a PROFILE
                           EXEC  or  inititialized  file  that  asks  questions
                           before  proceeding  to the system command level.  It
                           is also useful for modifying the environment at  the
                           remote system prior to file transfer.

                           TALK mode may be exited by  typing  %%F(cr)  at  the
                           local terminal.  A %%U(cr) sends a unit separator to
                           the remote  system.   Escapes  typed  at  the  local
                           terminal will be sent to the remote system.

                           Due to the difference in echoing rules of the TYMCOM
                           370  and  the  TYMCOM  IX  or  X,  echo is currently
                           doubled by a TYMCOM IX or X system, and  type-a-head
                           is not supported.

TELECOPY SUMMARY


                           When connection is made to a TYMCOM X or TYMCOM  370
                           via  the  TALK  command, the possibility exists that
                           the user may be detached for up to 1/2 hour  if  the
                           circuit  is  broken.   The recommended procedure for
                           breaking such a circuit is to use the  TALK  command
                           and  to  send a LOGOUT command to the remote system.
                           The  warning  message  "CIRCUIT  REMAINS  TO  SYSTEM
                           xx--USE  TALK  COMMAND  TO  LOGOUT" will be given by
                           TELECOPY prior to breaking the TYMNET circuit.   The
                           QUIT command will ask a user if he wishes to exit if
                           a TALK connection  to  a  TYMCOM  X  or  TYMCOM  370
                           exists.

       Loquacious
                           This command causes checkpoint and other messages to
                           be printed on the terminal during program execution.
                           Information  about  modes  selected   and   progress
                           reports  are given.  The progress reports are useful
                           when copying very large files.

       Not Loquacious
                           Stops printing of checkpoint information.   This  is
                           the default setting.

       Ask
                           This command will cause TELECOPY to require a 'Y' or
                           'N'  confirmation  before  copying  over an existing
                           file.  This is the default mode of operation.

       REplace
                           This command will cause TELECOPY to  copy  over  any
                           existing   files   without  requiring  confirmation.
                           TELECOPY will print "REPLACING FILE ..."  when  this
                           option is in effect and a file is to be overwritten.

       Keep
                           This command will cause TELECOPY to  bypass  copying
                           over    an    existing   file,   without   requiring
                           confirmation.  TELECOPY  will  print  "KEEPING  FILE
                           ..."  when  this option is in effect and an existing
                           file was specified to be overwritten.

TELECOPY SUMMARY


       Update
                           This command  will  force  TELECOPY  to  update  the
                           contents  of an old file being replaced, rather than
                           copy an entire file.  This is the  default  setting.
                           Effective  only  for  BINARY, SERIAL, or NATIVE mode
                           file  transfers  between  TELECOPY  controllers  and
                           slaves  which  have  UPDATE capability (that is, all
                           except TYMCOM 370).

       No Update
                           Forces copying the entire contents of a file even if
                           UPDATE  mode  could  have  been used.  May be faster
                           than UPDATE mode if the old file being replaced  has
                           been   modified   sequentially   starting  near  the
                           beginning, or greatly differs from the replacement.

TELECOPY DESCRIPTION


       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))

            To start the program, enter the following  program  name  from  the
       exec:

               On TYMCOM-IX  hosts            'TELECOPY'
               On TYMCOM-X   hosts            'R TELECO'
               On TYMCOM-370 hosts            'TELECOPY'

       The program responds with a colon (:) prompt at which point the user may
       enter  any  valid  TELECOPY command.  If any of the preliminary commands
       are needed to establish parameters relevant to the  use  of  lower  case
       characters, trailing blanks and so on, they should be input first.

            As a user with Tymshare license, you may receive  progress  reports
       periodically  by  using  the  'TIME'  command at this point.  It is only
       necessary to do this once to set the switch.  This will also report  the
       rate per second characters are being transferred.

            there are two ways to begin program execution.   the  first  is  to
       issue  the  run command, which will prompt for the "copy from" and "copy
       to" filenames as shown in the following example:

       ':RUN (CR)

       'COPY FROM FILE:' (YOUNGERC:38)TELECO.RNO(cr)

       'COPY TO FILE:' (YOUNGERC:33)TELECO.RNO(cr)

       'COPY STARTING'

       '(YOUNGERC:38)TELECO.RNO COPIED TO (YOUNGERC:33)TELECO.RNO'
       '32000 (26454) CHARS. TRANSMITTED'

       ':'

       Only one file can be specified for transfer  when  the  RUN  command  is
       used.   The  filename must be preceded by the username and system number
       which complete the path name for the file.  The syntax for  both  "FROM"
       and "TO" pathnames is:

            (username:{sysno})filename
                      { *   }

       The filename that is typed must obey the syntax rules on its  respective
       system.

       An asterisk "*" may be used in place  of  the  system  number  on  which
       TELECOPY  is  being  run.   The  system nos.  in the "FROM" and the "TO"
       specifications must not the same system, and at least one of  them  must
       be the system on which TELECOPY is being run.

            In the example above, if the file TELECO.RNO already existed on the
       destination system and was to be replaced, TELECOPY would have printed

       'OK TO WRITE ON OLD FILE? '
                                                                        Page 40
TELECOPY DESCRIPTION


       In order to require confirmation of the replacement.  This question must
       be  answered  YES  or  NO.   If  the answer is YES, and file transfer is
       between identical system types (except TYMCOM 370's),  or  is  a  binary
       mode  transfer  between dissimilar system types (but neither is a TYMCOM
       370), then TELECOPY will switch to UPDATE mode and send only  blocks  of
       the  donor  file  which  differ from blocks in the destination file.  In
       this case, TELECOPY would have printed "'UPDATING STARTED'"  instead  of
       "'COPY STARTED'".

            Two commands, REPLACE and KEEP, may be used  to  provide  automatic
       confirmation  or rejection, respectively, of file replacement.  The KEEP
       command, for example, will cause TELECOPY to retain any  existing  files
       that  would  otherwise  have  been written over.  Still another command,
       ASK, restores  the  normal  mode  of  requiring  confirmation  from  the
       terminal.  These commands are useful when creating commands files and it
       is uncertain whether the files being copied  will  need  a  'Y'  or  'N'
       response in the commands file.

            When TELECOPY has finished  copying  the  file,  it  will  print  a
       message   to   this   effect,   including   complete   "FROM"  and  "TO"
       specifications.   TELECOPY  also  prints  the  total  number  of   8-bit
       characters  transfered,  and the number of TYMNET characters transmitted
       in parentheses.


            The second, and prefered, method of beginning program execution  is
       to  type  the  "FROM"  and  "TO" filename specifications directly at the
       prompting ":".  When the command dispatcher sees a left  parentheses  as
       the first character of any command, a RUN is implied and extended syntax
       rules apply.  The format for this command line is

       "FROM"specifications[,]"TO"specifications(cr)

       The comma separating "FROM" and "TO" specifications  is  optional.   The
       "TO"  specifications  will  be recognized by the presence of a colon ":"
       somewhere in the "TO" system no.  specification.

            The total length of the line cannot exceed 300 chars.   A  linefeed
       may be used to continue typing the line.

                             "FROM" SPECIFICATIONS

       (username[:{sysno}])filename1[,filename2[,...]]
                [:{ *   }]

            A number of  filenames  belonging  to  the  same  username  may  be
       specified.   If  the  system no.  and its preceding colon ":" is omitted
       altogether, ":*" is assumed (the system on which TELECOPY is run).

                              "TO" SPECIFICATIONS

       [(username]:{sysno}[)][filename1[,filename2[,...]]]
                   { *   }

       If the "to" username is omitted, the "FROM" username  is  assumed.   The
       "TO" system number and its preceding colon ":" may never be omitted.  If
                                                                        Page 41
TELECOPY DESCRIPTION


       fewer filenames are listed in the "TO" specifications than appear in the
       list   of   "FROM"   filenames,  then  the  name  given  in  the  "FROM"
       specifications  is  assumed.   The  "TO"  filenames   may   be   omitted
       altogether,  and  then  all files specified on the "FROM" system will be
       copied to identical filenames on the "TO" system.

                        TYMCOM-IX SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
                       --------- -------- -------------

            The following  differences  prevail  when  using  this  program  to
       transfer files from or to a TYMCOM-IX and another type of host:

            ASCII files may be transferred, and to a lesser degree of  success,
       SERIAL  binary mode also.  Between the TYMCOM-IX and TYMCOM-X, IMAGE and
       BINARY files can be transferred.  Tymcom-x line numbered files, such  as
       created   with   LINED,   will  have  the  line  numbers  stripped  when
       transferring to the TYMCOM-IX system.  TYMCOM-X tabs will be expanded to
       spaces   based  on  standard  tab  settings  when  transferring  to  the
       TYMCOM-IX.  The  TYMCOM-IX  compressed  blanks  will  be  expanded  when
       transferring   to  the  TYMCOM-X.   File  names  must  meet  the  syntax
       requirements of the appropriate system.

            You are referred to the naming conventions for the TYMCOM-IX in the
       EXECUTIVE MANUAL (May 1976) page 23,24.
                                                                        Page 42
TELECOPY DESCRIPTION


                        TYMCOM-X SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
                        -------- -------- ------------

            The following differences should be borne in mind when  using  this
       program to transfer files between the TYMCOM-X and other host types:

            ASCII files may be transferred, and to a lesser degree of  success,
       SERIAL  binary mode also.  Between the TYMCOM-X and TYMCOM-IX, IMAGE and
       BINARY files can be transferred.  TYMCOM-X line numbered files, such  as
       created with LINED, will have the line numbers stripped when transferred
       to the TYMCOM-IX system.  TYMCOM-IX compressed blanks will  be  expanded
       when transferred to TYMCOM-X.  TYMCOM-X tabs will be converted to spaces
       based on standard tab setting when transferred to the  TYMCOM-IX.   When
       transferring  onto an old file on the TYMCOM-IX, the file will be opened
       in sequential mode, meaning  that  the  old  contents  are  lost.   This
       differs from the TYMCOM-IX transfer where old files are opened in update
       mode.  This means that if the the TELECOPY is aborted by using an escape
       key the original contents of the old file will be preserved.  File names
       must meet the syntax requirements of the recipient system.

            Refer to the Tymshare XEXEC MANUAL (Dec.  1974) page  13,14  for  a
       discussion of valid file names on the TYMCOM-X.

                       TYMCOM-370 SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
                       ---------- -------- ------------

            The following  differences  prevail  when  using  this  program  to
       transfer files from or to a TYMCOM-370 and another type of system:

            ASCII files may be transferred, and to a lesser degree of  success,
       SERIAL  binary mode also.  Between the TYMCOM-370 and TYMCOM-X, KATAKANA
       mode files can be transfered.  TYMCOM-X line  numbered  files,  such  as
       created   with   LINED,   will  have  the  line  numbers  stripped  when
       transferring to the TYMCOM-370 system.  TYMCOM-X tabs will  be  expanded
       to  spaces  based  on  standard  tab  settings  when transferring to the
       TYMCOM-370.  Blank lines in the TYMCOM-X file will cause a record of one
       blank  on the TYMCOM-370, and if the file is returned to the TYMCOM-X by
       a subsequent file transfer, the "SUPRESS" option should be given.   File
       names must meet the syntax requirements of the appropriate system.

            For a discussion of these requirements on the TYMCOM-370, refer  to
       Tymshare's 'CMS REFERENCE MANUAL' (Oct 1974) page 20-22.

TELECOPY DESCRIPTION


                            TELECOPY COMMANDS FILES
                            -------- -------- -----

            On the TYMCOM IX  system,  TELECOPY  input  may  be  taken  from  a
       commands  file;   output  will always be directed to the terminal.  When
       input is from a commands file, questions  requiring  a  YES/NO  type  of
       response  may  not  be  anticipated.   The  user is advised to include a
       replace or keep command at the beginning of his commands file.

            On the TYMCOM X, commands file input may be initiated by creating a
       .TMP  file  containing  the  user  commands.   This file should be named
       XXXTEL.TMP or XXXTEL.COM, where XXX = PJOB number as typed by  the  PJOB
       command,  with  sufficient leading 0's as required.  Several jobs logged
       into the same userid may use different commands files, each with its own
       PJOB number.  To initiate TELECOPY, type:

       -GET (SYS)TELECO

       -REE

            TELECOPY will now begin execution, taking commands from the .TMP or
       .COM file, until it reaches a QUIT command or end-of-file.  Furthermore,
       TELECOPY will run detached if the commands file has the .COM  extension.
       In  this  case,  terminal  output may be found in a commands output file
       named XXXTEL.OUT.  TELECOPY will  continue  to  run  detached  until  it
       reaches a QUIT command or end-of-file, when the job will log itself out.

       'TO' system may also be omitted.

       In this example, the file is transferred to C35 with the same

       are input together on the same line.

TELECOPY ERROR RECOVERY


       ((ERRORS AND RECOVERIES))

            If the error message 'UNABLE TO LOG INTO SYSTEM NN' outputs,  there
       is  a  possibility  that the destination system is unavailable.  To test
       this possibility, login to the destination system.  If  you  can  login,
       proceed  to  'pull'  the  file from the source system.  Another cause of
       this error message is attempting to use  a  different  username  on  one
       system  than  another.   If not, perhaps one of the the usernames is not
       valid on the host system it references.

            For error messages in the form  'UNABLE  TO  OPEN  FILE  FILENAME',
       chances  are  there  is  a protection on the file or directory involved.
       Check this by using the appropriate EXEC commands that  output  file  or
       directory protection status.

            The   error   message   'CIRCUIT   ZAPPED'   indicates    that    a
       telecommunications  problem  occurred  during  the  TELECOPY.   For best
       results, quit out of telecopy and reenter the program to try again.   If
       the  method of old file overwriting was sequential, then the destination
       file is probably gone.
