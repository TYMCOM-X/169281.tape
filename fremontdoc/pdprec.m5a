ONCE DESCRIPTION


                            "ONCE" ON THE TYMCOM-X                            ______ __ ___ ________

       DESCRIPTION       ___________

            When the system is loaded, the name of the monitor and time of  its
       creation  will  be  typed as they are now.  If sense switch 4 is not on,
       the system will begin auto-reload procedure.

            The system will not ask for the time and date to be  typed  in,  it
       will try to get them from the supervisor.  Failing this, it will request
       the first person to log in to give the time and date.

            The auto-restart sequence  will  consist  of  running  DSKCLN.   If
       DSKCLN  encounters  no  major  errors  (See  MM#5  on  DSKCLN  for error
       typeout).  Copycrash will be run.  This program will copy the crash file
       if one is present and output a message to this effect.  CHKPNT will also
       be started automatically.  (See MM#3 on CHKPNT).  When these things have
       been  done,  an  automatic schedule of 0, 400000, or 100000 will be done
       depending on conditions (See MM#2 on initialization and COPYCRASH)).

            When the system is initially loaded, if sense switch 4 is  on,  the
       system  will enter the "ONCE" dialogue.  The "ONCE" dialogue will prompt
       with "ONCE>" and wait for commands.

       ENTERING FILES DIALOGUE       ________ _____ ________

            The files dialogue is used to examine and change parameters of  the
       disk system.  There are two ways in which the files dialogue is entered.
       The first way is for the Operator to set sense switch  4  and  give  the
       command "FILES" when the prompt "ONCE>" is typed.

            The other method in which the files dialogue is  entered  is  as  a
       result of errors detected in the "HOME" blocks on the disk as the system
       is  brought  up.   The  "HOME"  blocks  store  information   about   the
       configuration of the disk system.

            There are "THREE" classes  of  errors  which  may  be  detected  on
       bringing up the system.  The "FIRST" class is extremely minor (I.  E., a
       unit off-line) and the system will just print a message telling  of  the
       condition.   The  "SECOND"  class  contains  those errors which may need
       fixing, but which the system can "LIVE WITH".  These are errors such  as
       the disk being off-line.  This class of errors results in the question:

       MINOR ERRORS - BRING SYSTEM UP ANYWAY?

            A POSITIVE answer will result  in  the  system  being  started.   A
       NEGATIVE answer will cause the message:

       ENTERING FILES DIALOGUE...
         TYPE "GO" TO RETURN TO ONCE.

            and the "FILES" will be started.
                                                                         Page 4
ONCE DESCRIPTION


            The "THIRD" class of errors are those  which  the  system  can  not
       accept  (I.  E., part of a File Structure missing).  This results in the
       message:

       ERRORS WHICH PREVENT BRINGING SYSTEM UP
       ENTERING FILES DIALOGUE...

         TYPE "GO" TO RETURN TO ONCE.

       LEAVING FILES DIALOGUE       _______ _____ ________

            The "GO" command at the "FILES*" prompt indicates that  the  "FILES
       dialogue"  is  to  be  terminated.   Entering "GO" at the "ONCE>" prompt
       indicates that the "ONCE" dialogue is to be terminated  and  the  system
       brought  up.   It  will  always  be the last command given to the "ONCE"
       dialogue.

            When the system is brought up with the "ONCE" dialogue and  a  unit
       has bad "BAT" blocks, the following will be asked:

       DO YOU WANT TO INITIALIZE THE BAT BLOCKS ON THIS UNIT?

            A POSITIVE ANSWER WILL RESULT IN

       NOT NORMALLY DONE, ARE YOU SURE?

            A positive answer to this question also will result  in  the  "BAT"
       blocks  being  rewritten  to indicate that there are no bad spots on the
       unit.

       ONCE DIALOGUE ERROR MESSAGES       ____ ________ _____ ________

            The following is a list of errors which may output:

       BP# IS OFF-LINE
       DO YOU WANT IT TO BE 1)ON-LINE, OR 2)DOWN?  (TYPE #)

            (The message may say BPA, BPB, or BPC.  This message indicates that
       the  controller is OFF-LINE (turned off, in local, etc.) If it should be
       OFF-LINE (for example, if the disk is sick  and  the  controller  turned
       off)  the Operator should type #2 (CR).  If the controller should not be
       OFF-LINE, turn it ON-LINE and type #1 (CR).  The controller will then be
       checked again to make sure it is really ON-LINE.
                                                                         Page 5
ONCE DESCRIPTION


            # = A, B, C, D, ETC

            %% = 0, 1, 2, ETC

       BP#(%%) IS OFF-LINE

            One of the units is OFF-LINE.  This may be  an  expected  condition
       and  the system will try to come up anyway.  (The unit might be a UNUSED
       drive which is turned off).

       BP#(%%) IS WRITE PROTECTED
       DO YOU WANT IT TO BE 1)WRITE-ENABLED, OR 2)WRITE-PROTECTED? (TYPE #)

            This is much like the controller OFF-LINE  message.   It  is  never
       normal for a unit to be ON-LINE and WRITE-PROTECTED.  

       BP#(%%) FIRST HOM BLOCK HARDWARE READ ERROR
       BP#(%%) SECOND HOM BLOCK HARDWARE READ ERROR
       BP#(%%) FIRST HOM BLOCK CONSISTENCY ERROR
       BP#(%%) SECOND HOM BLOCK CONSISTENCY ERROR

            These are all errors detected while trying to read the home blocks.
       Each  unit  has  two  copies of its home blocks.  Unless both blocks are
       bad, the good block will be  used.   In  this  case  simply  report  the
       problem  to  TYMCOM-10 Systems Support Service.  If both blocks are bad,
       the system will assume that the unit is not in a file  structure.   This
       may  also  lead to other error messages which will cause you to need the
       ONCE dialogue, but in itself is considered a minor error.  

       MORE THAN ONE LAST UNIT IN STR DSKB

       MORE THAN ONE UNIT WAS FOUND IN FILE STRUCTURE.  THIS ERROR  FORCES  THE
       ONCE DIALOGUE.  

       LAST UNIT WASN'T FOUND IN STR DSKB
       TWO LOGICAL UNIT 4'S FOUND IN STR DSKB
       LOGICAL UNIT #1 MISSING FROM STR DSKB

            All of the above errors force the ONCE dialogue.  They are  usually
       caused  by  having  the  wrong  set of disks on-line (such as the System
       Packs and a CE pack on-line at the same time).  

       ?NO STR'S IN "SYS" SEARCH LIST

            The "SYS" search list indicates which STR'S to use when  trying  to
       access  "SYS"  (I.   E.,  The R command or when logging in).  This error
       forces the ONCE dialogue.

       TWO LOGICAL STR 2'S FOUND IN "SYS" SEARCH LIST
       LOGICAL STR #1 MISSING FROM "SYS" SEARCH LIST

            These errors force the ONCE dialogue.
                                                                         Page 6

ONCE CHANGING PARAMETERS


       CHANGING PARAMETERS       ________ __________

            The "ONCE" dialogue is set up with a number  of  standard  options.
       In  general,  the  standard  options  should  be used at all times.  The
       information below should be sufficient for all but very special cases.

            When it is necessary for the "ONCE" dialogue to ask for a parameter
       to  be specified, it will print the current value, the minimum value the
       parameter may have, and the maximum value the parameter  may  have.   It
       will  then  wait  for the new value of the parameter to be typed in.  If
       (CR) is typed, the value of the parameter remains unchanged.  If certain
       parameters  are  changed  for  an  existing  structure or a unit in that
       structure, it may require that the structure be refreshed.  If  this  is
       true, a message will be printed:

       "CHANGE WILL CAUSE STR TO NEED REFRESHING"

            This is almost always a "BAD" change to make.  The best way out  is
       to  type (CR) when the parameter is requested.  Parameters should not be
       changed from the default values except in exceptional circumstances.

INCONSISTENT PACK SET ID


                           INCONSISTENT PACK SET ID                           ____________ ____ ___ __

            When a pack set is created with the REFRESHer, a number  is  chosen
       at random to be the PACK SET ID (not to be confused with the PACK SET ID
       written on slap-tages).  This number is written in  the  HOM  blocks  of
       every  pack  in  the  set.   Each time the system is booted up off those
       packs, the ONCDSK code check that every pack in the set has the same  ID
       number.   This  is  designed  to make sure that we notice if an operator
       gets some packs mixed up between sets.  When ONCDSK is checking that all
       packs  in the set have the same number, it increments the number on each
       pack.  So, if the monitor comes up successfully, each pack will have the
       same  new  random number (the <old random number>+1).  Since the packset
       ID is initially chosen randomly, different packsets will have  different
       ID  numbers,  and  any  mixing  of  packs between sets will be caught by
       ONCDSK code and the message INCONSISTENT PACK SET ID will come out.  The
       ONCDSK code is assuming that somebody has gotten packs mixed up.

            But, if the DISK hardware is at fault, ONCDSK may not  be  able  to
       set  the  incremented  PACK  SET ID number written back out to all packs
       while it is coming up;  this leads to the situation where several  packs
       in  a set will have an ID number X, and one or more packs have ID number
       X-1.

            When this occurs, you will see the message "MISSING OR INCONSISTENT
       PACK SET ID" for the unit or units causing the problem.

            You will be put in the FILES* dialogue of ONCE>.  Enter a TYPE  ALL
       and  when  completed,  enter  a Control X on the CTTY.  Check to be sure
       SENSE SWITCH #4 is SET.

            The next step is to check and make sure all DISKS are on-line.   To
       do  this,  FTALOD  the  PAKCP5.SAV tape and compare the disk status list
       with the disk drives.  If any are OFF-LINE that are not suppose  to  be,
       then  put it/them on line.  Do a RESTART and check them again.  If there
       still is a problem,  get  NOVADYNE  FE  involved.   Contact  your  Shift
       Supervisor and TYMCOM-10 Operations Coordinator.

            After all DISKS are on-line, load the  monitor  from  tape  with  P
       FTALOD(ESC).   After the monitor loads, you will be at the ONCE> prompt.
       At this prompt, type in DDT  with  a  carriage  return.   Next  type  in
       STRFIX/  (after  this  is  type  in  other  characters  will  print  out
       automatically).  After these print out, type in  JFCL  with  a  carriage
       return.   Next, type in 140(ESC)G.  DO NOT PRESS A CARRIAGE RETURN after
       this command.  After this command is entered  the  Current  Monitor  and
       date  will  output  and  you will be at the ONCE> prompt.  At this time,
       type in FULL with a carriage return.   If  all  went  well,  the  system
       should come up as usual with no errors being reported.

            If the system still comes up with errors, then contact  your  Shift
       Supervisor  and  TYMCOM-10  Operations  Coordinator.   If it is an error
       beyond our scope, then TYMCOM-10 Software Support will be notified.

            What this means is that the HOME BLOCK or BAT PAGES  has  sustained
       some damage.  It depends on what error message you receive if the system
       will come up.  If you only receive  "FIRST  HOME  PAGE"  or  "FIRST  BAT
       PAGE", or both, the system will come up okay.  The same holds true if it

PAKCOP


                       PACK COPY PROGRAM ON TYMCOM-10'S                       ____ ____ _______ __ ___________

                                 INTRODUCTION                                 ____________

            The PAKCOP program is  the  general  purpose  utility  package  for
       establishing,  copying and otherwise dealing with the disk packs used on
       the TYMCOM-X for file storage and swapping.  Through  this  program,  ID
       information,  HOM  and  BAT page parameters, and pack zformatting can be
       established.  One of the most commonly used capabilities is the  copying
       of  entire packs to other packs, either to provide off-line backup or to
       enable replacing error-prone disk packs with other packs.

            Since the effects of this program are so extensive, the interaction
       of  other  processes  on  the  TYMCOM-X  must  be eliminated:  PAKCOP is
       therefore a "STAND-ALONE" program - it can only be run after the  system
       has  been  taken  down;  it must be the only job running.  The important
       consequences of this program also require that the operator maintain the
       highest  level  of  caution  and attentiveness while running it from the
       console teletype.  The  RESTART  and  LIST  commands  (described  below)
       should  always  be  used  whenever  packs are moved.  During copies, the
       running packs should be write  protected.   All  pack  labels  and  tags
       should   be  kept  accurate.   In  general,  a  good  precaution  is  to
       DOUBLE-CHECK EVERYTHING whenever you are using PAKCOP!

                              COMMAND DESCRIPTION                              _______ ___________

            When the PAKCOP program is loaded, it will print its version number
       and  request  that the date and time be typed in.  PAKCOP will check and
       print the status of all units on the teletype.  PAKCOP  has  information
       assembled  into  it  about which units are on what SA-10, which channel,
       etc.

            Units are named by  their  device  addresses  because  of  possible
       differences  in configuration between systems.  The device address is in
       octal.  The low order digit corresponds to the  number  on  the  address
       plug.   If  an  SA-10,  SA-10  channel,  or 3674 kontroller is off-line,
       PAKCOP will report that along with a list of the units  it  expected  to
       find on that device.  Examples:  

       KONTROLLER OFF-LINE, UNITS 340-347

            If a unit is off-line  (turned  off,  no  address  plug  with  that
       number, etc.) the report will be:

       "300 OFF-LINE"

            If the unit is on line, the report will be

       "301 ON-LINE"  (and one or more of the following msgs.)

       DUAL DENSITY (unit is a model II with twice model I capacity)
       WRITE PROTECT (the read read/write switch is in read)
       UNFORMATTED  (pack format improper; needs reformatting.)
                                                                        Page 18
PAKCOP


            Next the program prompts with "PAKCOP>" for a command.  When typing
       to  PAKCOP,  rubout  and control U can be used just as at monitor level.
       Typeout may be suppressed with control O.  Commands may be abreviated to
       as  many  characters  as  make them unique.  Three characters are always
       enough.  When waiting for a command, PAKCOP  will  ring  the  bell  once
       every  two  seconds.   PAKCOP may be aborted at any time and returned to
       command level by typing the (esc) or (alt) key.

                               GENERAL COMMANDS                               _______ ________

       SHH

            This command causes PAKCOP to stop ringing the bell.  Its effect is
       canceled whenever a command is executed.

       HELP

            This command causes a list of commands with a short description  of
       each to be printed.  THERE ARE SOME COMMANDS IN THIS LIST THAT OPERATORS                            _____ ___ ____ ________ __ ____ ____ ____ _________
       ARE NOT TO USE WITHOUT FIRST CONTACTING "TYMCOM-10" SUPPORT PERSONNEL.       ___ ___ __ ___ _______ _____ __________ ___________ _______ __________

       STATUS

            This command prints out the  status  (unformatted,  write  protect,
       etc.) of each unit which is on-line.

       RESTART

            This command causes the program to retest the status of all  units.
       If  a unit is turned on or changed from read to read/write or read/write
       to read, this command must be used for PAKCOP to sense the new status of
       the unit.  It should be used whenever packs are moved.

       BOOTS

            This command causes PAKCOP to check the units on-line in an attempt
       to find a copy of the boot program.  If it finds one it loads it in core
       and starts it.  If one is not found a message is typed and a restart  is
       performed without needing the bootstrap tape.
                                                                        Page 19

                                 UNIT COMMANDS                                 ____ ________

            The following commands require a unit or  a  set  of  units  to  be
       specified.   A  single unit is specified by typing its number.  A set of
       units may be specified by typing a list of numbers as 300,301  or  "ALL"
       may  be  used.   If ALL is used, the command will affect all units which
       are on-line.  If the unit number of a drive which is off-line, or  if  a
       bad  string  (not  numbers, etc.) is typed the operator will be asked to
       retype the drive list.  Each of the following commands  is  followed  by
       either  (list) or (one unit) to indicate whether the command will accept
       a list of units or only one.

       LIST (list)

            This command lists information from the HOM and BAT  pages  on  the
       unit.   If the HOM and BAT pages are not correct or have hardware errors
       one or more of the following messages may appear:  

       FIRST HOM PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       SECOND HOM PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       FIRST HOM PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR
       SECOND HOM PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR
       FIRST BAT PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       SECOND BAT PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       FIRST BAT PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR
       SECOND BAT PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR

            The information printed from the HOM and BAT pages is:

       UNIT ID: 280203
       STRUCTURE: DSKB LOGICAL UNIT: DSKB0
       NO COPY DATE       OR      LAST COPY DATE 12-NOV-1973
       NUMBER OF BAD REGIONS: 1
       NUMBER OF BAD SECTORS: 1
       RECORD,HEAD,CYL 5,13,107
       1 RECORD(S)  12-NOV-1973     OR     NO DATE


                                         NOTE

           (If there are no errors indicated  in  the  BAT  pages  'NO  BAD
           SPOTS' will be printed.)

       The following command is a VERY DANGEROUS command to use.  If it is used                                  ____ _________
       at  any  time other than shown in this document, you will not be able to
       bring the system up.  If you inadvertently  use  it  when  you  are  not
       suppose to, STOP and call your Shift Supervisor, Operations Coordinator,                   ____
       or Operations Manager immediately.  Throughout this  document,  whenever
       this command is used, there is a WARNING message.                                        _______

       INIT (one unit) (See "WARNING" above)

            This command initializes the HOM and BAT pages on a unit.   If  the
       unit already has HOM pages, PAKCOP will ask 

       UNIT ALREADY HAS HOM PAGES, OVERWRITE? 

            An answer of YES is required (or Y or YE) in order to write new HOM
       and BAT pages.

            The command will then prompt

       'ID:'.  

            The ID to be specified is any  6  characters.   However,  the  copy
       command  expects  the  first  two character to be the system number, the
       second two characters to be  the  pack  set  number  and  the  last  two
       characters to be the pack number.

       NEW
       (one unit)

            This command changes the ID in the HOM page on the  selected  unit.
       The unit must already have valid HOM pages.  The prompt is

       'ID:'.

            The 3350 (single-density)  type  disks  have  the  ability  to  use
       alternate  tracks  to  take care of bad spots on a pack.  A track may be
       marked as defective with a pointer to its  alternate.   Every  time  the
       defective  track  is  referenced,  the alternate will be read or written
       instead.  This avoids problems with inconsistant BAT pages  on  a  copy.
       PAKCOP  can report and check the alternate tracks that have been set up.
       A fresh 3350 pack has 555 data cylinders, 5 alternate cylinders, and one
       (1) maintenance cylinder.

            The  3350  (dual-density)  type  disks  have  the  ability  to  use
       alternate  tracks  to  take care of bad spots on a pack.  A track may be
       marked as defective with a pointer to its  alternate.   Every  time  the
       defective  track  is  referenced,  the alternate will be read or written
       instead.  This avoids problems with inconsistant BAT pages  on  a  copy.
       PAKCOP  can report and check the alternate tracks that have been set up.
       A fresh 3652 pack  has  two  sets  of  555+5  cylinders,  and  a  single
       maintenance  cylinder.   With  30 heads, that means 150 alternate tracks
       per locial unit.

       VERIFY (list)

            This command checks the formatting of  the  entire  pack.   If  the
       formatting is correct, the message 

       'VERIFIED UNIT 367'

            will be printed.  If the format is not correct, an  error  will  be
       printed:
                                                                        Page 21
PAKCOP


       'UNIT 301 BAD ALTERNATE TRACK SETUP ON CYL 135 HEAD 15'

       or

       'INCORRECT FORMAT' 

            followed by 

       'UNIT 300 DOES NOT VERIFY'

            If the bad alternate track message is printed,  give  the  printout
       and  the  pack  to  your Shift Supervisor.  The VERIFY command calls the
       AVERIFY command.

       ZFORMAT (list)

            Zero out all alternate track assignments.  This command  wipes  out
       any  previous  bad  track  information  and  formats  the  entire  pack,
       including alternate cylinders.

            This command establishes the correct format on a pack.  The  format
       command  calls  the  AFORMAT  command.  It also calls the VERIFY command
       when it has finished to insure that the format has been  correctly  set.
       If PAKCOP believes that the pack is already formatted, it will ask:  

       'UNIT 300 ALREADY FORMATTED, REFORMAT?'

            An answer of YES will cause the pack to be reformatted.   If  there
       are no errors, the message

       'UNIT 301, ALTERNATE TRACKING ZEROED'

            will be printed.  Possible errors are:

       UNIT 301 DOES NOT VERIFY
       (the format was written with no error indication but won't verify)

       UNIT 301 BAD ALTERNATE TRACK SETUP ON CYL 135 HEAD 15
       (save the printout and notify the Shift Supervisor)

            Any hardware error will be followed by the message

       'FORMAT ABORTED'.

       COPY (list)

            The copy command has several options which are  selected  by  sense
       switches  1,  2 and 3.  The COPY command will always print out a list of
       the options as currently selected.  The normal  mode  of  operations  is
       with none of the switches on.

            SWITCH 1 [40] OFF

       alternate tracks will be assigned for pages
       indicated bad in BAT pages on the destination pack (sense switch 1)
                                                                        Page 22
PAKCOP


            SWITCH 1 [40] ON

       copy will abort if any bad regions are
       indicated in the BAT pages on the destination pack (sense switch 1)

            SWITCH 2 [20] OFF

       copy will abort on read errors from source pack
       for pages not marked bad (sense switch 2)

            SWITCH 2 [20] ON

       read errors from source pack will be reported but
       copy will continue (sense switch 2)

            SWITCH 3 [10] OFF

       alternate tracks will be assigned for pages
       with read or write errors on destination pack (sense switch 3)

            SWITCH 3 [10] ON

       copy will abort on read or write errors on
       destination pack (sense switch 3)

            After printing the options currently in force, PAKCOP
       prompts with:

       'SOURCE DRIVES:'

            A list of source drives may be specified. Since the program takes
       advantage of I/O overlap, copying more than one drive at a time
       is an advantage.

            After the list of source drives is typed, the following
       is repeated for each source drive.

       "COPY FROM 300 TO:"

            PAKCOP now wants the unit number of the destination drive
       for the specified source drive. After this number is
       supplied, any of a number of errors may result.

       SOURCE PACK NOT FORMATTED
       DESTINATION DRIVE IS NOT FORMATTED
       SOURCE DRIVE NOT WRITE PROTECTED
       DESTINATION DRIVE IS WRITE PROTECTED
       DESTINATION DRIVE IN USE BY A COPY 
       (the destination drive specified for more than one copy operation)
       DRIVES NOT OF THE SAME DENSITY 
       (one is dual density and the other is single density)

            Any of these messages will cause this copy (not all of them) to
       terminate. Whenever a copy terminates, a message will be printed

       "COPY FROM 300 TO 301 ABORTED".
                                                                        Page 23
PAKCOP


            PAKCOP will not read the HOM and BAT pages on both units.
       Any HOM or BAT page errors will abort the copy.  The HOM ID'S
       of both units will be checked as well as the copy dates. When a
       copy is completed, the copy date of the destination pack is set
       to the current date. Any one of a number of messages may
       now be printed

       DESTINATION COPY DATE LATER THAN SOURCE COPY DATE
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION SYSTEM NUMBERS DIFFER
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION UNIT NUMBERS DIFFER
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION SET NUMBERS ARE THE SAME

            Then the message 

       "COPY FROM (TIME/DATE/NODATE) 280203 TO 280103 (TIME/DATE/NODATE)

       OK?" 

            will be printed.  The units are specified by their HOM ID'S in this
       message.   If  the  answer is not YES, the copy will be aborted.  If the
       answer is YES, the copy will proceed as follows:

            The BAT pages of the destination unit  will  be  checked.   If  any
       pages  are indicated as bad, they will be checked by writing and reading
       some selected data patterns.  If any are really found  to  be  bad,  the
       copy  will  either abort or attempt to assign alternate tracks depending
       on the setting of sense switch 1.  If alternate tracks are  assigned,  a
       message will be printed as 

       'CYL,HEAD 407,3 ASSIGNED AS ALTERNATE FOR CYL,HEAD 125,8' 

            If no more alternates are available, the message 

       'NO MORE ALTERNATE TRACKS AVAILABLE' 

            will print and the copy will be aborted.

            After the BAT pages on the destination pack have been checked,  the
       copy  will  proceed  by reading data from the source unit, writing it on
       the destination unit, reading it back from  the  destination  unit,  and
       comparing  the  data.   If  no  errors are detected the HOM pages on the
       destination pack are then updated with the copy date and  the  structure
       information from the source pack.  The BAT pages of the destination pack
       are cleared.  A final message is printed:  

       "COPY COMPLETED FROM 301 TO 300"
                                                                        Page 24

           2.  Always keep drives with source (copy from packs)
               in READ only.

           3.  Always issue RESTART and LIST commands whenever
               drive/pack status changes (packs are moved).

           4.  Keep PAKCOP hardcopy output on CONSOLE TTY.

           5.  Always DOUBLE and TRIPLE check everything.

           6.  Under NO circumstances is the SOURCE pack
               ever to be left on a drive that is NOT
               WRITE PROTECTED.

           7.  The LIST command should be run before and after
               each COPY command to verify that the right packs are
               being used and that the copy was successful.

PAKCOP ERRORS


       ERRORS       ______

            In most cases unrecoverable errors will be reported.  The only case
       in  which  this  is  not true is if the program interprets the error for
       some other purpose.  For example, the copy command when  it  is  testing
       pages marked bad to see if they are really bad.

            There are five places where errors may happen:  Reading the  source
       pack;   Writing  the  destination  pack;   Reading the destination pack;
       Checking data after readback;  And writing the updated HOM pages.

            If any read or write errors occur, they are analized to see if they
       are  data errors or probable hardware errors (overrun, etc.) If they are
       hardware errors the error and a message 

       PROBABLE HARDWARE ERROR ON SOURCE PACK
       WRITE ERROR ON DESTINATION PACK
       (PROBABLE HARDWARE ERROR)
       READ ERROR ON DESTINATION PACK
       (PROBABLE HARDWARE ERROR)

            is printed and the copy is aborted.

            For a read error on the source pack which is a probable data  error
       the BAT pages on the source pack are checked.  If the error is in a page
       marked bad, the message

       "ERROR IS IN A PAGE MARKED BAD. CONTINUING"

            is printed and the copy continues.

            If the error is in a page not marked in the  BAT  pages,  the  copy
       will  abort  after  typing  the  error if sense switch 2 is not set.  If
       sense switch 2 is set, the error will be printed followed by

       "CONTINUING".

            For read or write errors on the destination pack, either  the  copy
       will  abort  after  printing the error (sense switch 3 set) or the error
       will be printed and an attempt made to assign an alternate  track.   The
       copy will abort only if an alternate track can not be assigned.

            Data compare errors always abort the copy with the message

       "DATA DOES NOT COMPARE BUT NO HARDWARE
       DETECTED ERRORS"

            Failure to write the updated HOM pages results in the message 

       "CAN NOT WRITE HOM PAGES ON DESTINATION
       PACK AFTER ALL PAGES COPIED".

            The destination pack may contain  incorrect  copy  date  and  other
       wrong data.
                                                                        Page 28
PAKCOP ERRORS


            After an error during a copy you  should  recopy  the  packs  again
       possibly using different disk drives.

            PAKCOP only prints  error  messages  for  non-recoverable  hardware
       errors.  If the unit goes off-line the message 

       "UNIT 363 HAS GONE OFF-LINE"

            will be printed.

            All other error mesages start with 

       "UNRECOVERABLE ERROR ON UNIT 361
       CYLINER 107,HEAD 2,RECORD 14"

            The messages which may print from the SA-10 are 

       SELECT ERROR
       BUS IN PARITY ERROR
       CONTROL ERROR
       LENGTH ERROR
       INTERUPT ERROR

            Error output from the status byte would be:

       ATTENTION
       BUSY
       UNIT EXCEPTION

            And from the decoded sense bytes the following:

       BUS OUT PARITY ERROR
       OVERRUN
       INVALID TRACK FORMAT
       NO RECORD FOUND
       PROTECTION FAILURE
       DATA CHECK
       COMMAND REJECT
       UNIT IS WRITE PROTECTED
       EQUIPMENT CHECK
       PERMANENT EQUIPMENT CHECK

            The following will be printed only if no sense can be made
       from the sense bytes returned:

       UNKNOWN ERROR BYTE 1 BIT 2
                                                                        Page 29

            After the System is down, and it is at the "BOOTS" prompt, load  in
       the  "PACKCOPY" version from disk.  The "PACKCOPY" program PAKCP5 should
       be called before taking the disk UNITS off-line.  If  not,  the  program
       will  have  to  be  loaded  via tape.  It may be helpful to list out the
       "HELP" commands after entering the date, time, and after the  status  of
       UNITS prints out.

                           CHECKING DISK UNIT STATUS                           ________ ____ ____ ______

       Before performing a "PACKCOPY", you need to put the unit to be copied to
       "ON-LINE"  and  in  "READ/WRITE" mode.  All other "UNITS" must be put in                                                                 ____
       "READ ONLY" mode.

                           PUTTING ONE UNIT ON-LINE                           _______ ___ ____ _______

       Go to the back of the module, and after opening the double doors, locate
       the  panel  that  has "CE MODE" and "SERVICE BYPASS" on it.  You will be
       working with the toggle switch under "CE MODE" only.  

       If UNIT is OFF-LINE, move "CE MODE" toggle switch  to  middle  and  then
       push "ATTENTION" button on UNIT to put it "ON-LINE".

                           PUTTING ONE UNIT OFF-LINE                           _______ ___ ____ ________

       To take UNIT "OFF-LINE", move "CE MODE" switch in direction of UNIT  you
       want "OFF-LINE".

                     PUTTING BOTH UNITS (MODULE) OFF-LINE                     _______ ____ _____ ________ ________

       Toggle "CE MODE" switch to "A" then "B", then return  to  middle.   Both
       UNITS are now "OFF-LINE".


                                         NOTE

                       * * * * * C A U T I O N * * * * *

           If the "CE MODE" switch is left in either position, "A" or  "B",
           that  UNIT cannot be brought "ON-LINE" until the switch is moved
           to the "MIDDLE".

                                         NOTE

           If you receive this error message after several tries, or if  it
           keeps  printing,  or if it stays here, check the UNITS to see if
           lights are flickering.  If they are not then  the  packcopy  has
           stopped.  Try it again.  If it happens again, then have NOVADYNE
           FE check out the UNIT.  If it turns out to be a HEAD crash,  the
           system  needs  to  be  rebuilt.  If NOVADYNE FE Hardware Support
           reports the UNIT/HDA is okay, then an attempt will  be  made  to
           use   the  ASP  SAVE  procedures.   Refer  to  ASP  SAVE/RESTORE
           procedures (PART IA).

           If it turns out to be a HEAD crash, then the system needs to  be
           rebuilt.    Inform   your  Supervisor,  Operations  Coordinator,
           Operations Manager,  Director  and  TYMCOM-10  Software  Support
           immediately.

           Turn hardware over to NOVADYNE to replace HDA and to  run  their
           diagnostics.

           Start procedures for REBUILDING using ASP tapes.

           If none of the above has occurred, proceed with next step.

             USING ASP SOFTWARE TO SAVE/RESTORE BOTH LOGICAL UNITS             _____ ___ ________ __ ____________ ____ _______ _____

            In this EXAMPLE, let's assume UNIT 300, BPA0, Disk Drive A,  DSKB0,
       Pack ID ##0000, has aborted on the COPY to UNIT 307, BPA7, Disk Drive H.
       It is not considered a HEAD CRASH.


                                         NOTE

           Both LOGICAL UNITS MUST be  SAVED  to  tape  and  RESTORED  even
           though ONE UNIT may have COPIED successfully.



            The packs on UNITS 307 and 347 should already been ZFORMATTED prior
       to  doing the COPY.  If they haven't, ZFORMAT them before getting out of
       PACKCOPY.  If they have been ZFORMATTED, put the UNITS  OFF-LINE.   Make
       sure  all  other  UNUSED  packs  are  not ON-LINE.  Put all SOURCE PACKS
       ON-LINE in READ/WRITE mode.  Do a RESTART to check if UNITS are  set  up
       correctly.   The  following is what the Disk Drives may look like before
       and after entering the RESTART command.

            NOVADYNE FE must now readdress:

               UNIT ID 307 to UNIT ID 300

               UNIT ID 347 to UNIT ID 340


            Next, they must readdress:

               UNIT ID 300 to UNIT ID 307

               UNIT ID 340 to UNIT ID 347

            After NOVADYNE FE completes the above, UNIT ID 307 and UNIT ID  347
       are  put  OFF-LINE  and  UNIT  ID 300 and UNIT ID 340 are put ON-LINE in
       READ/WRITE mode.

            This is what the disk drives may look like after NOVADYNE  FE  does
       the readdressing and before the RESTORE is started.

                      (3350'S MOUNTED ON 3652/3655/3656)                      _______ _______ __ _______________

       REBUILD AUTHORIZATION       _______ _____________

            Procedures for rebuilding a TYMCOM-X file system from ALL-FILES and
       BACKUP tapes.  The Center Manager, or his Designated Representative, and
       the TYMCOM-10 Systems Support Service should verify that  a  REBUILD  is
       necessary.

       PREPARATION       ___________

            The current version of the following tapes will  be  needed  during
       the REBUILD.

           A.  Tape with copy of SYSTEM.SAV or NEWMON.SAV for system being
       REBUILT.

           B.  Tape with copy of TITO.SAV.

           C.  Tape with copy of PAKCP5.SAV (PAGE Monitor) 

           D.  Most current set of ALL-FILES for system being REBUILT.

           E.  HARDCOPY directory of Tape #1 of ALL-FILES.

           F.  All BACKUP tapes taken after latest ALL-FILES.

       PROCEDURE       _________

            Enter  the  DOWNTIME  message  announcing  the  situation.   Use  a
       reasonable  estimate  of  how  long  the rebuild will take.  The message
       should be in the following form:

               "SYSTEM X IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. WE ESTIMATE ITS
                RETURN TO SERVICE AT "HHMM TIMEZONE" TIME ON "MM/DD"."

       To determine downtime, use the following as a guideline:

           a.  Four to five hours for NOVADYNE to check out
               hardware.

           b.  Twenty minutes for each UNIT that needs to be
               ZFORMATTED.

           c.  One and one-half hour for each ALLFILE tape to be
               restored.

           d.  Time it takes for DSKCLN to run.  Check
               DSKMAP that is in folder on mainframe.
               (30 minutes to one-hour)

           e.  One and one-half hour for each BACKUP tape that
               needs to be restored.
                                                                        Page 54
REBUILD 3652's WITH A/F TAPES




                                         NOTE

           As the rebuild progresses, the downtime estimate may need to  be
           revised.   If so, change it using two or three hour increments -
           this avoids the tendency to annoy users with shorter revisions.



            Put the UNIT that caused the problem OFF-LINE.  Put the UNUSED UNIT
       ON-LINE.   Refer to PAKCOP, PART I, for these procedures.  The UNIT that
       caused the problem will need to be written up and reported  to  NOVADYNE
       FE.

            After the unit/units are online, get into KLDCP, set  sense  switch
       #4 and FTALOD the PAKCP5.SAV tape.

       This  is  the  time to make changes before continuing.  If everything is

            If the system runs out of DISK SPACE, make an educated guess of how
       many  pages  you  will  need  to  complete the restore, then perform the
       following steps.

           A.  Delete all files under OPER

               DEL (OPER)*.*

           B.  Delete all files under HOLD

            Keep track of files deleted by repeating step C.  Mail needs to  be
       sent to BURNS1 listing the files that were deleted.

            After deleting the files continue the restore where  it  left  off.
       If  you  need additional space, then repeat steps A.  through D.  above.
       Remember to set the proper switches in TITO when resuming the restore of
       either the ALL-FILES or BACKUP tapes.

            After the System is down, and it is at the "BOOTS" prompt, load  in
       the  "PACKCOPY"  version  from  disk.  The "PACKCOPY" program PAKCP5.SAV
       should be called before taking the disk UNITS  off-line.   If  not,  the
       program  will have to be loaded via tape.  It may be helpful to list out

            Before performing a "PACKCOPY", you need to  put  the  unit  to  be
       copied to "ON-LINE" and in "READ/WRITE" mode.  All other "UNITS" must be                                                                        ____

            Go to the back of the module, and after opening the  double  doors,
       locate  the  panel  that  has "CE MODE" and "SERVICE BYPASS" on it.  You
       will be working with the toggle switch under "CE MODE" only.  

            If UNIT is OFF-LINE, move "CE MODE" toggle  switch  to  middle  and
       then push "ATTENTION" button on UNIT to put it "ON-LINE".

                           PUTTING ONE UNIT OFF-LINE                           _______ ___ ____ ________

            To take UNIT "OFF-LINE", move "CE MODE" switch in direction of UNIT
       you want "OFF-LINE".

                     PUTTING BOTH UNITS (MODULE) OFF-LINE                     _______ ____ _____ ________ ________

            Toggle "CE MODE" switch to "A" then "B",  then  return  to  middle.
       Both UNITS are now "OFF-LINE".


                                         NOTE

                       * * * * * C A U T I O N * * * * *

           If the "CE MODE" switch is left in either position, "A" or  "B",
           that  UNIT cannot be brought "ON-LINE" until the switch is moved
           to the "MIDDLE".

           If you receive this error message after several tries, or if  it

           FE check out the UNIT.  If it turns out to be a HEAD crash,  the
           system  needs  to  be  rebuilt.  If NOVADYNE FE Hardware Support

           reports the UNIT/HDA is okay, then an attempt will  be  made  to
           use   the  ASP  SAVE  procedures.   Refer  to  ASP  SAVE/RESTORE
           procedures (PART IIA).

           If it turns out to be a HEAD crash, then the system needs to  be
           rebuilt.    Inform   your  Supervisor,  Operations  Coordinator,
           Operations Manager,  Director  and  TYMCOM-10  Software  Support
           immediately.

           Turn hardware over to NOVADYNE to replace HDA and to  run  their
           diagnostics.

           Start procedures for REBUILDING using ASP tapes.

               USING ASP SOFTWARE TO SAVE/RESTORE A LOGICAL UNIT               _____ ___ ________ __ ____________ _ _______ ____

            In this EXAMPLE, let's assume UNIT 300, BPA0, Disk Drive A,  DSKB0,
       Pack ID ##0000, has aborted on the COPY to UNIT 307, BPA7, Disk Drive H.
       It is not considered a HEAD CRASH.

            The pack on UNIT  307  should  already  have  been  ZFORMATTED  and
       INITIALIZED  prior  to  doing the COPY.  If it hasn't, ZFORMAT it before
       getting out of PACKCOPY.  If  it  has  been  ZFORMATTED,  put  the  unit
       OFF-LINE.   Make  sure  all other UNUSED packs are not ON-LINE.  Put all
       SOURCE PACKS ON-LINE in READ/WRITE mode.  Do a RESTART to check if UNITS
       are  set  up  correctly.  The following is what the Disk Drives may look
       like before and after entering the RESTART command.

            At this time NOVADYNE FE has to get involved.   They  MUST  reverse

       prints out enter a carriage return to load the running monitor.

            At the first ONCE> prompt enter FULL.  FULL DSKCLN will now run  on
       the  system.   If it finds something wrong it may run TWICE.  DSKCLN may
       not  run  if  there  are  problems  with  (SYS)HOME.SYS,   (SYS)SAT.SYS,
       (SYS)SPAGES.SYS  or  (SYS)CRASH.SAV.  Any problems with DSKCLN should be
       reported to TYMCOM-10 Software Support.

            When the system comes  up  (SYS)RECOV.SYS  may  report  some  files
       losing  data.   These  files  should be restored as quickly as possible.
       Any (PPN).UFD[1,1]  files  should  be  reported  to  TYMCOM-10  Software
       Support for solution.

            After system comes up, complete  logbook  entries,  send  mail  and
       place the following ACCESS.MSG on System.  Update slap-tags.  Make up an
       INCIDENT REPORT and put a RED hat on the BAD unit.  Run 'RU (MPL)FNDBAD'
       as (SYS)RECOV.SYS does not always report all the bad files.

REBUILD 3650's WITH A/F TAPES


               REBUILDING THE FILE SYSTEM WITH "ALL-FILE" TAPES               __________ ___ ____ ______ ____ __________ _____

                      (3350'S MOUNTED ON 3650/3653/3654)                      _______ _______ __ _______________

       REBUILD AUTHORIZATION       _______ _____________

            Procedures for rebuilding a TYMCOM-X file system from ALL-FILES and
       BACKUP tapes.  The Center Manager, or his Designated Representative, and
       the TYMCOM-10 Systems Support Service should verify that  a  REBUILD  is
       necessary.

       PREPARATION       ___________

            The current version of the following tapes will  be  needed  during
       the REBUILD.

           A.  Tape with copy of SYSTEM.SAV or NEWMON.SAV for system being
       REBUILT.

           B.  Tape with copy of TITO.SAV.

           C.  Tape with copy of PAKCP5.SAV (PAGE Monitor)

           D.  Most current set of ALL-FILES for system being REBUILT.

           E.  HARDCOPY directory of Tape #1 of ALL-FILES.

           F.  All BACKUP tapes taken after latest ALL-FILES.

       PROCEDURE       _________

            Enter  the  DOWNTIME  message  announcing  the  situation.   Use  a
       reasonable  estimate  of  how  long  the rebuild will take.  The message
       should be in the following form:

               "SYSTEM X IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. WE ESTIMATE ITS
                RETURN TO SERVICE AT "HHMM TIMEZONE" TIME ON "MM/DD"."

            To determine downtime, use the following as a guideline:

           a.  Four to five hours for NOVADYNE to check out
               hardware.

           b.  Twenty minutes for eah UNIT that needs to be
               ZFORMATTED.

           c.  One and one-half hour for each ALLFILE tape to be
               restored.

           d.  Time it takes for DSKCLN to run.  Check
               DSKMAP that is in folder on mainframe.
               (30 minutes to one-hour)

           e.  One and one-half hour for each BACKUP tape that
               needs to be restored.
                                                                        Page 86
REBUILD 3650's WITH A/F TAPES




                                         NOTE

           As the rebuild progresses, the downtime estimate may need to  be
           revised.   If so, change it using two or three hour increments -
           this avoids the tendency to annoy users with shorter revisions.



            Put the UNIT that caused the problem OFF-LINE.  Put the UNUSED UNIT
       ON-LINE.  Refer to PAKCOP, PART II, for these procedures.  The UNIT that
       caused the problem will need to be written up and reported  to  NOVADYNE
       FE.

            After the unit/units are online, get into KLDCP, set  sense  switch
       #4 and FTALOD the PAKCP5.SAV tape.

       REBUILD AUTHORIZATION       _______ _____________

            The Center Manager,  or  his  Designated  Representative,  and  the
       TYMCOM-10  Systems  Support  Service  should  verify  that  a rebuild is
       necessary.  Don't take it upon yourself  to  rebuild  a  system  without
       proper authorization.

       PREPARATION       ___________

            Procedures for rebuilding a TYMCOM-X file structure from  ASP  dump
       tapes and BACKUP tapes.  

       TAPES NEEDED       _____ ______

                a.  Current copy of SYSTEM.SAV or NEWMON.SAV for system being
                    rebuilt.

                b.  Current copy of ASP.SAV.

                c.  Current copy of PAKCP5.SAV (PAGE Monitor).

                d.  Most current set of ASP Dump tapes for system
                    being rebuilt.

                e.  All BACKUP tapes taken after latest ASP dump.

       PROCEDURE       _________

            1.  After it has been determined that a REBUILD is necessary  issue
       the "TMS downtime message using the following format:

               "SYSTEM X IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. WE ESTIMATE ITS
                RETURN TO SERVICE AT 'HHMM TIMEZONE' TIME ON 'MM/DD'."


            Use a reasonable estimate of how long the rebuild will take.

            To determine downtime, use the following as a guideline:

           a.  Four to five hours for NOVADYNE to check out
               hardware.

           b.  Time it takes for tapes to be delivered  if not
               on-site.

           c.  Twenty minutes for each UNIT that needs to be
               ZFORMATTED.

           d.  Time it takes for DSKCLN to run.  Check DSKMAP
               that is in folder on mainframe.  (30 minutes to one-hour)

           e.  One to one-half hour for each BACKUP tape that
               needs to be restored.
                                                                        Page 94
REBUILD USING ASP DUMP TAPES




                                         NOTE

           As the rebuild progresses, the downtime estimate may need to  be
           revised.   If so, change it using two or three hour increments -
           this avoids the tendency to annoy users with shorter revisions.



            2.  It is  essential  that  the  pack  which  is  suspected  to  be
       clobbered not be used for the REBUILD.

               a.  If it is a 3350  disk  pack  running  on  3650/3653/3654  or
               running  on  3652/3655/3656, the unit(s) will be placed OFF-LINE
               and written up for checking by NOVADYNE  FE.   The  UNUSED  UNIT
               running on the string should be used.

            3.  Set sense switch #4 and FTALOD the  PAKCP5.SAV  tape.   ZFORMAT
       all  units that have five (05) or more BAD SECTORS/REGIONS that reported
       when doing a LIST in PAKCOP.  When completed, make sure  ALL  UNITS  are
       ON-LINE,  except  those that are to remain OFF-LINE.  FTALOD the current
       running SYSTEM.SAV or NEWMON.SAV monitor tape.

       ************************************************************************
       ************************************************************************

            If the system should CRASH during the ASP restore, return here  and
       FTALOD  the  current  running SYSTEM.SAV or NEWMON.SAV and continue with
       step 4 skipping the DISSOLVE and DEFINE parts only.

       ************************************************************************
       ************************************************************************

            4.  After the monitor  has  loaded,  enter  CONSOLE  at  the  ONCE>
       prompt.

            5.  At the next ONCE> prompt, enter FILES and a YES answer.   After
       entering  YES,  the  highest  memory  address  will  print  out  and the
       statement that you are entering the FILES dialogue.  All UNITS  will  be
       checked  and  if  any  are  missing you will receive a statement at this
       time.  Whenever an HDA is  replaced,  you  will  receive  the  statement
       LOGICAL  UNIT ## MISSING FROM STR DSKB.  This may print out twice and is
       OKAY.  Now at the FILES* prompt.

            6.  Enter DISSOLVE and a YES answer.

            7.  At the next FILES* prompt, enter DEFINE with a YES answer.   At
       this  point  enter  all the BP'S that are on line as reported when FILES
       was entered at the ONCE> prompt in step 5.  Enter two  carriage  returns

                            ADDING LOGICAL UNIT(S)                            ______ _______ _______

       NOTIFICATION       ____________

            Procedures for  adding  LOGICAL  UNIT(S)  to  the  file  structure.
       System Resources Allocation (SRA) will notify the Center Manager, or his
       Designated Representative, before UNIT(S) are added to a  system.   This
       notification  should be made within a reasonable amount of time to allow
       the Center to make preparations.

       RESTRICTIONS       ____________

            DSKCLN cannot run if DSKB is bigger than three million  (3,000,000)
       pages  in size, therefore, the maximum LOGICAL UNITS a system can handle
       is as follows:

           MEMOREX 3650 (300 MB/SPINDLE) = 25 logical units
           MEMOREX 3652 (600 MB/SPINDLE) 12.5 = drives = 25 logical units

       PREPARATION       ___________

            Before adding a LOGICAL UNIT  to  a  system,  certain  preparations
       should be performed first.

            A.  Are there enough PHYSICAL UNIT(S) on the System?  If  not,  are
       they  available  and  when  can they be added?  There MUST be one UNUSED
       PHYSICAL UNIT on each string at all times.

            B.  If adding to 3650's/3652's has the LOGICAL  UNIT(S)  been  DSF?
       If not, this must be done first.

            C.  Special-schedule the  system  down  and  inform  Users  of  the
       schedule by issuing the ACCESS.MSG and the BROADCAST.MESSAGE.

            D.  ACCOUNTING and BACKUP should be completed.

            E.  Make up slap-tags with the following information:

           LOGICAL UNIT:DSKB##/DSKB##          ;Both are used for 3652's
           STRUCTURE ID:BPA##/BPB##/BPC##      ;BPA/BPC are used for 3652's
           UNIT        :SYS##/SET##/PACK ID##  ;Both are used for 3652's
           UNIT ID     :300/347                ;Both are used for 3652's
           PHYSICAL ID :A1                     ;Needed on all systems
                                                                        Page 98

                                         NOTE

           Labels can be printed out from (FREMONTDOC:74)LABEL.52.



            F.  Use next ASP rotating set of tapes for ASP dump.

            G.  At the appropriate time, ususally TWO  hours  before  scheduled
       downtime, issue the PSCHED letter.  Issue the DOWNTIME message after the
       system is down.

            H.  Now is the time to check to make sure you have the correct  ASP
       tapes  for  the  system  and  that  ALL labels and straps are identified
       correctly and dated the date the ASP dump is taken.

                              TAKING SYSTEM DOWN                              ______ ______ ____

            After performing all of the above, the system  can  be  taken  down
       using these procedures:

           1.  Run TAKEIT with BOOTS-LOADED option.

           2.  After the system is down at BOOTS:, press
               carriage return to load the current running SYSTEM.SAV.


                                         NOTE

           If system is suppose to be up on NEWMON,  enter  NEWMON  at  the
           BOOTS:  prompt and then press carriage return.


           3.  After the monitor has loaded, the system is at ONCE> dialogue.

           4.  At the ONCE> prompt, enter CONSOLE and a carriage return.

           5.  At the next ONCE> prompt, enter READONLY (CR).

           6.  Login using CONSOLE login procedures.

           7.  SET STATUS and then change schedule to 600000.

           8.  At the TYMCOM-10 prompt (!), enter:

               '!'R ASP (CR)                                     

           9.  After the ASP Save has completed, and the tapes verified
           then type in:
                                                                        Page 99

               'BOOTS:'


            Enter PAKCP5 at the BOOTS:  prompt.  Type in  the  date  and  time.
       After  the  PHYSICAL UNIT status prints out, and it is verified, type in
       SH at the PAKCOP prompt.  Put the running set in READ  ONLY  mode.   Put
       the UNIT(S) to be added on-line and in READ/WRITE mode.

            Enter RESTART at the PACKOP prompt.  The BP'S that you  are  adding
       to the file structure should report as the only ones on-line, all others
       should report being OFF-LINE or ON-LINE, DUAL  DENSITY,  WRITE  PROTECT.
       ZFORMAT  and  INITIALIZE  the  UNITS to be added.  When initializing the
       UNIT(S) give them the same set number as the running set.  You should do
       a LIST and check the ID'S in case you made a mistake.

            IF YOU DID ENTER THE UNIT(S) ID INCORRECTLY, USE THE "NEW"  COMMAND            __ ___ ___ _____ ___ _______ __ ____________ ___ ___ _____  _______
       TO  CHANGE  IT.   DO  NOT  USE THE "INIT" COMMAND AND OVERWRITE THE HOME       __  ______  ___   __  ___  ___ ___ ______ _______ ___ _________ ___ ____
       BLOCK INFORMATION.         _____ ____________

            If  this  should  happen,  you  will   need   to   RE-ZFORMAT   and
       RE-INITIALIZE the UNIT(S) you are adding.

            Upon completion of the above put all UNITS on-line,  except  UNUSED
       units.   At  the  PAKCOP  prompt do a RESTART making sure UNITS that are
       suppose to be on-line are on-line.  Enter BOOTS and a carriage return at
       the  next  PAKCOP  prompt.   After  BOOTS LOADED and BOOTS:  prints out,
       enter a carriage return if coming up on current running monitor.   Enter
       NEWMON  at  the  BOOTS:   prompt  if  system has been running with a new
       monitor, or it is to come up with a new monitor.

REFRESH COMMAND IN ONCE


                                  APPENDIX II                                  ________ __

                            REFRESH COMMAND IN ONCE                            _______ _______ __ ____

            After typing  in  the  'DATE'  and  'TIME',  you  may  receive  the
       following error message:  

           'RESERVED PAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED'
           'The structure WAS NOT successfully refreshed.'

            There are two ways of getting  around  this.   This  is  the  first
       method:

           1) Get out of ONCE by entering control X (^X) on CTTY.

           2) FTALOD the PAKCP5.SAV tape.

           3) Do a LIST on all disk drives and ZFORMAT all units reporting  BAD
           REGIONS and BAD SECTORS.

           4) Upon completion, get  out  of  PACKCOPY  and  FTALOD  the  system
           monitor tapes.

           5) Bring up in CONSOLE mode and then continue  with  normal  REBUILD
           procedures.

       The second method is:

           1) After receiving the above error message, enter 'TYP BAT'  at  the
           FILES* prompt.

           2) After the statement 'Type unit name' prints out, enter the  first
           BPA#.

           3) If it reports '0 bad pages in 0', then it is okay.

           4) If it reports a number of bad pages then enter 'CHANGE BAT'  with
           a 'YES' answer at the next FILES* prompt.

           5) Repeat Steps 1 through 4 on all BPA'S, BPB'S, and BPC'S that  you
           are using for the REBUILD.

           6) After all UNITS have been checked, enter 'REFRESH'  at  the  next
           FILES* prompt.

           7) Continue the REBUILD using normal procedures.
