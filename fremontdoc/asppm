Corrective/Preventive Maintenance will be performed on the TYMCOM-10 Hosts as needed.
TYMCOM-10 Coordinator and Supervisors are
responsible for monitoring these systems and taking action as deemed necessary.
Users should be given a 24-hour notice.
.SKIP 1
When a host needs to be scheduled down for P/M, it must not interfere with
established policy, i. e. ticket system (primary and backup).
.SKIP 1
When a system is scheduled down for corrective/preventive maintenance (P/M), the
Operator taking the system down will page NOVADYNE on the COM line, requesting
that they come to the host.  The terminology to use is "NOVADYNE TO HOST _#_#".
.SKIP 1
Put all disk units in READ ONLY mode.
Before NOVADYNE performs diagnostics on 3650 disk drives, they will change the
switches on the 'Service Panel Controls' to further protect the system
units.
.SKIP 1
The system logbook will reflect the time and code when they took the system.

After NOVADYNE has completed what is required with the system, they will insure
everything has been configured correctly (except putting units back in
READ/WRITE mode) before turning the system back
to the Operator.  The Operator will put the units back into READ/WRITE mode.
They will inform the Operator of what was done.  This information
is to go into the system logbook and the mail.
.SKIP 1
The Operator will indicate in the system logbook the time they received the
system back from NOVADYNE.

Just bring the system up and let the monitor decide what is required.  In
all other cases, the type of DSKCLN to be run will be determined by what NOVADYNE
did during P/M.  No OPERATOR is to go into FILES dialogue and change
the DSKCLN once the monitor has chosen it.
.SKIP 1
FULL DSKCLN will be run if work was performed on DISK DRIVES or SA-10.
