          SECTION 1.0 PURPOSE          ___________________


          The purpose  of these  network specifications  is to  provide a
          detailed description of the customer's network from an external
          viewpoint.  This includes the operational and performance char-
          acteristics of the network.  These specifications are the basis
          for the acceptance criteria and the acceptance test procedure.

          A TYMNET network provides tools, technology, and flexibility to
          enhance, develop and implement a  customer's current and future
          network requirements.  These tools provide  the network manage-
          ment staff  with the information  necessary to  monitor network
          problems in real time,  and the ability to plan  for the expan-
          sion of the network.

          SECTION 2.0 NETWORK OVERVIEW          ____________________________




          SECTION 2.1 General Description          _______________________________


          A  TYMNET network  consists of  a  collection of  minicomputers
          (nodes) interconnected by communication lines to allow informa-
          tion to  travel along  alternative paths  between nodes  in the
          network.  The primary  function of a  node is to  pass informa-
          tion.   The nodes,  typically, do  little or  no processing  of
          application tasks.  Nodes  have buffers which are  used to hold
          data en route to another node or to a terminal or host port.

          TYMNET  technology provides  the flexibility  of designing  and
          building a network  in a nearly  infinite number  of configura-
          tions.  Customers may  choose to configure the  network to suit
          their  particular needs.   A TYMNET  network  consists of  four
          major types of components, examples of  which are shown in Fig-
          ure 1 and which are described below.

          In general, all  nodes are switchers and  contain basic routing
          and flow control.   They may  also contain  one of  these func-
          tions:  terminal interface, host interface,  gateway, or Super-
          visor.  However, in the case of  an ISIS node, several of these
          functions may run concurrently in one  network node.  (See Sec-
          tion 3.2.6 for more detail on ISIS.)

          Additionally, a fifth  network support function is  provided in
          the form of  the optional Network Control  Center (NCC).  Refer
          to Section 4.0 for more details on NCC components.

          The TYMNET  Engine is  used as  the processor  for the  network
          node.  Its configuration can be tailored  to match the applica-
          tion.

          2.1.1 Network Supervisor                __________________


          The network  Supervisor is the heart  of a TYMNET  network.  It
          performs the following functions within the network.

          A)   It controls user login.  This  includes verifying that the
               user is a valid network user,  limiting the user access to
               certain nodes or hosts, issuing  network messages at login
               time about the availability of nodes  or hosts, and build-
               ing a  circuit for each  session through the  network from
               the point of origination to the point of termination.

          B)   The Supervisor  collects accounting  information for  each
               circuit which is built in the network and stores it onto a
               disk file on the Supervisor machine.

          C)   The Supervisor  receives error  messages from  the various
               network nodes  and interfaces and stores  this information
               on a disk file.

          D)   The Supervisor monitors the state of all nodes in the net-
               work, and maintains a current image  of the network topol-
               ogy and resource utilization.

          E)   A process  called PROBE  exists on  each Supervisor  node.
               PROBE allows a network operator to  inquire about the con-
               dition of each node and host on the network, their associ-
               ated circuits,  if any, and  provides commands  to control
               access as required.   In addition, PROBE allows  a user to
               monitor the error log information in real time.


          2.1.2 Terminal Interface                __________________


          The TYMNET terminal interface is referred  to as a TYMSAT.  The
          Asynchronous TYMSAT provides  the interface to a  large variety
          of ASCII asynchronous  devices.  This module exists  both under
          ISIS and  as a stand-alone  node.  The Asynchronous  TYMSAT can
          also provide control  of a local line  printer device operating
          as a high speed  ASCII output terminal with  special host soft-
          ware  support.  The  Asynchronous TYMSAT  provides the  control
          which is specific to the  type of asynchronous device attached.
          It detects connect  and disconnect of the  device.  It performs
          serialization/deserialization of  the characters  going to  and
          coming from the device.  It also  echoes most of the characters
          it receives  from the  device.  In  some cases  of full  duplex
          operation,  the Asynchronous  TYMSAT  must  defer to  the  host
          interface to determine  how characters should be  echoed.  (See
          Section 3.2.3 for more detail on TYMSATs.)

          2.1.3 Host Interface                ______________


          The TYMNET host interfaces  include Asynchronous TYMCOMs, X.25,
          X.75,  3270, and  2780/3780.   The  typical customer's  network
          includes two types of host interfaces - Asynchronous TYMCOM and
          X.25.

          The Asynchronous  TYMCOM appears to  the host  as a set  of low
          speed  asynchronous modems.   This module  runs  on the  TYMNET
          Engine under ISIS.   (See Section 3.2.4 for more  detail on the
          host interfaces.)

          The TYMNET  X.25 interface serves as  a network interface  to a
          host, and provides access to a  host on a TYMNET public network
          or a customer  host in a private network.   It allows terminals
          on the network  to build circuits to the host  computer, and it
          also allows the host computer to  build circuits to other hosts
          on the network.

          The  TYMNET X.75  interface  allows  two public  data  networks
          (PDNs) to transmit data.  The  process involves the transfer of
          information between two signalling terminals, each within a PDN
          and connected by an international link.

          The 3270  interface provides  the  interface  between the  cus-
          tomer's IBM 3270  terminal and  support host  through the  cus-
          tomer's   TYMNET   network.   The   3270   interface   provides
          3270-terminal   access   to  computers   with   3270   support,
          3270-terminal access to computers with ASCII support, and ASCII
          CRT access to computers with  3270 support.  The interface also
          provides  multi-host/multi-application support  for 3270  users
          connected to a TYMNET network.

          The 2780/3780 interface provides  data communication for remote
          batch terminals (RBTs)  to host computers with  2780, 3780, and
          3770 series RJE terminal support through a TYMNET network.

          ISIS  nodes have special  host-like characteristics.  A circuit
          can  be built  to  the Kernel  of the  ISIS  node.  The  Kernel
          inspects the user name in the login stream and routes data from
          that circuit  to a  subprocess which  runs on  the node.   This
          function is described  in more detail in Section  3.2.6 of this

          2.1.4 Network Control Center                ______________________


          A TYMNET network may contain a set of functions that comprise a
          Network Control  Center (NCC).   This set  of functions  may be
          programs running on TYMNET Engines  within the private network.
          A  customer may  choose to  perform  network control  functions
          directly from dedicated  equipment (TYMNET Engines) or  to have
          Tymshare Operations  personnel perform  some of  the monitoring
          functions from the public network.

          The NCC programs are used to perform the following network-rel-
          ated functions.

          A)   The  accounting  programs collect  accounting  information
               from  the network  Supervisor nodes.   The programs  merge
               this data and reformat it into one record for each network
               session.

          B)   The validation  programs create or  modify records  in the
               Central User Directory  (CUD).  These records are  used to
               provide access for  new network users or  to modify access
               rights for existing network users.

          C)   The NCC also can be used to  monitor the network.  It pro-
               vides access to PROBE and the Error Logger information.


          2.1.5 Virtual Circuits in a TYMNET Network                ____________________________________


          All communications  in a TYMNET  network are done  over virtual
          circuits.  For  example, a port  on a TYMSAT  node communicates
          with a port on  a TYMCOM node via a circuit which  is set up by
          the Supervisor.  A  TYMSAT port or a TYMCOM port  may request a
          circuit from  the Supervisor.  If  the circuit requested  is an
          auxy circuit,  no password  is required.   Otherwise, when
          the request is made, the requestor  sends the Supervisor a user
          name, an optional  password, an optional destination  host num-
          ber, and a character indicating what  type of terminal or pseu-
          do-terminal is  making the  request.  The  Supervisor maintains
          tables  which  indicate  the current  network  topology.   This
          includes information for each node indicating what its neighbor
          nodes are,  what type and  what speed  lines connect it  to its
          neighbors, whether or  not any lines  are in  overloaded condi-
          tions, what hosts are connected to the node, etc.  The Supervi-
          sor uses this information to build  a circuit for the requestor
          through the network to the required destination.  Once the cir-
          cuit is built, data is sent through the network along this cir-
          cuit without further Supervisor intervention.

          2.1.6 Data Within a TYMNET Network                ____________________________


          The basic unit of  data is the character or byte  of 8 bits.  A
          circuit within  a TYMNET  network is  a fixed  path over  which
          bytes are transferred in both directions  in a first-in, first-
          out manner.   The content of the  data bytes is  transparent to
          the network and is the responsibility  of the interface at each
          end of  the circuit.  Because  the sequence is  maintained, the
          actual data  need not really  be in  8 bit quantities,  but may
          instead be  in quantities of anywhere  from 1 bit  to 1,000,000
          bits or more.   The only constraint is that  the total transfer
          (including  padding, if  necessary) be  a multiple  of 8  bits.
          (See Section 3.2.1 for more detail on packet construction.)


          2.1.7 Network Security                ________________


          There  are many  levels of  security within  a TYMNET  network.
          Each is discussed briefly below.

          A)   Network Logon

               In order to log in to a  TYMNET network, a user must enter
               a user name  which is  valid on the  network and  a corre-
               sponding password.   Only the user  name is echoed  to the
               terminal during logon  on a  full duplex  terminal.  Addi-
               tionally, the password is stored in the Master User Direc-
               tory (MUD) on the Supervisor's  disk in its encrypted form
               so someone having access  to the MUD would  find the pass-
               word illegible.

               In the standard (prompted) login mode, the password is not
               echoed to  full duplex  terminals and  is masked  for half
               duplex  terminals.   In the  optional  (unprompted)  login
               mode, the password is not masked on half duplex terminals.

          B)   Multiplexed Packets

               Packets sent  over links  between network  nodes typically
               contain data  for a  number of  circuits using  that link.
               Also, packets typically have only a  small number of char-
               acters for  a given virtual  circuit.  This  increases the
               difficulty of tracing data going  over any particular cir-
               cuit.

          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



          C)   Closed User Groups

               One of the characteristic  requirements of networks having
               large numbers of users is the ability to limit user access
               to only certain parts of the  network.  That is, it may be
               important to limit any given network user to access from a
               small set of entry nodes and to a small set of hosts.

               A TYMNET network  provides this capability in  the form of
               Closed User Groups.  In the MUD entry for every user is an
               access profile which indicates the set of nodes from which
               the user  may originate circuits and  the set of  hosts to
               which he may build circuits.

          D)   Gateway

               A gateway is a logical method  of interconnecting two dis-
               tinct networks.  Within a network,  the Gateway appears as
               a host.  Any and all security may be applied to its access
               as to any other host on the network.

               Logins received by the Gateway  from a foreign network are
               subject to all normal TYMSAT login restrictions.

          SECTION 2.2 Performance Criteria          ________________________________




          2.2.1 Network Delay                _____________


          The network  delay for a  circuit is  the algebraic sum  of the
          delays for each  process through which the data  must pass.  At
          the end  points, the amount of  delay depends on  the interface
          process.  For  the links along the  path, it is  almost totally
          dependent on  the line speed,  except for  anomalous situations
          involving line errors requiring  retransmissions.  Following is
          a table containing the average delay times for links of various
          speeds.  These numbers assume the line  is not completely satu-
          rated.  They  include both transmission  time for a  packet and
          holding time within a node until a  new packet can be transmit-
          ted.


                         LINK SPEED        AVERAGE ONE WAY DELAY
                          (KB/SEC)                 (MS.)
                         ----------        ---------------------
                            2.4                    220
                            4.8                    110
                            9.6                     55
                           56                       9


          2.2.2 Access Time                ___________


          Network access time  is defined as the time from  when the user
          types the  character terminating the  password entry  until the
          host  receives an  indication that  a  circuit to  it has  been
          built.  Assuming that no anomalies such as node outages or link
          outages occur  during the circuit  building process,  this time
          for a typical  Network (one of 100  nodes or less with  a login
          rate less than or equal to 60 per minute) is less than two sec-
          onds 90%  of the time,  and less than  four seconds 99%  of the
          time.

          The login  response time will  include both the  network access
          time and the time required for the  host to respond to the user
          login.  The apparent delay to the user may be much greater than
          the network access time.

          2.2.3 Network Availability                ____________________


          Network availability is  a function of network  node, line, and
          Supervisor availability.  Availability is  thus affected by the
          design of the network hardware,  the networking technology, the
          reliability of the communication lines, and the particular net-
          work configuration.  Tymshare is able  to control the first two
          of these areas.   We have designed many features  into both the
          network hardware and software  to assure a high  degree of net-
          work availability.  Also, by use  of the network simulator, the
          customer  can analyze  network  configurations  to provide  for
          optimum network resource availability.

          A)   The TYMNET Engine

               The TYMNET Engine has been designed by Tymshare for use in
               TYMNET as well as private networks.   To this end, we have
               used over ten years  of experience to design  and manufac-
               ture hardware  that is both unlikely  to fail and  easy to
               repair if it does fail.  For more information on the reli-
               ability and availability of the TYMNET Engine, see Section
               3.1.

          B)   Alternate Pathing

               A TYMNET network is designed to allocate an available path
               when a circuit is to be built in the network.  Normally, a
               TYMNET network  is configured so  every node has  at least
               two connections to  other nodes in the  network.  Thus, if
               one  link fails,  circuits can  be built  across the  link
               which is still available.

               In TYMNET  I, if a link  or intermediate node goes  out of
               service, all the  active circuits using that  link will be
               broken and  the user will be  forced to log in  again.  In
               TYMNET II, when such an  event occurs, the Supervisor will
               automatically build a new circuit  if a path is available.
               Other than a  hesitation due to the  circuit building, the
               user will be unaware of the occurence of the link outage.

               When a link fails, the network can take up to 8 seconds to
               determine that the failure has  occurred.  The delay expe-
               rienced by  the user  will include this  8 seconds  plus 2
               seconds for each  50 circuits which were  using the failed
               link.

          C)   Supervisor Backup

               As is explained in Section 3.2.2, a Supervisor outage in a
               TYMNET network is not a catastrophe since currently active
               circuits are  unaffected, and multiple Supervisors  may be



                                          Performance Criteria    Page 10



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               provided.  In the case of a Supervisor failure in a TYMNET
               network,  a backup  Supervisor  wakes  up within  a  short
               period of time and takes over the network.  The supervisor
               can complete takeover  of 1 to 20 nodes in  30 seconds, 21
               to 100 nodes  in one minute, and  101 to 200 nodes  in two
               minutes.


          2.2.4 CPU Loading Considerations                __________________________


          The following CPU load characteristics must  be taken into con-
          sideration when configuring  or expanding a network  node.  The
          necessary calculations have  been automated in the  PRICER pro-
          gram.  This  program may  be used  by TYMNET  to verify  that a
          given node configuration is supportable.

          A)   Constant System Overhead

               The ISIS operating environment and several of the hardware
               devices create a constant system overhead on the CPU.  The
               ISIS system  imposes an overhead of  up to 25% of  the CPU
               depending on the particular configuration.  The ISIS over-
               head will vary according  to the number of  job slots con-
               figured, the types of interfaces running in each job slot,
               and the aggregate data throughput.

          B)   Protocol Handlers

               Network Links -

               The CPU load  imposed by network link  handling depends on
               the number of channels per  link (set at system generation
               time) and  on the  amount of  user data  passing over  the
               link.  Up  to 3.0% of the  CPU is required to  support 160
               channels.  Up to 2.5% of the  CPU is required to pass 1000
               cps  of user  data through  a node  (in one  link and  out
               another).

               Asynchronous TYMSAT -

               CPU utilization by the Asynchronous TYMSAT code depends on
               the number of ports and  the average input/output rates of
               these ports.   For an average of  one cps in and  four cps
               out on 256 ports, 30% of the CPU is needed.  The relation-
               ships tend to be linear so that  256 ports running at dou-
               ble the above  I/O rates use about 60% of  the CPU.  Input
               and output create approximately the same  load on the net-
               work.  Thus, I/O  rates of 4 cps  in and 1 cps  out create
               loads equivalent to 1 cps in and 4 cps out.





                                          Performance Criteria    Page 11



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               Non-TYMNET Synchronous Protocols -

               For  X.25, the  CPU utilization  per line  depends on  the
               amount of  user traffic transmitted  over the  line.  This
               figure is about 1.5% per 100 cps of user data.

               Supervisor -

               CPU utilization by  the network Supervisor is  nearly com-
               pletely  dependent on  the login  rate and  the number  of
               nodes in the network.  CPU  utilization for the Supervisor
               increases with  the login rates and  with the size  of the
               network.  The impact of network size  is a function of how
               long the average  virtual circuit becomes.  For  a 20 node
               network and a login rate of one per second, the Supervisor
               requires 5%  of the  CPU.  For  a 20  node network  with a
               login rate of 3 per second, the supervisor requires 15% of
               the CPU.  For networks of up to  100 nodes, the CPU utili-
               zation will not increase significantly  if sufficient net-
               work links are added to minimize  the number of intermedi-
               ate nodes for most user circuits.

          C)   Constant Communication Device Overhead.

               In addition to the constant system  overhead and the over-
               head  of the  protocol handlers,  a  constant overhead  is
               incurred  to  service  the  hardware  interrupts  for  the
               asynchronous  and  synchronous   communications  interface
               hardware.  This overhead  depends on the number  of lines,
               and the transmission speeds of the lines.

               The following loads are  imposed for communications device
               overhead, not  including any  additional overhead  for the
               protocol handler which services the device:

            Device            # of Lines       Line Speed       CPU Load
            ------            ----------       ----------       --------

            Sync Board (1)          1          9600 bps           3.0%
            Sync Board (1)          1          4800 bps           1.5%
            Async Board (8)       256          110 - 1200 bps    25.0%
            Async Board (4)       128          110 - 1200 bps    12.5%
            SIO Board (1)          16          110 - 56 Kbps     cycle

          SECTION 2.3 Network Monitoring and Control          __________________________________________


          The active network  Supervisor is aware of the  status of every
          node, communication link, computer, any equipment in operation,
          errors occurring on  the communication  lines, and  load condi-
          tions of each  node in the network.   Additionally, the network
          Supervisor maintains a  complete chronological log of  all sig-
          nificant events in the  network.  This log is in the  form of a
          disk file which is maintained on the Supervisor node and can be
          read by building a circuit to the Supervisor node.  Examples of
          conditions reported are:

               o  any host computer down
               o  any node failure - such as power failure
               o  communication lines inoperative (unable to
                  pass data correctly)
               o  communication lines out of channels (capacity)
               o  communication line error rates (number of
                  retransmissions)


          2.3.1 PROBE                _____


          The Supervisor also permits manual  intervention and inquiry as
          to the status of any point  in a TYMNET network.  This function
          is referred to  as PROBE.  Examples of  PROBE functions include
          the ability to:

               o  examine network topology
               o  monitor login rate
               o  examine host conditions
               o  determine how many users are connected to a host
               o  determine where host users have originated a call
                  and which nodes they pass through en route
               o  stop new use of poor quality communication lines and
                  route new circuits over alternate paths


          2.3.2 Accounting Information                ______________________


          For monitoring purposes, a TYMNET network has available a chro-
          nological listing of each login that  shows the node from which
          the user  called, type of terminal,  user ID, port on  the host
          machine, time  on and off,  characters transmitted in  and out,
          and seconds connected.  A sort of this information gives valua-
          ble statistics about effectiveness of  the user's data communi-
          cations.

          2.3.3 Network Monitoring                __________________


          The network  constantly performs  checks on  its resources  and
          monitors performance.  If any anomolies occur, they are immedi-
          ately reported  to PROBE where  simple language  messages alert
          personnel to the  situation.  Network operations can  then per-
          form inspection and  analysis of the situation  remotely and/or
          dispatch maintenance personnel as  appropriate.  The conditions
          reported include:  line  errors on links, temperature  of proc-
          essor in each node, interface ports running open, cross-talk on
          long-lines, loss of or illegal interrupts, and many others.

          A complete summary of network  monitoring messages is contained
          in the PROBE User's Guide.                 __________________


          2.3.4 Network Simulation                __________________


          TYMNET  provides a  network  simulation  program called  SIMNET
          which can be used to simulate network activity for various net-
          work  configurations.  Expected  network  traffic patterns  are
          passed to the simulator in the form  of a session file contain-
          ing records similar to those in the accounting information men-
          tioned above.  A  network topology is specified  as input files
          to the simulator.  Using this tool, it is possible to plan net-
          work expansion intelligently and  with a high degree  of confi-
          dence.

          SECTION 3.0 NETWORK COMPONENTS          ______________________________


          The customer's network components consist of TYMNET Engines and
          the software  modules running on  them.  These  components have
          been mentioned in previous sections but are described here sep-
          arately in more detail.


          SECTION 3.1 Hardware Components - The TYMNET Engine          ___________________________________________________


          The TYMNET Engine  is the  standard computer  used in  the cus-
          tomer's network.   It is a  high performance  micro-code driven
          processor with sixteen sets of sixteen registers.  The internal
          cycle time is 125 nanoseconds.  Each  register is 32 bits wide.
          The processor has 3 I/O interrupt levels plus system interrupts
          and can contain up to a megabyte of memory.

          The TYMNET Engine is designed for  high reliability and ease of
          maintenance.  Its  modular design allows  expedient replacement
          of  the sub-assembly  components, resulting  in minimum  repair
          time should a failure occur.   When proper configuration guide-
          lines are  followed, the  TYMNET Engine  will provide  the user
          with at least 98% system  availability, excluding exterior com-
          munication components and environmental conditioning.

          Operational diagnostics are fully  integrated with the software
          components which run in the TYMNET  Engine.  This allows detec-
          tion of problems  and provides data for easy  analysis prior to
          serious impact on user throughput or availability.

          A site documentation  package including  Engine schematic  dia-
          grams is provided at each installation site.

          Following are  descriptions of  the various  components of  the
          TYMNET  Engine.   Configuration  limitations  are  noted  where
          applicable.


          3.1.1 Basic Package                _____________


          Following is  a list of all  the basic packaging,  cooling, and
          monitoring equipment needed with a TYMNET Engine.

             Cabinet, Blower, 16 Slot Chassis
             Power Supply
             EIA Monitor Panel
             System console
             Internal Cable Set
             Connector panel



                       Hardware Components - The TYMNET Engine    Page 15



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



          The power supply  is adequate for  a maximum  system configura-
          tion.  It can  provide up to 120  amps at +5 volts,  45 amps at
          +16.5 volts, and 45 amps at - 16.5 volts.

          The chassis provided contains 16 slots, the first four of which
          are used  for the  CPU board, the  ROM and  I/O board,  the MAC
          board, and the multifunction board.  The  other 12 slots may be
          used for memory or I/O boards which do not need to interface to
          the  DMA bus.   If  more  than 16  boards  are  needed for  any
          configuration,  or if  DMA  is required,  an  optional 16  slot
          expansion chassis must be installed.

          The Engine contains  two major busses: the I/O bus  and the DMA
          bus.  Their  throughput rates  are described  in the  following
          table:

                I/O Bus      Minimum     250K     Bytes/Sec
                             Typical     550K     Bytes/Sec

                DMA Bus      Typical     1.2 Meg  Bytes/Sec
                             Max         1.33 Meg Bytes/Sec


          3.1.2 Basic System Boards                ___________________


          Following  is a  list of  all the  boards, other  than the  I/O
          boards, which are needed to configure a TYMNET Engine.

             CPU Board
             ROM and I/O Board
             Memory Access Controller Board
             Multifunction Board
             64 Kb Memory Board(s)

          The  number of  memory boards  needed depends  on the  software
          which the  system must run.   The maximum  memory configuration
          currently possible on an Engine is 1024Kb (16 boards).

          The multifunction board contains the following:

             Teletype Interface (speed selectable 75-9600 baud)
             A.C. Line Voltage Sensor
             Watchdog Timer
             Temperature Sensor
             PROM Loader
             WWVB Interface (not the receiver)
             Power Fail/Restart Detection
             Interrupts for Real Time Reference

          3.1.3 Memory Access Controller Board                ______________________________


          The Memory Access Controller board (MAC) provides protection of
          memory by controlling access to it.

          The MAC partitions  physical memory address space  into logical
          address space.  At  system generation, each process  running in
          the node is  assigned its  own logical  address space.   There-
          after, the  process has access to,  and awareness of,  only its
          own  logical address  space.  The  same is  true of  peripheral
          devices attached to  the node.  Since the MAC  has control over
          the mapping of logical addresses  to physical memory locations,
          the process (or  device) is prevented, in  case of malfunction,
          from obtaining access  to, or writing over,  any memory address
          space not allocated to it.

          Two independent processes  might have the same  logical address
          for different real memory  locations.  Similarly, two processes
          might have  different logical addresses  for the  same physical
          memory area, to permit shared memory access.

          The MAC's handling of address  space enables selectable control
          of execute  inhibit access,  read only  access, and  read/write
          access.   Thus, the  MAC is  capable  of two  types of  address
          instruction checking.  Each addressing  instruction is screened
          to determine that it falls within  the range of logical address
          space allocated to the process  (or device) making the request.
          In addition, each such instruction  is checked for access type.
          The type of  access must correspond to the  access permitted to
          the process within the allowed logical address space.


          3.1.4 Synchronous Interface Board                ___________________________


          The synchronous  interface board provides  control of up  to 16
          synchronous lines.   Half of these  lines can contain  the data
          set control signals: Data Term Ready, Data Set Ready, and Clear
          to Send.  The other half  cannot.  Receive Data, Transmit Data,
          Receive Clock, Transmit Clock and Request to Send are supported
          on all lines.

          The maximum  speed of  any of these  synchronous lines  is 9600
          bits per  second.  The  board is capable  of supporting  all 16
          lines at 9600 bits per second.

          The interface signals provided conform to the EIA RS232C inter-
          face standards,  and are compatible  with CCITT  V.24 interface
          standards.





                       Hardware Components - The TYMNET Engine    Page 17



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



          If internal clocking is necessary, 4800 and 9600 bps clocks are
          available on all lines.

          The synchronous board interfaces to a  connector panel via rib-
          bon cables.   Cables which connect  to the terminals  or modems
          being controlled are connected via this connector panel.

          The synchronous board interfaces to the  I/O bus.  A maximum of
          two boards can be  installed in an Engine for a  capacity of 32
          synchronous lines in an Engine.


          3.1.5 Asynchronous Interface Board                ____________________________


          The asynchronous interface board provides  control for up to 32
          asynchronous communications  lines which  can be  in duplex  or
          half-duplex operation.

          Clocking for  all lines must  be done internally.   The maximum
          speed for any line is 1200 baud.

          In accordance with RS-232C signal protocol, control of six sig-
          nals is  provided for each line.   The signals provided  in the
          standard cables are  Carrier Detect, Data Term  Ready, Data Set
          Ready, Req to Send, Recv Data, and Xmit Data.

          The asynchronous board connects to the connector panel via rib-
          bon cables.

          The asynchronous board interfaces to the I/O bus.  A maximum of
          8 boards can be installed into an  Engine for a capacity of 256
          asynchronous lines.


          3.1.6 Connector Panel                _______________


          The cables  carrying the data set  signals to the  terminals or
          modems do not connect directly to  the synchronous or asynchro-
          nous boards, but connect to a panel called the connector panel.
          Signals from the synchronous  and asynchronous interface boards
          reach the connector panel via ribbon cables.

          A connector panel provides  connections for up to  13 asynchro-
          nous cables (64 ports or 2  asynchronous cards) and four synch-
          ronous cables (16 ports or 1 synchronous card).

          The connector panel also has facilities to allow one to monitor
          any signal on any line (going through that panel) via the moni-
          tor panel.

          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



          Connector panels are  mounted on the back of  the TYMNET Engine
          cabinet.  Up to four connector panels may be mounted on a given
          TYMNET Engine.


          3.1.7 Synchronous/Asynchronous Cables                _______________________________


          Four basic kinds of  cables are provided for  connecting termi-
          nals and modems  to the TYMNET Engine  connector panels.  These
          cables are  designed with one  connector which attaches  to the
          Engine and  one or more connectors  on the opposite end  of the
          cable for terminal  connections.  This enables one  cable to be
          connected to several devices.  The four kinds of cables are:

             Asynchronous Cable (5 ports)
             Synchronous Cable (4 ports)

             Asynchronous Crossover Cable ASC140-12 (1 Port)
             Synchronous Crossover Cable ASC140-13 (1 Port)

          The synchronous  cable can  connect up to  four devices  to the
          connector panel.  The first two devices receive signals on five
          leads (normally Recv  Data, Xmit Data, Recv Clk,  Xmit Clk, and
          Req to Send).  The second two devices receive the above signals
          plus three more  (normally Clear to Send, Data  Term Ready, and
          Data Set Ready).

          The asynchronous  cable can connect up  to five devices  to the
          connector panel.   Each device  receives signals  on six  leads
          (normally Carrier Detect, Data Term  Ready, Data Set Ready, Req
          to Send, Recv Data, and Xmit Data).

          Both the synchronous  and asynchronous cables may  be purchased
          in lengths of 25 or 50 feet.

          The  ASC140-12  interconnects the  following  signals:   RD-TD,
          TD-RD, SG-SG, DTR-DSR + CTS + DCD, DSR + CTS + DCD - DTR.

          The  ASC140-13  interconnects the  following  signals:   RD-TD,
          TD-RD, SG-SG, RC-TC, TC-RC.

          The standard length of the  synchronous and asynchronous cross-
          over cables is one foot.

          Other cables  may be used  for special applications.   Refer to
          the Cable Ordering/Installation Guide and  Catalog for descrip-              ______________________________________________
          tions of these cables.

          3.1.8 Printer Interface Board                _______________________


          The printer interface board can interface  with up to four par-
          allel printer  mechanisms running on  CDC protocol and  all are
          optically isolated.  The interface consists of:

             Printer Interface Controller
             Cables
             Data Printer - 600 LPM, 64 character chain
             Data Printer - 430 LPM, 96 character chain

          The printer interface board does not use the DMA bus.


          3.1.9 Expansion Chassis                _________________


          An expansion chassis is needed if more than 16 slots are needed
          to configure a  given system and/or if any devices  in a system
          need the use of the DMA  bus.  The expansion chassis is divided
          into two sets of  eight slots each.  A set of  eight slots must
          contain either all DMA devices or all non-DMA devices.

          As an example,  if a system needs 17 slots  for non-DMA devices
          and 3 slots for  DMA-type devices, it will need a  total of two
          chassis.  One chassis will house 16 of the non-DMA boards.  The
          first group of 8 slots in  the expansion chassis will house the
          other non-DMA board.   The 3 DMA boards would be  housed in the
          second group of 8 slots in the expansion chassis.


          3.1.10 Extended Selector Channel (ESELCH)                 __________________________________


          The ESELCH provides  control of up to 8  DMA-type devices.  The
          ESELCH is  normally used with disk  and tape units.   An ESELCH
          can control up to 8 devices --  only one of which may be active
          at any given  time.  The ESELCH must be housed  in an expansion
          chassis for DMA-type boards.


          3.1.11 Disk Support                 ____________


          Support for  up to 4  disk drives can  be provided on  a TYMNET
          Engine.  This support consists of the following:

             Disk Controller
             Disk Drive (10 Megabyte - 2 platters) Ampex DM448
             Cables

          The  disk  controller  connects  to the  DMA  channel  via  the
          Extended  Selector Channel.   This  implies  that an  expansion
          chassis for DMA-type devices must be included in the system.

          A maximum of one disk controller  can be configured in a TYMNET
          Engine.  It can control up to four disk drives.  One disk drive
          may be mounted  with the basic Engine.   Additional drives must
          be mounted in  expansion cabinets.  The expansion  cabinet con-
          tains room for up to four disk drives.


          3.1.12 Tape Support                 ____________


          Support for  up to 4  tape drives can  be provided on  a TYMNET
          Engine.  The  Engine will support  the following kinds  of tape
          drives:

             45 IPS 9 track, 800/1600 BPI Kennedy 9000
             75 IPS 9 track, 800/1600 BPI Kennedy 9100

          The tape  controller must  connect to the  DMA channel  via the
          ESELCH.  This  implies that an  expansion chassis  for DMA-type
          devices must be included in the system.

          A maximum of one tape controller  can be configured in a TYMNET
          Engine.  This can control up to  four tape drives.  Tape drives
          must be  mounted in  expansion cabinets with  a maximum  of two
          tape drives per cabinet.


          3.1.13 Serial Input-Output Board (SIO)                 _______________________________


          A  board is  available  which provides  control  of high  speed
          synchronous and asynchronous lines.   This control requires the
          following hardware:

             SIO board
             Line interface chassis
             Line Interface Boards (V.24, V.35, optically coupled)
             Cables

          The SIO controller  board attaches to the DMA  channel and thus
          requires a DMA expansion chassis in the system.

          The SIO  controller board can control  up to 16  synchronous or
          asynchronous lines at a maximum aggregate speed of 480,000 bps.

          In synchronous mode,  the controller board supports  either the
          bit stuffing  (SDLC/HDLC) protocol  or byte  synchronous (e.g.,
          BSC) protocols.

          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



          Up to four SIO controller boards may be included in any system.
          It should be noted, however, that the total throughput capabil-
          ities  of  the  hardware/software must  be  considered  in  any
          configuration.

          The SIO  controller board  uses small  interface boards  in its
          connector panel.  Each of these line adapter boards handles two
          lines.  The  line interface boards perform   protocol interface
          (e.g., bit stuffing) and also convert  the TTL level signals to
          the appropriate  standards.  These line  adapter boards  may be
          randomly mixed for any given SIO controller board.

          There are, currently, four line interface boards:

               1) V.24  Asynchronous  -  handles   two  lines  using  the
                  V.24/RS232  standard interface  at  speeds  up to  9600
                  baud.

               2) Optically coupled  - for hardwired  connections between
                  machines within  a few  hundred feet  of each  other at
                  speeds up to 162,500 bps.

               3) V.24  Synchronous   -  handles  two  lines   using  the
                  V.24/RS232 standard  interface at  speeds up  to 20,000
                  bps.

               4) V.35 Synchronous  - handles  two lines  using the  V.35
                  standard interface at speeds up to 160,000 bps.

          Two input control leads and two output control leads are avail-
          able on each port.  The default  signals provided are Data Ter-
          minal  Ready, Request  to  Send, Data  Set  Ready, and  Carrier
          Detect.  Coding of these signals is inverse.

          SECTION 3.2 Network Software          ____________________________


          As  was mentioned  earlier, TYMNET  software  consists of  five
          basic functions.  These are the  Node Code, the Supervisor, the
          TYMCOM, the  TYMSAT, and  the Gateway.   A network  node always
          contains the Node  Code function.  In stand-alone  systems, the
          node also  contains one  of the  other functions.   In an  ISIS
          node, the node will contain the Node Code functions plus one or
          more  of the  other functions.   These functions  and ISIS  are
          described below.


          3.2.1 Node Code                _________


          Each network  node contains  routines to  perform the  function
          known as  the Node Code.  The  node code handles  the internode
          protocol, the tearing  down and building of  packets, modifica-
          tion of the permuter tables upon the command of the Supervisor,
          and the flow control of data across network links.


          A)   Internode Protocol

               Tymshare has developed its own  internal node-to-node pro-
               tocol for  intra-net data  transfers.  The  protocol is  a
               full duplex, error checking, ACK-with-data design which is
               much like X.25  level 2 only  highly tuned and  more effi-
               cient.  The protocol is described  in detail in supporting
               documentation.

               Data travels in the form of packets between network nodes.
               Each packet  may contain data  for several of  the network
               circuits using the link.  Each  packet is checksummed with
               a 32 bit checksum.  When a  packet is received with a good



                                              Network Software    Page 23



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               checksum, a  corresponding acknowledgement  is sent  along
               with data  in the  next packet  transmitted back  over the
               link.  This TYMNET technology tends to reduce the overhead
               of data packets by multiplexing data traveling in the same
               direction into single packets.

               The TYMNET  I packet format  is indicated  below.  Several
               different TYMNET II  packet formats also exist.   A packet
               can consist of several logical records relating to differ-
               ent users.  The  maximum length of the packet  is 66 bytes
               and  the fixed  overhead  is 6  bytes.   Each user's  data
               within a packet has a two byte header.  The header is fol-
               lowed by the  data.  The packet can consist of  at most 20
               different users' data (one character per user).

               +-----------------------------//--------------------------+
               |         |       |       |       |       |       |       |
               |  2 byte | 2 byte|       |       | 2 byte|       | 4 byte|
               |  packet | header| data  | ----- | header| data  | check-|
               |  header |  for  |  for  |  ...  |  for  |  for  | sum   |
               |         | user 1| user 1|       | user N| user N|       |
               +----|----|---|---|---|---|---//--|---|---|---|---|-|-|-|-+

          B)   Buffer and Channel Allocation

               A circuit going into a network node is allocated one logi-
               cal channel  on the link  it uses  to "enter" the  node in
               TYMNET I.  Each link in a TYMNET  network has a fixed num-
               ber of channels  which are assigned when the  Node Code is
               generated.

               In TYMNET II,  the number  of links  is dynamically  allo-
               cated.  A channel is  assigned to a circuit  when the cir-
               cuit is built,  and the circuit retains  the exclusive use
               of that channel until the circuit is torn down.  If a cir-
               cuit passes through a node, it  is also assigned a channel
               on the  link it uses to  "exit" the node.  Enter  and exit
               are misnomers  in that the  circuit is full  duplex.  They
               are used here simply for descriptive purposes.

               Additionally, each circuit in a  network node is allocated
               a pair of buffers when the  circuit is built.  Each buffer
               handles the data  flowing in one  direction over  the cir-
               cuit.  These buffers are dynamic and require no space when
               empty.

               In TYMNET I, these channels and  buffers are assigned spe-
               cifically by the Supervisor.  In  TYMNET II, the Node Code
               allocates its resources dynamically.   The Supervisor sim-
               ply indicates  the nodes  through which  the circuit  must
               pass.

          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



          C)   Tearing Down and Building Packets

               When a packet is received with a good checksum, it is torn
               down by  the Node Code, and  the data for each  circuit is
               placed into the  buffer dedicated to that  circuit.  Like-
               wise, when  a packet is  being assembled  for transmission
               over a link, data  is removed from the  buffers which con-
               tain data to be transmitted across the link.

               A round  robin algorithm is  used to build  records.  That
               is, once  a logical  record is made  for a  given channel,
               that channel  will not be  serviced again until  all other
               channels with data present have been serviced.

          D)   Flow Control

               Flow control in  a TYMNET network  is performed on  a per-
               channel basis.  Periodically, each node examines the buff-
               ers  associated with  each  input  process.  If  a  buffer
               exceeds  a threshold,  the  process  is informed  to  stop
               inputting for that port until further notice.

               For the link control process, a passive flow control tech-
               nique is used.  Periodically, each node informs its neigh-
               bors on  which channel it  is permitted to  transmit data.
               Each  time permission  is given,  a fixed  amount of  data
               (based on the throughput class of this circuit) is allowed
               to be transmitted.


          3.2.2 Supervisor Nodes                ________________


          Supervisor nodes in a TYMNET network  perform a variety of con-
          trol and data collection functions.  A Supervisor node contains
          the Supervisor and PROBE programs, a  number of disk files, and
          several "slave" programs  which are used to  transfer data from
          the data  files over  network circuits  to the  Network Control
          Center.  This  section discusses  all the  program modules  and
          data files  on the  Supervisor node.  It  should be  noted that
          Supervisor nodes have disk storage capabilities because some of
          the files maintained are very large.


          A)   Supervisor Backup

               Since a  TYMNET network is centrally  directed, provisions
               must be  made for  backup if  the network  Supervisor goes
               down.   (It should  be  noted that  in  a TYMNET  network,
               existing paths are not affected in the event of a Supervi-
               sor going  down.)  The solution  to the  Supervisor backup
               problem is to provide a  hierarchy of several Supervisors.



                                              Network Software    Page 25



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               Up to seven  supervisor nodes may  exist in a  TYMNET net-
               work.

               Only one Supervisor is active at  a time, and it keeps the
               others dormant  by sending them messages  called "sleeping
               pills".  If  the active Supervisor  goes down, one  of the
               dormant Supervisors will  awaken without any  human inter-
               vention and take  control of the network.   Although sleep
               times are staggered, it  is possible to have  two Supervi-
               sors trying to take control of the network simultaneously.
               This  solution  is  handled gracefully  by  assigning  the
               Supervisors  numbers indicating  their  priority.  In  the
               case of a Supervisor fight, the one with the lowest prior-
               ity will put itself to sleep.

          B)   Network Takeover

               In order to  control nodes and carry  out the Supervisor's
               function of building virtual circuits, the Supervisor must
               know the capacity of all nodes, their link capacities, the
               network topology  and (for  TYMNET I  nodes) the  value of
               every permuter table entry.

               A Supervisor starting network takeover has no prior knowl-
               edge of the network topology.   The Supervisor first sends
               a takeover  command to  its own node,  and learns  of that
               node's capacity, the capacity of its links, every permuter
               table entry in that node and the neighbors of that node on
               each link.  The latter is the  basis on which the Supervi-
               sor discovers the topology of the network.  The Supervisor
               now sends  takeover commands to  each neighbor of  its own
               node.  As each of these nodes comes under complete control
               of the  Supervisor, each  of its  neighbors is  checked to
               discover previously unknown  nodes, and these are  in turn
               taken over.

               In this way the Supervisor learns the topology of the net-
               work, all  its capacities and  (from the  permuter tables)
               which resources are  in use.  The node  takeover times are
               approximately 4 seconds  for a TYMNET I node  and 1 second
               for a  TYMNET II node.   The time determining  factors are
               the number of nodes, the bandwidth  of links in the vicin-
               ity  of  the  Supervisor, the  number  of  permuter  table
               entries and the connectivity of  the network vis-a-vis the
               Supervisor's  own node.   From  a  control standpoint  the
               Supervisor views the network as  a tree.  The control tree
               comprises a subset of the links  in the network.  The bal-
               ance and depth of this tree is the measure of connectivity
               of the network in relation to the Supervisor's own node.

               If a  previously non-operational link  becomes operational
               it may reveal one or more nodes that were previously inac-

               cessible.  The  Supervisor would  then extend  the control
               tree by taking over these  newly discovered nodes.  On the
               other hand,  if a link  that is  part of the  control tree
               goes out,  the Supervisor  loses control  of the  nodes in
               that subtree.  The control tree  is then rebuilt to regain
               control of  all the lost  nodes that are  still accessible
               through the network topology.

          C)   Circuit Building

               The primary job of the Supervisor  is to build circuits in
               the network.   Either a TYMSAT port  or a TYMCOM  port can
               request the  Supervisor to build  a circuit.   The request
               contains   a  user   name,  a   destination  host   number
               (optional), the origination node and  port, and a password
               (optional).  The Supervisor verifies the  user name in the
               Master User Directory (MUD).  See the MUD record format in
               the  ISIS Validation  User's Guide.   The Supervisor  then                    _____________________________
               checks for the correct password, if any.  To check a pass-
               word at login,  it is ciphered and compared  to the cipher
               in the MUD.  If no host  number is specified, the Supervi-
               sor uses the "home" host from the MUD as the host.

               The Supervisor now knows the node  number of the originat-
               ing port and the node number  of the destination port.  It
               then computes the minimum  cost path for the  virtual cir-
               cuit.  Each link has a cost associated with it.  This cost
               is a  function of the link  bandwidth and the  presence of
               overload conditions as  shown in  the table  below.  Addi-
               tionally, the  TYMCOM (host interface program)  may report
               an arbitrary host cost factor which  can be used to effect
               load balancing across hosts.

                             LINK COSTS IN A TYMNET NETWORK

                  LINE          NORMAL       1-WAY         2-WAY
                  SPEED          COST      OVERLOADED     OVERLOADED

                  56000 bps       10           26            42
                   9600 bps       11           27            43
                   4800 bps       12           28            44
                   2400 bps       16           32            48

               The minimum cost path as computed  by the Supervisor is an
               optimization  of network  resources rather  than a  dollar
               cost.

               Once a  path has  been plotted,  the Supervisor  allocates
               buffer pairs  and network link  channels on each  node and
               link over which the virtual  circuit will pass.  In TYMNET
               I, messages are sent to each node along the path to inform
               the node code  to allocate the appropriate  resources.  In



                                              Network Software    Page 27



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               TYMNET II, a "needle" is sent  to the node of origination.
               The needle contains the node number of the nodes which the
               virtual circuit is  to pass through.  This  needle threads
               its way through the TYMNET II nodes.  As it passes through
               a  node, the  node code  allocates  the needed  resources.
               Once the circuit  is built, the Supervisor  sends the user
               name, originating node and port numbers, a session number,
               and the terminal characteristics  to the destination node.
               It also sends a message to  the destination host to inform
               it that there is a new login.

          D)   Closed User Groups

               Any user  can be restricted as  to where he may  enter the
               network and what facilities he may  reach.  An access pro-
               file is used by the Supervisor  to determine which hosts a
               user may access.  The access profile  consists of a set of
               definitions  each specifying  a class  of permitted  entry
               points and set of valid destinations.

               A class describes a set of  node numbers.  A user may have
               more than one class assigned.  A  group describes a set of
               hosts.   Each class  may have  one or  more groups  and/or
               hosts associated with it.  (A class must have at least one
               group or host.)

               At login time, the Supervisor checks  the node the user is
               logging in through  against the classes in  the user's MUD
               entry and  determines the legal destinations  according to
               the groups and hosts assigned to those classes.  Access to
               a host  or from a  node may be barred  to the user  if the
               right information  is not found.   In this way,  access to
               hosts from various locations by users  may be tightly con-
               trolled.

               Default (or  home) groups and/or  hosts must  be specified
               (at least one per definition).  If a user does not request
               a specific  host at  login time, the  user will  be logged
               into the default  host, according to the  definition.  For
               even greater control, there is also a flag in the MUD that
               forces a user to  the home group or  host.  Access defini-
               tion can  also be used  to create prioritized  routing and
               multi-target routing.

          E)   PROBE

               A special program called PROBE runs  on the network Super-
               visor node.  PROBE  can be logged  into directly  and pro-
               vides the user  a means of monitoring  and controlling the
               network.  The PROBE commands are  discussed in more detail
               in the PROBE  User's Guide.  In general,  PROBE allows the                      ___________________
               user to check the status of the network or a network node.



                                              Network Software    Page 28



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               For example, PROBE can be used to find the number of orig-
               inations, terminations,  and pass-throughs  for any  node.
               PROBE can also be used to shut  a link or host so that new
               circuits will not  be built over the link or  to the host.
               Finally, PROBE can  be used to inspect the  error log file
               on the network  Supervisor.  Using the log  command, PROBE
               can be used  to monitor significant events  on the network
               in real time.

          G)   Error Log

               The  Supervisor maintains  a circular  file  on disk  into
               which it stores special messages received from the various
               network  nodes  or  hosts.  These  messages  include  such
               things as  duplicate hosts in  the network,  node takeover
               errors, host down, link down,  permuter table errors, link
               retransmission  errors,  MUD  error  found,  and  operator
               retake requests.   The error log  data may be  examined in
               real time by PROBE.

          H)   Accounting Information

               The TYMCOM  program controlling  the termination  port for
               any  circuit periodically  sends the  Supervisor a  record
               containing  accounting information.   In particular,  when
               the circuit is built, the originating  node and port, ter-
               minating node  and port,  user name,  session number,  and
               terminal type  are sent to the  Supervisor.  Approximately
               every 15 minutes another record is sent which contains the
               session number and the numbers of input and output charac-
               ter sent over the circuit since the last update.  Finally,
               when the  session is terminated,  a record  containing the
               reason for  termination is sent  to the Supervisor.   If a
               session is not terminated normally because of a failure of
               the node at  which the circuit terminates,  the session is
               treated (after an 8 hour wait)  as if it had terminated at
               the time the last update record was received.

               Accounting data  is received  by the  Supervisor in  frag-
               ments, not as complete records.   Each fragment is identi-
               fied  by a  session number.   The Supervisor  puts a  time
               stamp on  each fragment  as it  is received,  but does  no
               sorting of data fragments.

               The accounting data is sorted by the Raw Accounting Merger
               program (RAM).  RAM builds a  circuit to the slave program
               ACCOUNT,  which resides  on the  network Supervisor  node.
               ACCOUNT accesses and  reads the accounting data  file, and
               sends the data to RAM.  RAM sorts the accounting fragments
               into complete  session records,  and writes  the completed
               records to  tape.  Refer to the  RAM User's Guide  for the                                                ________________
               format of accounting records.



                                              Network Software    Page 29



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               As with the error log file, the  accounting file is a cir-
               cular file and thus the data  must be read before the file
               wraps around  and data  is lost.   This does  not normally
               pose a problem because the file is  very large, and a TYM-
               NET network can currently store up  to seven days worth of
               data before any is lost.  Also, to prevent loss of inform-
               ation, messages are stored in  the error log file whenever
               the  accounting file  exceeds 50  percent  of its  storage
               capacity.


          3.2.3 TYMSATs                _______


          Terminal control processes in a  TYMNET network are referred to
          as TYMSATs.  One of these processes  in the the customer's net-
          work is  the asynchronous  terminal controller  or Asynchronous
          TYMSAT.  There is both  a stand-alone version of  the Asynchro-
          nous TYMSAT and version which runs under ISIS.

          The Asynchronous  TYMSAT runs in  conjunction with  the 32-port
          Asynchronous board and is used  to handle asynchronous terminal
          ports which can run at speeds of 110 to 1200 baud.  The Asynch-
          ronous  TYMSAT can  control both  ASCII  type teleprinters  and
          2741-type terminals.

          A)   Terminal Identifier

               When the Asynchronous TYMSAT detects  the physical connec-
               tion of the terminal  (DSR and CAR high) it  prints a mes-
               sage asking the user to type a terminal identifier charac-
               ter (TID).  This message is printed  at either 300 or 1200
               baud depending on  the system  generation.  The  TID indi-
               cates the terminal speed and carriage return delay charac-
               teristics of the terminal.

          B)   Terminal Logon

               Once the terminal  type is determined, the  TYMSAT prompts
               the user for the login character stream.  This it sends to
               the network Supervisor for verification.

          C)   Control Characters

               A TYMNET network initially assumes that terminals are full
               duplex, odd parity, and cannot  respond to X-ON/X-OFF flow
               control characters.  To change  these characteristics, the
               user  may type  certain control  characters  in the  logon
               stream.   These characters  and  the  Auto-TID option  are
               explained in more detail in the TYMSAT Reference Manual.                                               _______________________





                                              Network Software    Page 30



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



          D)   Echo Control in the TYMSAT

               The Asynchronous TYMSAT echoes most characters back to the
               terminal  unless the  terminal has  indicated  it is  half
               duplex by entering the appropriate  control character dur-
               ing logon.

               For full duplex terminals,  the Asynchronous TYMSAT echoes
               most characters  to the terminal.  For  certain characters
               such as the tab character,  however, the Asynchronous TYM-
               SAT defers the echoing to the host.

          E)   Automated Logon Facility

               The Asynchronous TYMSAT  design provides for a  user to be
               automatically connected to his destination  with no inter-
               action or  address selection on  his part.   This provides
               service for the specialized user who has no need to access
               multiple hosts.  This facility is described in more detail
               in the TYMSAT Reference Manual.                      _______________________


          3.2.4 Host Interfaces                _______________


          Host  interface programs  which run  in  network nodes  include
          Asynchronous TYMCOMs, X.25, X.75, 3270, and 2780/3780/ The typ-
          ical network contains  two types of host  interfaces; Asynchro-
          nous TYMCOM and  X.25 Each of the host  interfaces is discussed
          in general  terms here  and explained  in more  detail in  host
          interface supporting documentation.

          A)   Asynchronous TYMCOM

               The Asynchronous TYMCOM is  the simplest interface between
               a host  system and  a TYMNET network.   It appears  to the
               host system  as a bank  of low speed  asynchronous modems.
               This program runs under ISIS on the TYMNET Engine and uses
               the Asynchronous Board as its  I/O interface card.  It can
               emulate ASCII  teleprinter or EBCD or  correspondence code
               2741 devices.   The Asynchronous TYMCOM can  handle speeds
               of up to 1200 baud.  Refer  to the TYMCOM Reference Manual                                                  _______________________
               for more detail on the TYMCOM.

          B)   X.25 Host Interface

               The network connects to a customer  host's front end proc-
               essor over  a synchronous  link using  the X.25  protocol.
               This protocol is  handled by a program running  in an ISIS
               job slot and using the Synchronous  Card as its I/O inter-
               face.  The  X.25 program  conforms to  the CCITT  standard
               X.25 specifications.  Over  this link, it is  possible for

          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               programs running on the customer's  host to build circuits
               to hosts  on the network.  This  is done, for  example, by
               the accounting collection program  on the customer's host.
               It is also possible for terminals  on the network to build
               circuits through the network and over the X.25 link to the
               customer hosts.   The SIO card is  used as the  I/O device
               for HDLC framing.  Bisync framing  can be done through the
               SIO  card   or  the  synchronous   card.   Refer   to  the
               X.25_Interface_Reference_Manual  for more  information  on               ____ _________ _________ ______
               the X.25 interface.

          C)   3270 Host and Terminal Interface

               The 3270 Interface  is a host and  terminal interface that
               provides a 3270 connection for  TYMNET network users.  The
               interface provides services in  three basic modes:  native
               mode,  virtual  terminal  mode,  and  virtual  host  mode.
               Native mode provides a 3270 terminal user with access to a
               3270  support host  through the  network, eliminating  the
               need for dedicated leased long  distance lines.  In native
               mode, the 3270  terminal user  also has  multi-host/multi-
               application access on 3270 support computers.  This elimi-
               nates the need for duplicate  lines or equipment to access
               separate applications on the same or separate 3270 support
               computers.  Virtual terminal mode provides a 3270 terminal
               user  access to  any computer  on a  TYMNET network,  even
               ASCII support hosts.   The virtual host mode  provides the
               users of  certain ASCII CRTs  access to  computers running
               3270 applications.   This provides economical  dial access
               to both 3270  hosts and ASCII time sharing  systems from a
               single terminal.   The 3270  host and  terminal interfaces
               each   run    in   an   ISIS    slot.    Refer    to   the

          D)   2780/3780 Interface

               The 2780/3780 interface  is a host and  terminal interface
               which provides  the 2780, 3780,  and 3770  series terminal
               user with access to host computers with 2780/3780 terminal
               support.  This service functions only in native mode, pro-
               viding an  economical connection between  remote terminals
               and hosts through  a TYMNET network.  This  eliminates the
               need  for  dedicated  leased  long  distance  lines.   The
               2780/378o host and terminal interfaces each run in an ISIS
               slot.  Refer  to the  2780/3780_Reference_Manual for  more                                     _________ _________ ______

          3.2.5 Network Gateways                ________________


          Another type  of interface program in  a TYMNET network  is the
          network Gateway.

          A)   TYMNET to TYMNET Gateway

               The typical  customer network contains the  TYMNET gateway
               program.  This  program runs  in a  job slot  on a  TYMNET
               Engine and uses the ports on  the Synchronous Board as its
               I/O interface.  The TYMNET Gateway  appears to the network
               in which it  resides (i.e., the network in  which the ISIS
               node resides) as a host on the node.  This node may origi-
               nate and  terminate circuits.  The TYMNET  Gateway appears
               to the network which it talks to over the synchronous line
               as a dead-ended node which controls a host.  That host may
               both originate and terminate circuits.

               As  is typical  of network  gateways,  the TYMNET  Gateway
               forces the  user to  go through a  logon procedure  to get
               access to the second network.  If the user had to logon to
               the first network, it appears to him as a double logon.

          B)   X.75 Network Interface

               A TYMNET network  may be connected to  another Public Data
               Network (PDN)  over a full  duplex, synchronous  data link
               using the  X.75 protocol.  This  protocol conforms  to the
               CCITT X.75 standard,  and is a program running  in an ISIS
               slot using the  SIO Card as its I/O  interface.  Using the
               X.75 link, a  customer logged in to a host  in another PDN
               may build  circuits to  a host in  a TYMNET  network.  The
               X.75 architecture is almost identical to that of X.25, and
               is an extension  of X.25.  For further  information, refer
               to the X.75_Interface_Reference_Manual.                      ____ _________ _________ _______



          3.2.6 ISIS                ____


          ISIS has been mentioned several  times in this specification as
          an operating environment which allows  a node to contain TYMNET
          Node Code plus  one or more of the  TYMSAT, TYMCOM, Supervisor,
          or Gateway functions.   This section provides a  description of
          the purpose, usages,  and external design  of the  ISIS (Inter-
          nally Switched Interface System) system.

          ISIS was  defined in  order to develop,  debug, and  deploy new
          interfaces on network  nodes while protecting these  nodes from
          possible faults in these interfaces.



                                              Network Software    Page 33



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



          ISIS is an  operating system:  it is  a set of rules  as to how
          the interfaces are to be constructed, and  how they are to com-
          municate with each other.  ISIS is not a network node or imple-
          mentation of TYMNET technology.

          ISIS divides the machine into partitions,  or slots.  Slot 0 is
          expected to  have special  properties and  abilities, including
          the routing of circuits within  the machine, and the collection
          of  diagnostic and  accounting information  (i.e., the  network
          node code).

          ISIS treats  the network node  code as just  another interface.
          The node  code has  special properties  only when  executing in
          slot 0.   These properties include  the routing  and monitoring
          functions relating  to the network supervisor.   When executing
          in a slot other  than slot 0, the interface  performs the func-
          tion of a gateway to a TYMNET network.

          A)   The Kernel

               The control center of ISIS is  the Kernel, a process which
               provides  ultimate  control  of  hardware,  including  the
               scheduling of other processes.

               Interrupts have absolute priority  in the machine.  During
               intervals when  no interrupts are active,  other processes
               are active.  These are either  the Kernel, or some process
               to which the Kernel has temporarily assigned the machine.

               These processes are, for the purposes of scheduling, inde-
               pendent jobs, even though a set  of processes may be work-
               ing together, as  a slot.   These processes  form a  hier-
               archy.

               The top level consists of foreground processes.  These are
               intended to  communicate with  the  interrupt level  proc-
               esses, and thus  must be scheduled at  frequent intervals,
               to permit timely responses.  To accomplish this, each time
               the Kernel tries to schedule a  job, it first searches the
               queue  of foreground  jobs to  find which  one should  run
               next.  If none should go  immediately, the time, until the
               next foreground process is to run,  is made available to a
               background process.

               At the  bottom level are  the background jobs.   These are
               the  work-horses, which  perform the  major  effort of  an
               interface.   Background jobs  actually  fall into  several
               categories, which  the Kernel's  scheduler treats  identi-
               cally.

               The true background job, as already mentioned, is the main
               effort of a given interface.  In addition, there are a set



                                              Network Software    Page 34



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               of System Debugging Tool (SDT) jobs.  Each of these can be
               logged into  through the  network or  locally and  used to
               control, modify, debug, or reload a given set of processes
               (a slot).

               Each slot has  an SDT, a foreground, and  a background job
               associated with it  (NOTE: not all jobs  associated with a
               slot need be active concurrently).

               An intermediate  level job  is the  DISPATCHER.  The  Dis-
               patcher is run each time a non-SDT background job runs and
               is used to set up that background  job for its next use of
               the machine.   In particular, the Dispatcher  switches the
               output which was produced by  that slot to the appropriate
               destination slots.

          B)   The Dispatcher

               The heart of ISIS is the dispatcher.  The primary function
               of  the Dispatcher  is to  act in  a manner  similar to  a
               switching node, except that, instead of talking to several
               network lines, it talks to several interfaces.  Subsidiary
               functions  are to  perform  network  accounting, and  such
               other functions  which are  conveniently centralized.   It
               does not  have any knowledge  of the unique  properties of
               specific interfaces, except that  the interface associated
               with slot 0 has the capability  to perform routing, and is
               the repository for diagnostic, accounting,  and other mes-
               sages.

               Each interface has  a set of descriptors which  it uses to
               talk to the Dispatcher, and may  have a translator to con-
               vert its  requests and  messages to  the standard  format.
               Each interface runs as one  or more independent jobs under
               the  Kernel, sharing  time-slices  with  the rest  of  the
               interfaces.  The  Memory Access Controller  (MAC) prevents
               each interface  from destroying another  interface because
               of illegal memory stores.  The  Dispatcher checks the data
               flow to insure that if the interface  is in error, it dam-
               ages only its own subset of circuits.

          C)   Inter-Process Communications

               The Dispatcher and  any particular interface must  talk to
               each other.   Because the  processes  are running  concur-
               rently, the Dispatcher  may interrupt a process  after any
               instruction.  The intercommunication  has, therefore, been
               designed such that  this is expected.  The  two directions
               of traffic must also be independent.

               The buffering mechanism  used is a ring  buffer, which one
               process fills and  the other empties.  No  specific const-



                                              Network Software    Page 35



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               raint is  placed on the  size of  the buffer by  ISIS, and
               there is  no reason that an  interface input ring  must be
               the same size as its output ring.

               The slot 0 interface includes the  set of functions relat-
               ing  to inter-node  communications,  circuit routing,  and
               diagnostic information.  Each interface, including slot 0,
               has a  set of  permuter  tables,  controlled by  the  Dis-
               patcher,  which tell  the  Dispatcher  which port  of  one
               interface is connected to what port of another.

               The Dispatcher receives commands and  data from slot 0 and
               forwards them  to the appropriate  interface, constructing
               internal circuits as necessary.  The  Dispatcher also per-
               forms the internal accounting function.

               If an  interface requests a  circuit to another  host, the
               Dispatcher will make a connection to the slot 0 interface.
               If that circuit  turns out to be an  internal circuit, the
               Dispatcher  will  do the  necessary  interconnection  from
               source to  destination such that  the data  flows entirely
               within the Dispatcher without bothering  the slot 0 inter-
               face.

               The internal format of data being transmitted must be uni-
               form for all interfaces.  To this end, a message format is
               used.   Each message  originating at  an  interface has  a
               header.  The header specifies the port number and the mes-
               sage type.  For  each message type, the  message length is
               fixed.  One class  of messages would  be pure  data trans-
               fers:  type 1 means 1 character follows, 2 = 2, ..., 80x =
               128d; others mean specific control  messages, such as DIS-
               CONNECT,  etc.   Since  the  predominance  of  traffic  is
               expected to be data, a receiver  can eliminate much of the
               normal logic  required to examine each  character, because
               this information  is incorporated  into the  message type.
               In  particular, the  Dispatcher  (and  other processes  as
               well)  can process,  or  move messages  from  one ring  to
               another, with the  major overhead occurring in  looking at
               the message  header and  determining the  destination.  If
               there is room at the destination, the message can be moved
               very quickly without  excess character-by-character  over-
               head.

          D)   Routing

               Slot 0, as  noted above, has special  properties involving
               routing,  accounting,  and   diagnostic  collection.   The
               actual implementation  is dependent  on the  usage of  the
               particular ISIS configuration.





                                              Network Software    Page 36



          Network Specifications                            July 11, 1980



               In a self-contained configuration, all circuits are inter-
               nal and the routing algorithm may be very simple.

               When the slot  0 interface is part of  an external network
               (as in  a gateway), circuits  may originate  and terminate
               both internally and externally.  The interface is now more
               complex since, in  addition to internal circuits,  it must
               also  perform some  measure of  external  routing and  may
               additionally support external traffic which passes through
               the interface, but which is not terminated (in the view of
               the external network) there.

               In  a network  with centralized  control,  all routing  is
               deferred to the control of the Supervisor, which also pro-
               vides  centralized accounting  and diagnostic  collection.
               Use is also  made of the Supervisor's  ability to validate
               requests  and  to  permit or  reject  certain  connections
               (Closed User Groups).

          E)   External Communications

               Each logical interface  may require some sort  of hardware
               driver  (although this  is not  strictly necessary)  which
               could imply  loss of security  (memory violation  of other
               jobs)  for each  new  interface  generated.  However,  the
               majority of  drivers would seem to  fall into one  of four
               communication  classes:   asynchronous,  synchronous,  bit
               stuffing (SDLC), and channel or  alternately, some sort of
               special  I/O device  driver (printer,  disk, etc.).   ISIS
               supports drivers for all these devices.  The value of cen-
               tralized hardware  drivers, although  less efficient  than
               allowing each process to drive  its own devices, outweighs
               efficiency considerations.   The inter-process  protection
               afforded, the ability  to change or share  devices without
               rewriting each process using that  device, and the lack of
               specialized knowledge  (on the part  of the  process) make
               the processes much easier to develop.  Details of specific
               logical  interfaces relate,  not  to  the actual  transfer
               mechanism used, but  to the buffer format,  a detail which
               is protectable, under the MAC,  from inter-process corrup-
               tion.   An interface  which corrupts  its buffer  handling
               hurts only itself, not  the hardware, or the  other inter-
               faces with which  it is sharing the  hardware.  Thus, each
               interface is constrained to  request actual data transfers
               from the drivers, through the Kernel.

          SECTION 4.0 NETWORK CONTROL CENTER COMPONENTS          _____________________________________________


          The NCC  hardware configuration  consists of  a combination  of
          TYMNET Engines  in the  private network  with special  ISIS job
          slots, and limited support from NCC programs running on a Tyms-
          hare PDP-10 through a network gateway from TYMNET.

          The purpose  of the NCC system  is to provide a  monitoring and
          control facility for the customer's network.


          SECTION 4.1 Accounting          ______________________


          The accounting function of  the NCC consists of  a process run-
          ning on an ISIS node.

          The Raw Accounting  Merger (RAM) program runs in a  job slot on
          an ISIS node.  RAM collects accounting information from network
          Supervisor nodes,  sorts the information into  complete session
          records, and records them on magnetic tape.  For more detail on
          this program refer to the RAM User's Guide.                                    ________________


          SECTION 4.2 User Validation          ___________________________


          The user validation programs are used to  add a new user to the
          CUD or  to modify the  information concerning an  existing user
          entry in  the CUD.  The  ISIS Validation Program  (VAL) updates
          the CUD residing on a network  Supervisor node and copies these
          updates to  the MUDs for  the other network  Supervisors.  This
          program     is      described     in     detail      in     the

          SECTION 4.3 Network Assembler and Debugger          __________________________________________


          The Network Assembler  and Debugger (NAD) is  a cross assembler
          used to assemble, load, and debug  network code running on TYM-
          NET  Engines.  Normally,  NAD is  used to  create binary  files
          which are then loaded by the LOADII program.

          NAD also  provides the  user with the  ability to  log in  to a
          debug module in  any network node.   The symbol table  is main-
          tained on  the NCC  host computer and  thus accessible  to NAD.
          Using the symbol table and the circuit to the network node, the
          user has  the ability to  perform online symbolic  debugging in
          any network node which runs on a TYMNET Engine.

          This program is currently only available  on a TYMNET host com-
          puter.   A detailed  description of  NAD  can be  found in  the
          ISIS_Programmers_Reference_Manual.          ____ ___________ _________ ______


          SECTION 4.4 Downline Loader          ___________________________


          The program LOADII which  runs on the NCC can be  used to down-
          line load or upline  dump network nodes.  This  program is cur-
          rently only available on a TYMNET host computer.  The operation
          of  this program  is explained  in  more detail  in the  LOADII                                                                   ______

          SECTION 4.5 Network Simulator (SIMNET)          ______________________________________


          SIMNET is a model of a TYMNET network which is designed to help
          the user configure  their network through optimal  placement of
          nodes and lines.  This program only runs  on a TYMNET host com-
          puter.  It  is used  mostly for  monitoring network  growth and
          planning for network expansion.  It is not a real-time model of
          the  network but  runs from  a session  file which  is used  to
          describe network  traffic.  Typically, this  session file  is a
          derivative of  the network  accounting information  produced by
          the Accounting Merger program on the NCC host computer.

          The Network Simulator gives you the  ability to make trial net-
          work configuration changes, try  them out with a  fully config-
          ured network, and then try taking  different links or nodes out
          of the network to determine what  would actually happen to net-
          work  traffic  if  that  event   really  occurred.   SIMNET  is
          described in more detail in supporting documentation.
