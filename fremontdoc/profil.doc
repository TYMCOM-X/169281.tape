               SECTION I - WHY A NETWORK PROFILE DATABASE?



             The  central  components  of  Tymnet's  business,  from   an
        operations  view,  are the sites where network nodes and customer
        hosts are located.  The Network Profile Database is  designed  to
        provide  a  standard  definition  of network locations and of the
        machines and contact people associated with these locations.

             The specific functions of this database include:

                * Unique identification of each network site.
        
                * Assignment of node and host numbers.
        
                * Identification of hardware, software, and contacts,
                  both Tymnet and customer.
        
                * Classification of the various machines and interfaces 
                  in the network by hardware and software type.

             Part of the value of the Network Profile is its  ability  to
        promote  sharing  of information among groups within the company.
        By defining the most basic components of the network, it provides
        a solid foundation for many other in-house information management
        functions.  It also provides another step towards standardization
        of terminology and its usage within the company.

             If we have a dependable representation of  sites  and  their
        machines,  this  data  can then be used to validate other systems
        such as TYMDATA and TOPICS (parts inventories), T-BILL (telephone
        bill  reconciliation), PIMS (fixed asset accounting), Validations
        and Billing databases, and Marketing tools  and  analysis.   This
        can be accomplished in the form of on-line files and/or reports.

             The  structure  of  the  database  is  modular  and   easily
        expandable.   By  adding  internal  files,  it can be upgraded to
        represent the circuits that connect sites and  machines,  or  the
        ports that provide access to the network.  

             Finally, it is a vehicle to track and record network changes
        on  a day-to-day basis.  With over 800 Tymnet and customer sites,
        over 1000 nodes, and well over 1000 host interfaces, this  is  no
        small  task.   The  database is designed to work in parallel with
        the Order Entry System to  record  and  display  changes  to  the
        network as they occur.

            SECTION II - WHAT IS IN THE NETWORK PROFILE DATABASE?



             This  database  is  a  screen-oriented  MAGNUM  system.   It
        consists  of  thousands  of RECORDS, one for each SITE, NODE, and
        HOST in the network, as well as  Tymnet  and  customer  CONTACTS.
        Each  record contains specific FIELDS.  For example, SITE records
        contain fields such as:  company name, address, phone, etc.  NODE
        records  contain fields such as:  node number, hardware, software
        etc.

             The point of this section is to get you thinking in terms of
        SITE, NODE, HOST, and CONTACT records.  It is also to familiarize
        you with  the  fields  belonging  to  each.   Understanding  what
        belongs  in  each field is a prerequisite for using the database.
        For this reason the glossaries and charts appear here and not  in
        the back of the document.  




         This section is divided into three parts:
 
                           A) SITE RECORDS 
                           B) NODE RECORDS
                           C) HOST RECORDS
 
         Each part contains the following: 
 
                           --A sample record
                           --A chart of field characteristics          
                           --A glossary of fields for that record    
Network Profile Database                                           Page 7












        <<< PART A - SITE RECORDS >>>




             A network site is  anywhere  a  node  or  host  computer  is
        physically  located.   If  the  node  and its connecting host (or
        hosts) are in the same location, the site record will be the same
        for  all of them.  If they are in different places, there will be
        a record for the node site and a separate record  for  each  host
        site.




             There are a few instances in  the  network  where  a  Tymnet
        machine  is  sitting in an office or building not owned or leased
        by Tymnet or one of our customers.  (We  may  have  use  of  this
        small space by mutual agreement with the owner).  In these cases,
        the company shall be listed as  Tymnet  and  a  remark  shall  be
        entered clarifying the situation.




             Our sites are broken down into 5 main classes.   Site  CLASS
        is  used to define sites by their "logical hierarchy" in the net,
        by the applications they support.  We also identify each site  by
        type.   Site  TYPE  is  used to define sites by their real estate
        requirements (eg.  footprints, square footage, etc).  Both  CLASS
        and  TYPE  appear  as  fields  in  the  site record and are fully
        described on page 13.

        <<< PART B - NODE RECORDS >>>






             A  network  node  is  a  mini-computer  which  serves  as  a
        communications   processor.    It   may   be   a  Tymnet  Engine,
        Mini-engine,  Micro-engine,  Varian,  Interdata,  etc.,  and  may
        function  as  a  Tymsat,  Tymcom,  Base, Micro-base etc.  In very
        general terms, a node can be thought of  as  an  intermediary,  a
        processor that originates, terminates, or switches traffic.  This
        database contains a separate record for each node in the network.





        This is a sample of a NODE record:

                        <<<GLOSSARY OF NODE FIELDS>>>


        >>>NODE NUMBER:  Each time a new  node  is  brought  up,  Network
        Engineering  assigns  a  unique number to it.  The number remains
        assigned to that node throughout its life in the network.

        An up or downgrade in the  node's  software  (from  Tymnet  I  to
        Tymnet  II  or  vice  versa)  is one instance where a node number
        changes.  In this case, once the new software is up  and  running
        in that node, the new number takes effect and the old one becomes
        available to be reassigned to another node.  

        The node number for a particular machine may also change if it is
        assigned to another customer, or moved to a new location.
        ***NOTE: Node numbers under 2000 employ Tymnet I software.
                 Node numbers over 2000 employ Tymnet II software.


        >>>PROPERTY NUMBER:   Each  piece  of  Tymnet  equipment  in  the
        network  will  be assigned a property number (or fixed asset tag)
        on the basis of a physical inventory conducted  by  the  Auditing
        department.   This number will allow the department to keep track
        of what we own.  It will remain the same for a particular machine
        even if its node number changes.


        >>>NODE NAME:  Each node in the network has a name in addition to
        its  number.   Our database uses the Netpatrol naming convention.
        An explanation of this naming convention appears in Appendix A on
        page 47.

        For new nodes coming into the net, the node name WILL NOT  appear
        in  the  database until a completed Project Report is received by
        the Database Administration Group.  Once DBA dtermines  that  the
        node  is  up  and  running,  the  name  will be added to the node
        record.  Therefore, if you are in the database and you see a node
        record  without  a  node name, you'll know the node is not yet in
        the network.  

                         Sample Entries: DALLAS_DI
                                         BUBBRD_WB
                                         HNYWEL_XI
        
        ***NOTE:  Another commonly used node name (ND__) appears  in  the
        database in the Code Location field.  


        >>>SITE IDENTIFIER:  In the node relation, this is a  data  field
        pointing  to  the  site  where  the  node  is located.(For a more
        detailed explanation see definition on page 10).


        >>>REGION:  This refers to the Network Field  Engineering  region
        in  which  the  node  or  host  site resides.  The three domestic
Network Profile Database                                          Page 18


        regions are:  Eastern, Central, and Western.  We abbreviate them:
        ENFE,  CNFE,  and WNFE.  The international region is abbreviated:
        INTL.  (A breakdown of NFE regions by state appears in Appendix B
        on page 48).


        >>>NODE SOFTWARE:  This field refers to the code that runs in the
        machine and defines the function of the node only.
                Sample Entry: Tymsat


        >>>SERIAL NUMBER:  This refers to the unique number  assigned  to
        node machines by Tymshare Manufacturing.


        >>>NODE HARDWARE:  Node hardware refers to the node in  terms  of
        the physical machine configuration (eg.  V72, Interdata etc).  
                Sample Entry: ENGINE


        >>>MEMORY TYPE:  This refers to the type of memory that the  node
        contains.  It may be core or semi-conductor.  


        >>>CORE SIZE:  This is the size (in kilobytes) of online  storage
        for the node.
                Sample Entry: 1024


        >>>CODE LOCATION:  This refers to the directories, host  systems,
        and  file  names  where the compiled node code can be found.  The
        Tymnet directory (maintained by the Project Implementation group)
        contains code for public net machines only.  The location of node
        code for international and lab machines would be various  private
        directories.
                Sample Entry: (TYMNET:70)ND2424.BND


        >>>SUBNET NUMBER:  The Database Administration  group  assigns  a
        unique  numerical identifier to each subnetwork within TYMNET.  A
        subnetwork is a set of nodes within the public net  dedicated  to
        one  customer  application.  A subnetwork uses the public network
        supervisor but confines all traffic within the specified  set  of
        nodes.


        >>>KERNEL HOST NUMBER:  All engines running ISIS (or  Tymnet  II)
        software  have  a  Kernel host.  The kernel is the portion of the
        Engine (slot 0)  that  controls  and  schedules  all  other  jobs
        (running  in  slot 1, 2, 3, etc.).  Each Kernel host has a unique
        number.  The database does NOT contain host  records  for  kernel
        hosts.
Network Profile Database                                          Page 19


        >>>NODE SOFTWARE VERSION:  This identifies exactly which  version
        of  node  code  is  currently  running  in  the  node.   It  also
        immediately tells us the function of  that  node.   We  now  have
        approximately 80 different versions of node software in the net.

        ***NOTE:  The version number will be periodically updated by  the
        Database  group  from  a  file  produced  directly from the Probe
        utility.
                Sample Entry: 140447


        >>>RESTART INFO:  This field gives Network Control and  our  NFEs
        the necessary information for restarting or reloding a node.  The
        three valid entries are:
        
                REMOTE  =  Node may be restarted from a remote location
                MANUAL  =  Node may only be started on-site
                RELOAD  =  Node requires reloading 


        >>>NETWORK NUMBER:   This  database  is  capable  of  maintaining
        information  on  more than one independent network.  Each network
        is assigned its own number.  The network being accessed  defaults
        to  the  Tymnet  Public  Network (network 1) unless otherwise set
        using the SET ENVIRONMENT command.

        Once the environment is reset to another network, the  user  will
        be  viewing  only  those  nodes and hosts in that network.  To go
        back to the Tymnet Public Network, the environment  must  be  set
        back to 0.  (See SET ENVIRONMENT command on page 40).


        >>>OLD NODE:  This is the previous number of a node that has been
        upgraded.   For example, old node 1723 appears in the node record
        for node 2433.  This tells us that node 2433 was once 1723.


        >>>EFFECTIVE DATE:  In  this  field  you  will  see  one  of  the
        following:

          1.  A DATE - This tells when the node became operational.

          2.  "PENDING" - This means  that  the  node  is  in  the  order
              process and not yet in the net.


        **NOTE:  If no date is entered at the time a new node  record  is
        established  the  program  will  automatically enter "PENDING" in
        this field.


        >>>ORDER NUMBER:  This gives us the number of the LAST order with
        which this node was associated.  (For more complete order-related
        data you will want to access Command 6:  ORDERS).
Network Profile Database                                          Page 20


        >>>LAST CHANGED:  This date marks the last time a change was made
        to the node record.  


        ***NOTE:  The last 4 fields in this glossary DO NOT appear on the
        combined  screens  (where the node record is combined with a site
        record, for example).  They DO appear when displaying or printing
        a node by itself, or when printing out a hard copy.

        <<< PART C - HOST RECORDS >>>



             The term "HOST" actually applies to two  different  concepts
        in  the  network.   A  host can be a customer or Tymnet computer,
        external to the node, which serves as a termination  point  of  a
        session  OR it can be an internal, software-defined portion of an
        Engine.


             An example of the  first  type  would  be  Host  2700  which
        belongs to Software Arts, Inc., located in Wellesley, MA.  (It is
        connected by a synchronous line to  node  2557,  located  at  our
        Tymnet site in Salem, NH).


             An example of the second type would be host 832, one of  our
        OnTyme  hosts,  which  physically  resides  inside  node  2316 in
        Fremont.  We may summarize Hosts in the following way:
        
        
        
             Hosts EXTERNAL to                Hosts INTERNAL to  
                 the node                         the node 
             -----------------                -----------------
        1) may be at the same site            1) Kernel hosts             
        
        2) may be at a different site         2) Other diagnostic hosts
                                                 like TMCS
         
                                              3) Host applications like
                                                 OnTyme, Netpatrol, MUX
        
        


        This is a sample of a HOST record:

        >>>HOST NUMBER:  Each time a new  host  is  brought  up,  Network
        Engineering  assigns  a  unique number to it.  The number remains
        assigned to that host throughout its life in the network.   If  a
        customer cancels service, or for any reason the host is taken out
        of the network, its number becomes available to be reassigned  to
        another host.


        >>>NODE NUMBER:  (See explanation on page 17).


        >>>SITE IDENTIFIER:  In the host relation,  site  id  is  a  data
        field  pointing  to  the  site where the host is located.  (For a
        more detailed explanation see page 10).


        >>>REGION:  (See explanation on page 17).


        >>>SLOT NUMBER:  All Engines running ISIS software have  internal
        slots  which appear in numerical order.  ISIS allows each slot to

        >>>INTERFACE TYPE:  This  is  the  slot  code  that  defines  the
        function  of  a  given  slot.   Most slots function as interfaces
        (hence, the name of this field) but there are exceptions.

        What qualifies as an interface type in this database?   All  host
        and terminal interfaces, gateways, and any host product that runs
        on an engine and has its own host number in and of itself.

        A list of these interface software types and their  corresponding
        product  names  can be found in Appendix D on page 50.  These are
        taken  directly  from  the  Network  Technology  Division   (NTD)

        >>>EFFECTIVE DATE:  In  this  field  you  will  see  one  of  the
        following:

          1.  A DATE - This tells when the host became operational.

          2.  "PENDING" - This means  that  the  host  is  in  the  order
              process and not yet in the net.


        **NOTE:  If no date is entered at the time a new host  record  is
        established  the  program  will  automatically enter "PENDING" in
        this field.


        >>>ORDER NUMBER:  This gives us the number of the LAST order with
        which this host was associated.  (For more complete order-related
        data you will want to access Command 6:  ORDERS).


        >>>LAST CHANGED:  This date marks the last time a change was made
        to the host record.  


        ***NOTE:  The last 3 fields in this glossary DO NOT appear on the
        combined  screens  (where the host record is combined with a site
        record, for example).  They DO appear when displaying or printing
        a host by itself, or when printing out a hard copy.

        SECTION III- WHO USES THIS DATABASE?  WHAT DO THEY USE IT FOR?

             This database is intended for the  general,  in-house  user.
        Anyone  at  Tymnet  who  has  a  need for site, node, and/or host
        information can access this database to display, print, list,  or
        report  the  data  that  they  need.   It  was  designed with the
        following main users in mind:
        
        
                                Customer Services
                                Network Control
                                Network Field Engineering
                                Technical Support
                                Network Engineering
                                Telecommunications
                                Project Implementation
                                Validations
                                Marketing/Sales
        
        
                     Each of these groups has different needs
                        which are mentioned briefly below:



        <<<CUSTOMER SERVICES>>> This group is first in  line  for  Tymnet
        customers  experiencing  problems with the network.  They use the
        database to locate the proper Tymnet  contact  for  the  customer
        having problems.


        <<<NETWORK CONTROL>>> Monitoring the network on a 24-hour  basis,
        Netcon  needs quick access to site, node, and host records at all
        times.  The Supervisor informs them of a  downed  node  or  host.
        The  database  then provides them with the extra information they
        need to trouble-shoot problems.  This is especially critical  for
        maintaining service after hours.


        <<<NETWORK FIELD ENGINEERING>>> Our  NFEs  are  concerned  mainly
        with hardware at the node level.  The database supplies them with
        various  node  hardware-related  details  as  well  as   accurate
        information needed to access our sites.


        <<<TECHNICAL  SUPPORT>>>  Our  Communications   Consultants   are
        concerned  mainly  with software on the customer node and/or host
        level.  The database supplies  them  with  slot,  interface,  and
        other software-related details.
Network Profile Database                                          Page 27


        <<<NETWORK ENGINEERING>>> This group needs to  be  familiar  with
        our  sites  and  the  machines  at  each one in order to engineer
        incoming service and reconfigure existing service.  The  database
        provides  them  with  this  information  as  well  as  a tool for
        assigning node and host numbers.


        <<<TELECOMMUNICATIONS>>> Telcom needs accurate site  and  contact
        information  to insure that telephone installers will have access
        to our sites.


        <<<PROJECT  IMPLEMENTATION>>>   In   monitoring   and   executing
        completion  of  orders, P.I.  needs access to all site, node, and
        host information.  The database also provides them  with  a  tool
        for checking code versions for host interfaces and nodes.


        <<<VALIDATIONS>>> Validations uses the database to maintain their
        list of Customer Identifiers (C.I.D.'s) and Validations usernames
        for our customers.


        <<<MARKETING/SALES>>> Our Marketing and Sales groups need  to  be
        familiar  with  the  various types of host systems and interfaces
        deployed in our network.  This database gives them the  necessary
        host  and  interface  information needed to give our customers an
        idea of the range of services available in the network.

                        SECTION IV: HOW DOES IT WORK?


        PART A:  ACCESSING THE DATABASE

             Using your own username or  your  group's  username,  you'll
        need  to  log into the host where the database resides (currently
        System 56, backed up by 54).  At the exec prompt (-) type:   -GFD
        NETDB.   Once  you  are  in  this  directory  you'll need to call
        MAGNUM.   You  do  this   by   typing:    -MAGNUM.    This   will
        automatically put you into the database.

             From there the program will ask you if you are using  a  425
        terminal.   The  answer  to this question is a simple "Y" or "N".
        (It is possible to set your environment so that the program won't
        ask  you this question each time.  See SET ENVIRONMENT command on
        page 40).  Non-425 mode is nearly identical to the 425 mode  with
        a few exceptions.  (Non-425 mode is explained on page 45).

             After you have entered a "Y" or "N", the COMMAND screen will
        come  up.   This  is  the  main  screen  or  primary level of the
        database containing all the available commands  (Display,  Print,
        List,  etc).   At  this  time, there are 4 levels of access which
        determine the commands available to users of the database.   They
        are:
        
                  Level 0 = Commands 1 through 11 (the default level)
                  Level 1 = Commands 1 through 12
                  Level 2 = Commands 1 through 13
                  Level 3 = Commands 1 through 17 (DBA only)
        

             Once you choose a command, you will continue on to the  next
        level  of  the  database,  the  OPTION screen.  The OPTION screen
        contains all the available options  for  a  given  command.   For
        example, the OPTION screen for the PRINT command allows you to:
        
                        1.  Print site
                        2.  Print node/site
                        3.  Print node
                        4.  Print host/site
                        5.  Print host
                        6.  Print node/site/host/site
                        7.  Print node/host.
        

             Once you choose one of these options you will continue on to
        the third or last level of the database, the RECORD screen.  This
        is where the record is actually displayed, added, or changed.  (A
        diagram of this entire structure appears on page 46).
Network Profile Database                                          Page 29







        PART B:  CURSOR MOVEMENT



             The next thing you need to know is how to move around on the
        screens.  The following keys will work in this program:
          
        
        
                  TAB..........jump forward from field to field
        
        
                  BACK TAB.....jump backwards from field to field
        
        
                  ARROWS.......jump up, down, or side-to-side one 
                               character
        
        
                  The following keys will work in ADD or CHANGE commands:
        
        
        
                  SPACE BAR....will delete next character
        
        
                  CHARACTER DELETE...will delete the current character
        
        
                  LINE ERASE.........will erase the entire field
        
        
        
        ***NOTE:  Do not use the ESCAPE key while in the program.  If you
        need to exit at any time use  Function-Q  or  Function  -L.   The
        following  Function keys are the only ones that will work in this
        program:
Network Profile Database                                          Page 30







                         <<< FUNCTION CHARACTERS >>>>





            1.  FUNCTION - SPACE...........The function key  followed  by
                the  space  bar.   This  will signal the host computer to
                accept the input you have entered on the screen and  send
                you on to the next logical screen in the sequence.


            2.  FUNCTION - R...............The function key  followed  by
                the  letter  R.   This will send you back to the previous
                screen.  When done  twice  it  will  send  you  back  two
                screens.


            3.  FUNCTION - C...............The function key  followed  by
                the  letter  C.   This  will  send  you  back to the main
                command screen.


            4.  FUNCTION - P...............The function key  followed  by
                the  letter  P.  This will print out a record when in the
                DISPLAY, LIST, CHANGE, or ADD command.  Be sure  to  turn
                your  printer  on before executing a function-P, and turn
                it off afterwards.  


            5.  FUNCTION - Q...............The function key  followed  by
                the  letter Q.  This will take you out of MAGNUM and back
                to the exec level prompt (-).


            6.  FUNCTION - L...............The function key  followed  by
                the  letter L.  This will take you back to Please Log In.

                        16. Purge
                        17. Read mail
        
        The following is a description of each command:

        (1) DISPLAY:

             The program will only display one  record  at  a  time.   To
        display  a record, access the DISPLAY command and then choose the
        appropriate OPTION:  Display  site,  node,  host,  or  node/host.
        Once you have displayed a record you may:
 
                -display another record
                -use Function-R to go back to the command screen
                -use Function-P to print out the record
 


            <<< GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISPLAY COMMAND >>>

            1.  -- Display node, host, and node/host also show  the  site
                information.

            2.  -- To display a site you need to know the  site  ID.   (A
                brief  report  containing all site IDs can be printed out
                for your personal use.  See BRIEF REPORTS on page 33).

            3.  -- To display  a  node  record  (or  a  combination  node
                record) you need to know the node number.

            4.  -- To display  a  host  record  (or  a  combination  host
                record) you need to know the host number.  

            5.  -- On display node/host:  Function-P will only work after
                ALL the hosts for that node have been displayed.
Network Profile Database                                          Page 32


            6.  -- Display node/host is a way of viewing  a  node  record
                followed by all of its attached hosts.  Since the program
                only displays one record at a time, you  will  be  seeing
                the  node record first, followed by all the host records,
                one at a time.

                This can be a long process if the  node  has  many  hosts
                attached  to it.  To find out first you might want to use
                LIST NODE.  This will show you the  node  record  with  a
                list  of  its  attached  hosts.   The  record won't be as
                detailed but it's faster.

            7.  -- Remember:  After the node or site record is listed you
                may  print  it  out (using function-P) if you want a hard
                copy.




        (2) PRINT:

             This command is handy for printing out  a  hard  copy  of  a
        record  when you don't want to take the time to display it first.
        Once you've accessed the PRINT command  and  chosen  one  of  the
        options  (site,  node,  host,  or  node/host)  you will print the
        record out to the terminal.  THE PROGRAM  WILL  NOT  DISPLAY  THE
        RECORD FIRST.



             <<< GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRINT COMMAND >>>

            1.  -- To print a site record you need to know the site ID.

            2.  -- To print a node (or combination node) record, you need
                to know the node number.

            3.  -- To print a host (or combination host) record, you need
                to know the host number.

            4.  -- After you have entered one of the  above  numbers  and
                are  ready to print out the record, REMEMBER TO TURN YOUR
                PRINTER ON.

            5.  -- After the record has been printed,  REMEMBER  TO  TURN
                YOUR PRINTER OFF.  

Network Profile Database                                          Page 33


        (3) LIST:  This command has two options:
        
                 List node - enables the user to view a node with a
                             list of the hosts attached to that node.
        
                 List site - enables the user to view a site with a list
                             of all the nodes and/or hosts at that site.


              <<< GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIST COMMAND >>>

            1.  -- To list node you need to know the node number.

            2.  -- To list site you need to know the site ID.

            3.  -- Remember:  After the node or site record is listed you
                may  print  it  out (using function-P) if you want a hard
                copy.  




        (4) REPORT:

        The database can produce the following REPORTS:
        
                    1. BRIEF reports
                    2. DETAILED reports
                    3. SPECIAL reports 
        
        >>> BRIEF REPORTS:

             Brief reports are very handy to have around.   They  can  be
        easily  generated  by the database and typed out on your printer.
        You'll probably want to generate and type out the ones  you  need
        fairly often to insure that you have data that is up-to-date.

        > OPTIONS:  There are 3 options on brief reports:  SITE, NODE, or
        HOST.  The fields contained in each one are listed below.

        >  SELECTION:   Once you have chosen the type of report you want,
        you'll need to decide how it is to be  selected.   The  selection
        criteria are as follows:
        
              1. ALL      2. ENFE      3. WNFE      4.CNFE      5. INTL
              6. WATS     7. NYATS     8. CATS      9. SEATS    10. NEATS
        
        The selection criteria produce reports containing data from  just
        a  portion  of  the  network,  or  from  the entire network.  For
        example, a node report selected by CNFE contains just  the  nodes
        in  the Central Field Engineering region.  A host report selected
        by SEATS contains just the hosts in the South East  Tech  Support
        Area.   If  your selection is "ALL", the report will contain data
        from the entire network.   You  may  choose  only  one  selection
        criteria.

        > SORT:  The last choice you have is how  you  want  your  report
        sorted.  

        1.  SITE REPORTS can be sorted:

                 1. Numerically by Site id           Filename = SITE1.LST
                 2. Alphabetically by Company name   Filename = SITE2.LST
                 3. Alphabetically by State/City     Filename = SITE3.LST
                 4. Numerically by Sales Rep #       Filename = SITE4.LST

        2.  NODE REPORTS can be sorted:

                 1. Numerically by Node #            Filename = NODE1.LST
                 2. Alphabetically by State/City     Filename = NODE2.LST
                 3. Alphabetically by Hardware type  Filename = NODE3.LST
                 4. Alphabetically by Software type  Filename = NODE4.LST

        3.  HOST REPORTS can be sorted:

                 1. Numerically by Host #            Filename = HOST1.LST
                 2. Numerically by Node #            Filename = HOST2.LST

           <<< STEPS FOR GENERATING AND TYPING OUT YOUR REPORTS >>>

        1.  Access the Report command, choose your option, selection, and
            sort criteria.  The program then generates the report for you
            (this takes a few minutes or longer depending on  the  system
            load).

        2.  After the report is generated,  the  directory  and  filename
            will  appear  at  the  bottom of your screen.  (See filenames
            listed above).  Notice that  the  file  is  written  to  YOUR
Network Profile Database                                          Page 35


            directory.

        3.  At this point, perform a Function-Q to get back to  the  exec
            level and GFD back to your directory.

        4.  Set your printer on compressed type, issue the -TTY WIDTH 132
            command, and type out the file.

        5.  ***NOTE:  It usually takes about 10  minutes  to  type  these
            reports  out.   Also,  if  you  want to save the file for any
            reason RENAME IT TO SOMETHING ELSE because the next time  the
            program  generates  that report it will write over the one in
            your directory.




        >>> DETAILED REPORTS:

             Detailed reports are useful when you need to  access  entire
        records but don't want to bother with the screens.  These reports
        can be thought of as hard copies of the entire  database,  sorted
        differently.

             Because they contain entire records,  they  are  very  large
        (500  pages  and  up),  so  keep that in mind.  It is possible to
        select the report by NFE region (which will print  out  only  the
        records  in  one  region,  for example WNFE).  This is one way of
        getting around the large size.

             These reports may be generated out of the  database  in  the
        same  way  as  the  brief  reports,  so you'll want to follow the
        instructions just given.  One difference is that you'll  want  to
        spool  the  detailed  reports  (or  run  them off on a high speed
        printer) so as not to tie up your terminal.

        There are currently 6 detailed reports available:

          1. SITE REPORT (sorted by site id)        Filename = SITE10.REP
          2. SITE REPORT (sorted geographically)    Filename = SITE20.REP
          3. NODE REPORT (sorted by node #)         Filename = NODE30.REP
          4. HOST REPORT (sorted by host #)         Filename = HOST40.REP
          5. NODE/HOST REPORT (sorted by node #)    Filename = NODE50.REP
          6. NODE/HOST REPORT (sorted by site id)   Filename = NODE60.REP
          7. SITE REPORT (sorted by company name)   Filename = SITE70.REP
          

        ***NOTE:  When node and/or host  records  following  one  another
        share  the  same site ID, the site information will be printed in
        the first record only.  Keep this in mind  when  reading  through
        the detailed reports.

        >>> SPECIAL REPORTS:

             Special reports are those designed with a specific user  (or
        users)  in  mind.   Their contents vary depending on the needs of
        the user.  These  reports  are  generated  out  of  the  database
        (similar  to  all  other  reports) and are available for anyone's
        use.

             The SPECIAL REPORTS feature is useful because it allows  new
        reports  to be added to the database as needed.  (In other words,
        we are not limited to a static set of reports).  A special report
        may be requested by filling out a database modification sheet and
        submitting it to Database Administration.  Presently,  there  are
        three special reports available:

        > THE NODE LIST 

             This report takes the place of the NODE LIST currently being
        maintained  by  Network  Engineering.  To generate it and type it
        out, follow the procedures mentioned  above  for  brief  reports.
        Once generated, it is written to your directory with the filename
        NODELI.  

             It can be generated and typed out as often as necessary  and
        will   contain   all  current  nodes  and/or  hosts  assigned  by
        Engineering and  added  to  the  database  each  day.   The  list
        contains the followng fields in this order:

                                Node #
                                Old node # (when applicable)
                                Order #
                                Effective date
                                Company name
                                City/State
                                Host #(s) 
                                Kernel host #
        


        > THE ISIS REPORT

             This report contains all of the Isis nodes  in  the  network
        grouped  by  NFE  region.  The program will ask you to select the
        NFE region you wish to look at (WNFE, ENFE, etc).  You  may  also
        select the whole network.

             The report is sorted  alphabetically  by  state  within  the
        region.   For  example,  if you generate an Isis report for WNFE,
        you can expect to see the Isis nodes in Alaska first, followed by
        the Arizona nodes, etc.  

             Each  record  contains  the  company  name  and  other  site
        information,  the  Isis node number, and each slot on the machine
        in numerical order (with corresponding host  numbers).   It  also
        contains  the  type  of  interface  running  in each slot and the
Network Profile Database                                          Page 37


        customer that it belongs to.  A typical Isis node record in  this
        report would look like this:
        
        = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  = = = = = = = =
        **HONEYWELL                        SITE ID: 0936
          5115 N. 27TH AVE.                PHONE: 602/862-8000
          PHOENIX, AZ
        
          ==> Node: 3172       HNYWEL_XI              Memory: SEMI 1024

        = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
             

             The procedure for generating and typing out Isis reports  is
        the  same as that for all brief reports.  The filenames for these
        Isis reports are as follows:
        
        WNFE.IS  -  CNFE.IS  -  ENFE.IS  -  INTL.IS  -  ALL.IS


        > THE SITE SUMMARY

             This special report contains a count of all nodes and  hosts
        at  each  site  in the network.  For example, it tells us that at
        site 974 (Timesharing Consultants Inc.  in Tucson)  there  are  2
        nodes and 1 host.

             The sites are sorted alphabetically by state,  and  then  by
        city.  (All international sites appear at the front of the report
        sorted alpahbetically by city).

             Keep in mind that this is a COUNT of nodes and hosts at each
        site;   It  does  not  contain a listing of node or host numbers.
        For instructions on how to generate and type out the Site Summary
        follow  those  given  previously for brief reports.  The filename
        for the Site Summary report is:  SITE30.REP.



        (5) SEARCH:

             This command allows the user to search the  entire  database
        for  specific information.  For example, you may want to know how
        many X.25 interfaces we have connected to IBM 3033 computers.  Or
        you  may  want  to  know  how  many  network sites we have in Los
        Angeles.  The SEARCH  command  will  supply  answers  to  similar
        questions.

             At the site level it is presently possible to search  for  a
        particular  contact name, company name, or a particular city.  At
        the  host  level  it  is  presently  possible  to  search  for  a
        particular  interface  (X.25,  Async,  etc.), a host manufacturer
        (IBM, NCR, Amdahl, etc.), a host model (3000 series,  750,  6303,
Network Profile Database                                          Page 38


        etc.),  or  host software type (KMS11, COMMPRO, etc).  It is also
        possible  to  search  for  front  end  manufacturer,  model,   or
        software.

        > SUBSTRINGS:  It is not necessary to type  in  the  entire  word
        when  doing  a  search;  the program will accept and search for a
        sub-string.  For example, I want to search  the  database  for  a
        site  in  Pennsauken,  NJ,  but  I  don't  remember  how to spell
        Pennsauken.  By simply typing in "ken", the program will be  able
        to  find  it.   (Remember,  though,  that  every  other city that
        contains the letters "ken" would also be found).


             Although the program will  accept  as  few  as  one  or  two
        characters  for  a  sub-string  search, it is not advisable since
        it's likely to come back with  more  than  you  want.   The  more
        specific you can be on sub-strings, the better.



             <<< GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SEARCH COMMAND >>>

            1.  -- When searching for a particular company name, city, or
                contact  name,  the results will be listed out for you on
                the screen.

            2.  -- If you want a hard copy of these  results,  perform  a
                Function-P,  but  wait  until all the instances have been
                displayed on the screen.

            3.  -- If there are 0 records found, the program will  notify
                you with a message on the bottom of your screen.

            4.  -- When searching for particular interface or host  data,
                it  is  advisable  to start out with a broad category and
                gradually become more specific.  For example,  you  might
                first  ask  to  search  for all IBM hosts.  Once it comes
                back with those, ask for  all  model  3033's  etc.   This
                tends to be a faster way to go about it.

            5.  -- After a  particular  interface,  host,  or  front  end
                search has completed, the program gives you the option of
                1) printing the data out at the terminal, 2) writing  the
                data  to  a file, or 3) displaying only the customer data
                at the terminal.




        (6) ORDERS:

             The ORDERS command  allows  the  user  to  find  all  orders
        relating  to  any  given  site, node, or host.  At the time a new
        record is added to the database, the corresponding  order  number
        is  also  entered  (if known).  The database then keeps a running
Network Profile Database                                          Page 39


        history of these order numbers and  supplies  them  to  the  user
        under the ORDERS command.  

             The command first prompts you for site, node, or host.  Your
        selection  is  based  on the corresponding order history desired.
        (i.e.  Suppose you wanted to know all the orders relating to node
        3515,  your  selection would therefore be NODE).  Once the orders
        are found, they are listed out on the screen.  If a hard copy  of
        the results is desired, perform a Function-P.



        (7) OLD NODES:

             This command allows the  user  to  access  the  node  number
        history  for any currently or previously existing node(s).  Given
        a current node number, the program finds its old number and tells
        whether  it  has been reused or not.  Given a previously existing
        node, the program finds its current node  number.   For  example,
        the  number history for an EXISTING (sample) node might look like
        this:
        
        The following node number changes have occurred for NODE: 7777
        
                1234 changed to 7777 on 06/11/82
        

             This number history shows that node 7777 was, at  one  time,
        node 1234.  On 06/11/83 the number was changed in the database to
        7777 to reflect the upgrade.  I now know the previous number  for
        this existing node.  

             Now suppose that I knew an old number  (170),  but  not  the
        number  it was upgraded to.  I enter the number (170) and this is
        what the database reports back:
        
        The following node number changes have occurred for NODE: 170
        
                170 changed to 2110 on 04/22/82
        

             This tells me that 170 was upgraded to 2110 in April of  82;
        I now know its existing number.  From this data we may also imply
        that number 170 then became available and was probably reassigned
        to another node.

             Although not every detail is supplied, a node number history
        can still be a good place to start when doing research on a node.
        It can point the user in the right direction.

        (8) MAIL TO DBA:

             This command allows users of the database to  send  mail  to
        the  Database  Adminstration  group  for  any  needed assistance,
        question, problem, suggestion, etc.  The message space allowed is
        5  lines  per  message  and  the date and time of the message are
        recorded by the program.

             The Database Administration group encourages  all  users  to
        take  advantage  of  this  feature.  It is there for your use and
        allows us to better support you by means of direct communication.
        All messages will be pulled daily and addressed accordingly.



        (9) SET ENVIRONMENT:

        > TERMINAL TYPE:

             The SET ENVIRONMENT command  allows  the  user  to  set  the
        terminal type being used to avoid being prompted for it each time
        the database is entered.  It also allows  the  user  to  set  the
        desired  network  for  viewing, otherwise the program defaults to
        the Tymnet public network.  Once either of these  has  been  set,
        they can be reset at any time.

             If you wish to set the terminal type for your  own  username
        and  you  consistently access the database on a 425 terminal, set
        your environment to 1.  If you consistently access it on a 444 or
        a  126  or any other terminal, set your environment to 2.  If you
        go back and forth between terminal types leave it set on 0.   The
        reason  for  this  is because if the environment is set for a 425
        and you go home and log into it on a 126, it will be set  up  for
        screen mode and you won't be able to get out.

             If the username you use to access the database is used by an
        entire  group,  check and make sure all members of the group have
        the same terminal type to avoid locking anyone out.  IF  YOU  ARE
        UNSURE, LEAVE IT SET ON 0.

        > NETWORK:

             The second part of the SET ENVIRONMENT  command  has  to  do
        with accessing multiple networks, one at a time.  The database is
        designed to  allow  the  user  to  view  records  in  independent
        networks as well as the Tymnet public network.  

             Setting your environment to a specific network will drop you
        automatically  into  that  network.   There you will see only the
        records contained within it.  You will  remain  in  that  network
        permanently  unless  you  re-set  your network back to the Tymnet
        Public Network (Network 1).

        (10) INSTRUCTIONS:

             Selection of this command puts you back at the beginning  of
        the  database  where the instructions are displayed on the screen
        for review.



        (11) NEWS:

             The NEWS command explains changes  to  the  Network  Profile
        software since the last major version release.



        (12) CHANGE:

             The change command is used to change fields  in  an  already
        existing record.  For example, when a node's software is upgraded
        from T-I to T-II many fields in the existing node record need  to
        be  changed, or when a contact leaves a company, a new name needs
        to be put in its place through the change site command.

             All users with access level 1, 2, or 3 may change fields  to
        update  the  data  in an existing site, node, or host record.  To
        change a field, simply access the CHANGE command and then  choose
        the  appropriate  OPTION:   change  site,  change node, or change
        host.  Once the record appears on the screen, you may use the TAB
        and ARROW keys to move around and make your changes.  (See Cursor
        movement on page 29).  


             <<< GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHANGE COMMAND >>>

            1.  -- To change site you need to know the site ID.  (A brief
                report  containing  all  site ID's can be printed out for
                your personal use.  (See Brief Site Report on page 33).

            2.  -- To change node you need to know the node number.

            3.  -- To change host you need to know the host number.

            4.  -- If you attempt to make a change to  a  field  and  the
                program  won't  allow  it,  its  because  that  field  is
                assigned by the program only.

        (13) ADD:

             The ADD command is used to add a new  site,  node,  or  host
        record  to  the  database.   This occurs in the following manner:
        The Database Administration unit is copied on all Sales sign-offs
        and all incoming orders are immediately reviewed.  Existing sites
        are verified and new sites are established (if necessary) at this
        time.

             The  Network  Engineering  unit  then  configures  the   new
        service, pre-assigns the node and host number(s), and establishes
        the corresponding node and host record(s) in the database  before
        signing off their path.  (These new records established by either
        DBA or Neteng are almost immediately reflected in the  Node  List
        as it is generated and updated each night).

             If the data is entered at the onset of an order, how can  we
        determine when the site, node, or host is actually up in the net?
        The EFFECTIVE DATE field either tells  us  it  is  "pending",  or
        gives the date when it became operative.  This is how we tell the
        difference between sites, nodes, and hosts that are  not  yet  in
        the net, and those that are.

             This entire procedure for adding records allows the database
        to function parallel to the OES as a funnel, sorting all incoming
        data directly from orders into the correct records right from the
        start.    It  allows  the  the  database  to  be  a  centralized,
        company-wide source of data for all new sites, nodes,  and  hosts
        being ordered, long before they are actually in the net.

             Secondly, because many users  have  the  ability  to  access
        records  and  update  information through the CHANGE command, new
        records can be maintained throughout an order's path as  well  as
        after the service is up and operative.  Existing records can also
        be maintained as new data is acquired.

             As a direct result  of  the  ADD  and  CHANGE  features  and
        procedures,  the  database  truly functions in a partnership with
        the OES.  Both programs are maintained and accessed on  the  same
        host  computer.  The data from one system feeds and is maintained
        in the other.  They are interdependent.


              <<< GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ADD COMMAND >>>

            1.  -- You cannot add a site,  node,  or  host  that  already
                exists.

            2.  -- To add a site you need to know the zip code where  the
                site is located.

            3.  -- When entering a 9-digit zip  code,  the  program  will
                only  accept  the first 5 digits initially.  Once you get
                into the record you can add the remaining digits.
                     -- To add a node or host you need to know either the
Network Profile Database                                          Page 43


                site  id  where  each  is located, or the zip code of the
                site.




        (14) DELETE:

             Records are deleted out of the database for various reasons.
        For  example,  when  a customer cancels service or a lease is up,
        the sites and machines involved need to be removed.  If an  order
        was  involved  in the canceling of service and subsequent removal
        of a record, the order number may be  entered  at  the  time  the
        record is deleted.  This enables the program to keep track of all
        order  numbers  involved  with   all   records.    The   Database
        Administration unit performs ALL deletions from the database.

             Data can be deleted by accessing the DELETE command and then
        choosing  the  appropriate  option:   Delete  host,  delete node,
        delete site.


             <<< GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DELETE COMMAND >>>

            1.  -- A site may  not  be  deleted  if  the  database  still
                contains node or host records attached to that site.

            2.  -- A node record may not be deleted if the database still
                contains host records attached to that node.




        (15) HISTORY:
        
                        HISTORY OPTIONS AVAILABLE:
                        -------------------------
        
                        1.  Date
                        2.  User
                        3.  Site
                        4.  Node
                        5.  Host
        

        1.  DATE:  This option prints out all activity that  occurred  in
            the  database  on any given day.  It is a history which lists
            the records that were changed, added,  or  deleted  from  the
            database  on  that  day.   The  records  themselves  are  not
            displayed, only the site ids,  node  or  host  numbers  which
            uniquely identify each one appear on the list.  The user must
            specify the date for  which  the  history  is  desired.   The
            format for entering the date is MM/DD/YY.
Network Profile Database                                          Page 44


        2.  USER:  This option prints out all activity of a given user of
            the  database.   It is a history which lists the records that
            were changed, added,  or  deleted  by  that  user  between  2
            specific  dates.   The  records themselves are not displayed,
            only the site  ids,  node  or  host  numbers  which  uniquely
            identify each one appear on the list.

            (For example, I may want to know how many records were  added
            to  the  database by the username NETDB between August 01 and
            August 31, 1983).  If no dates are specified, the default  is
            a total history for that user.

        3.  SITE, 4.NODE, or 5.HOST:  Each time one of these  records  is
            added,  changed,  or  deleted, the program keeps track of it.
            If the need arises to track this information  on  a  specific
            record, the options 3, 4, or 5 may be used.


        **NOTE:  The history command may be  accessed  by  the  DBA  unit
        only.



        (16) PURGE:

             This  command   allows   the   Database   Administrator   to
        periodically  remove  all  site,  node,  or host history from the
        database from a specified date, backwards.  It was designed  with
        conserving system storage in mind.



        (17) READ MAIL:

             This allows DBA to type out all mail received from  database
        users.

        PART D:  NON-425 TERMINAL USERS

             This database is designed for  general  use  on  a  Tymshare
        Model  425  terminal.   It is possible, however, for those of you
        with 444's, 125's, 350's etc.  to access  the  database;   you'll
        just be slightly limited in what you can do.
        
        
        
                The following commands are available
                on non-425 terminals:
        
                        1. Print
                        2. List
                        3. Report
                        4. Search
                        5. Orders
                        6. Old nodes
                        7. Mail to DBA
                        8. Set environment
                        9. Instructions
                       10. News
        
        
         

             The program executes these commands for you in generally the
        same  way  it  does  for  425  users.   You'll  want  to read the
        information on them (just covered  in  PART  C)  if  you  haven't
        already.   There  are  a  few  things  in  the  program  that are
        different for you:


            1.  -- You  won't  use  Function-space.   After  you  make  a
                selection,  type  a  carriage return and the program will
                continue.


            2.  -- You won't use Function-P.  Use the  PRINT  command  in
                its  place.   The  PRINT  command  will  be  your  way of
                "displaying" a record.


            3.  -- You won't use function-C, Q, or  L.   Use  a  carriage
                return  (or  multiple  carriage  returns)  to  return  to
                previous levels or exit back to the exec level.


            4.  -- In terms of any detailed reports you  may  want,  make
                sure you spool them so that your terminal is not tied up.

                                  APPENDIX A
                      << NETPATROL NAMING CONVENTION >>

             This system gives Network Control,  NFE/Ops,  Tech  Support,
        etc.   a  way  to  quickly  identify a node and know a little bit
        about it just by looking at the name.   (All  nodes  that  employ
        this  naming  convention  are  ND nodes in the old convention and
        their code is located under ND).The names have 9  characters  and
        look like this:
        
                                  SDIEGO_LI
                                  ALASCO_HI
                                  BLUBEL_PA  
        
        
        Let's break them down into 3 parts:

            1.  The first 6 characters = CITY OR CUSTOMER NAME.  If it is
                a Tymnet or Tymshare node, the first 6 characters will be
                the  city  where  it  is  located.   (These  are  usually
                accessable  24  hours).   If  it  is a customer node, the
                first 6 characters will be the customer name.  (These are
                usually  accessable  only  during  customer  hours).  The
                first 6 characters are ALWAYS followed by an underscore.

            2.  The 8th character = NFE/OPS DISTRICT OFFICE
                
                           A = China Basin (San Francisco)
                           B = Boston (New England district)
                           C = Chicago                      
                           D = Dallas                       
                           H = Houston                      
                           L = Los Angeles                  
                           N = New York
                           P = Philidelphia
                           S = Santa Clara
                           T = Seattle
                           V = Denver

                   NETWORK PROFILE DATABASE -- USER'S GUIDE

                     ADDENDUM:  Version 3-0, March, 1984




                           SUMMARY OF NEW FEATURES


        Version 3-0 of the Network Profile Database adds  several  enhanced
        capabilities to the system.  These new features include:

            1) Access to information on synchronous circuits between  nodes
               and from nodes to hosts.

            2) New reports in the SPECIAL REPORTS package

            3) Other new background features, such as:

                  * Automatic node and host number assignment
                  * Table of valid cities
                  * Basic statistics package
                  * Table update program
                  * Canadian provinces
                  * Large report generation in NETDB




                             NETWORK CONNECTIONS


        The primary objective of Version 3-0 is  the  addition  of  network
        connection  information  to  the  Network  Profile  data structure.
        Information on  the  following  types  of  network  connections  is
        included in this release:

               NODE-TO-NODE leased lines
               NODE-TO-NODE hardwires and memory shufflers
               NODE-TO-HOST leased lines

        A future release is planned which will incorporate asynchronous and
        terminal  oriented  connections (corresponding to the current Ports
        Database).

        SOURCES OF DATA
        ---------------

        Network connection data is being provided for display only in  this
        release  of the Network Profile.  Direct update of this data within
        the Profile is scheduled for implementation as part of Release 4-0.

        Network connection information is fed into  the  Profile  from  two
        sources:

            1) The Topology Database (NODE.TEK and LINE.TEK).   This  is  a
               1022  database  maintained  by  the  Database Administration
               group.  It is updated  from  project  reports,  orders,  and
               Network  Control  shift summaries.  Circuits are verified in
               Probe before being entered into Topology.

            2) The Paradyne Analysis Database (ANAL.DMS).  This is  another
               1022  file  of  line and drop information for circuits under
               the Paradyne analysis  system.   It  is  maintained  by  the
               Network Quality Control group.

        The information from these two sources  is  copied  onto  the  host
        system  for Network Profile on a daily basis via a PERP job.  There
        it is loaded into MAGNUM relations where it is  accessible  through
        LIST, SEARCH, and REPORT commands.


        NEW FIELDS
        ----------

            CIRCUIT NAME:   For  leased  lines  this  is  the  alphanumeric
               designator  used  by  ATT  Long  Lines  or  the  local  Bell                                       _
               operating company to identify the circuit (eg.  FDEA123456).
               This  field  also  designates  hardwires  as  HW  and memory
               shufflers as MS.

            TROUBLE PHONE:  This is the telephone  number  used  to  report
               line   outages   and   problems  to  the  telephone  company
               responsible for the circuit.

            BPS:  Line speed as measured in bits per second  (eg.   9600  =
               9600 bits/second;  56KB = 56,000 bits/second.

            LINE:  Logical line indicator for the Paradyne analysis system.
               A  line  on  this  system  can monitor up to 15 master/slave
               pairs, or up to 30 individual Paradyne modems.

            DROP:  The logical  address  for  each  modem  monitored  by  a
               particular line in the Paradyne analysis system.

            TRIBUTARY:  Tributary is the drop  address  for  slave  modems.
               Its  primary  use  is for multi-drop synchronous circuits to
               indicate the relationship  of  several  slave  modems  to  a
               single master.

        COMMAND CHANGES
        ---------------

            LIST:  The list command now gives two new options:   LIST  NODE
               CONNECTIONS  and  LIST  HOST CONNECTIONS.  These two options
               work identically in 425 and non-425 modes.  Having  selected
               an  option  in  425 mode, the user will find that the screen
               features are turned off and the  terminal  accepts  carriage
               returns rather than function key sequences.

               The following example  illustrates  use  of  the  LIST  NODE
               CONNECTIONS option.

               connections  via  leased  lines.   Each   of   these   eight
               connections  is  given a temporary "Line ID" for purposes of
               this display.]

            SEARCH:  The SEARCH command has a new  option,  SEARCH  CIRCUIT
               NAME.   This  option  allows  the  user  to enter any set of
               characters from a circuit name.  The program will  return  a
               list  of  circuits  that  contain  the  specified  character
               string.

               The example below illustrates the SEARCH CIRCUIT NAME option

            REPORTS:  A variety of new reports are  available  for  network
               connections.  They can all be created by first selecting the
               BRIEF REPORT option in the  REPORT  command,  and  then  the
               NETWORK  CONNECTIONS  option.   There  is no real difference
               between 425 and non-425 modes as far as creating reports  is
               concerned.

               Several of  these  reports  are  quite  large,  and  require
               significant  time  and system resources to create.  In these
               cases the program will indicate to  the  user  that  a  file
               containing  the  report already exists on line, and the date
               that it was last created.  If the date is recent enough  the
               user  may  choose  to  type  out the existing report without
               spending the time to create a newer version.

               As with the other brief reports, these new reports  are  all
               132 columns wide.  They can be SPOOLed if the user specifies
               LARGE form size and 66 lines per page in the SPOOL  request.
               If  they  are  output  to  a printer the user should set TTY
               WIDTH 132 and set the printer on compressed type.

               The available  reports  and  their  individual  options  are
               briefly described below.



            1) CIRCUIT MAP - This report comes in two basic  versions.   It
               is  similar  to  the  Circuit Map formerly produced from the
               1022 version of the Topology  Database,  but  contains  more
               site details.

               a) Node/host sort.  This version of the  Circuit  Map  lists
                  circuits  by node and then by host.  Connections for each
                  node are grouped together, first sync ports, and then SIO
                  ports.  The neighbor node or host on the other end of the
                  circuit is listed with site  details,  as  well  as  line
                  speed,  trouble  reporting  number, and Paradyne analysis
                  information.  Host connections are listed in  a  separate
                  section  following  the  node connections.  Every line is
                  listed twice in this report, once  for  each  end  point.
                  This report can be selected by NFE region or Tech Support
                  area.

               b) Circuit name sort.  This version contains one  entry  for
                  each  leased line (no hardwires or memory shufflers).  It
                  is much smaller than the node/host version,  and  has  no
                  selection options.

            2) LEASED LINE REPORTS - These reports group  leased  lines  by
               site,  and  show  details  of nodes and hosts connected to a
               particular site as well as a mileage figure  calculated  for
               each  circuit.  Three options for this report are all lines,
               Tymnet to customer lines, and customer  to  customer  lines.
               All versions can be selected by region or area.
Network Profile Database                                            Page 61
ADDENDUM


            3) SITE CONNECTIONS - This report comes in  only  one  version,
               though  it  can  be  selected  by region or area.  Lines are
               grouped by node  or  host  within  each  site,  and  include
               hardwires  and  memory  shufflers  as  well as leased lines.
               Thus, from this report it is possible to  see  how  machines
               within  a  site  are interconnected, as well as how the site
               itself is connected to other network locations.




                               SPECIAL REPORTS



        The following is a listing of the reports available in the  special
        reports  package.   These  reports  can be created by accessing the
        SPECIAL option within the REPORT command.  A few of  these  reports
        have  been  described in the Version 2-0 document, but they are all
        listed here for the sake of completeness and convenience.

            1) The NODE List.  This report is similar in format to the  old
               Editor file maintained by Project Implementation and then by
               Network Engineering.  It lists all  nodes,  in  node  number
               order,  including  location  (company,  city and state), old
               node number for upgrades, number  of  the  order  that  last
               affected  the node, effective date, and all hosts associated
               with the node, including kernel host.

            2) The HOST list.  This report is in the format  of  the  brief
               host  report.   It  is  separated into two sections, one for
               normal hosts (recognized by  the  Supervisor)  and  one  for
               accounting hosts (5-digit host numbers).

            3) TYMNET-I Nodes.  A report of the remaining T-I nodes in  the
               public  network,  including hardware type, software type and
               location.

            4) The ISIS Report.  This report summarizes  all  of  the  ISIS
               nodes  in  the  network  by  location.   It  shows the hosts
               assigned to each  node,  including  pending  hosts.   It  is
               possible  to  use  this  report to approximate the number of
               ISIS slots available at each site.

            5) The ISIS Report - Tymnet Sites.   Same  as  above  but  only
               listing Tymnet ISIS sites.

            6) Site Summary - Tymnet/Tymshare Network Sites.  A report that
               gives  a one-line description of each Tymnet and/or Tymshare
               site, with a listing of nodes and hosts at that site.

            7) Site Summary -  All  Network  Sites.   Same  as  above,  but
               including  customer  sites  as  well  as Tymnet and Tymshare
               sites.

ADDENDUM


            8) Site Summary -  All  Sites  in  the  Database,  Network  and
               Non-network.   Same  as  above,  but  including sites in the
               database where no nodes or hosts are located.  These  latter
               sites  are  in  the  database to provide complete congruence
               with Tymshare Fixed Assets site  listing.   All  three  Site
               Summary reports are sorted geographically.

            9) Site Report - Network and  Non-network  Sites.   This  is  a
               listing  of  all sites in the database by site id, including
               all the Fixed Assets sites.

            10) Circuit Dump - This is a file, with no report headings,  of
               basic circuit information.  It is intended to be loaded into
               1022 or some other database structure.




                              OTHER NEW FEATURES



        There are several new features incorporated in Release 3-0 that are
        not  apparent  to  the general user.  They are, however, of general
        interest, and for that reason are briefly documented here.

             * AUTOMATIC NODE AND HOST  NUMBER  ASSIGNMENT  -  The  Network
               Profile  is  the  official vehicle for assigning and keeping
               track of node and host numbers.  The  database  software  is
               now  able  to  assign the next valid number to a user who is
               allowed to add a node or host record.  It will automatically
               reassign  numbers  that  have  been deleted for more than 60
               days, in the interests of  keeping  the  Supervisor's  fixed
               node and host number tables to a minimum.

             * TABLE OF VALID CITIES - The program now checks  a  table  of
               cities  whenever  a site is entered or changed.  If the user
               is entering a city not already  in  the  table,  a  list  of
               cities  in  that  country  or state that start with the same
               letter is produced.  This gives the user an  opportunity  to
               verify that the city being entered is not a variant spelling
               of an existing city in the database.

             * BASIC STATISTICS PACKAGE - This gives a brief report on such
               items  as  number  of  nodes and sites in the network.  This
               feature will be greatly enhanced in future releases.

             * TABLE UPDATE PROGRAM - There is now a graceful way  for  the
               Database  Administration  group  to  update  tables of valid
               values, such as hardware and software types.

             * CANADIAN PROVINCES -  Two-character  abbreviations  for  the
               Canadian   provinces  have  now  been  added  to  the  state
               abbreviation  tables.   The  following  is  a  list  of  the
Network Profile Database                                            Page 63
ADDENDUM


               provinces and their corresponding abbreviations:

                    AB Alberta
                    BC British Columbia
                    MB Manitoba
                    NB New Brunswick
                    NF Newfoundland
                    NS Nova Scotia
                    ON Ontario
                    PE Prince Edward Island
                    PQ Quebec
                    SK Saskachewan

             * LARGE REPORT GENERATION IN NETDB - Many of the reports  that
               can  be  produced from the database are large, both in terms
               of paper pages and in terms  of  disk  storage.   They  also
               require  significant  amounts  of  time  and CPU capacity to
               produce.  In order to reduce system degradation during prime
               time,  to  minimize  disk  usage,  and  to  free  up  users'
               terminals, a new scheme  is  being  used  to  produce  large
               reports.

               The large reports include most of the  SPECIAL  reports  and
               the  BRIEF  and  DETAILED  reports that are produced for the
               entire public network.  These  reports  will  be  maintained
               within  the  NETDB  directory.  When the user chooses one of
               them the program will respond with  a  message  stating  the
               last  time  it  was created.  The user then has an option of
               creating a more up-to-date copy (with  the  attendant  delay
               and  CPU  usage),  or  immediately  exiting  and  typing  or
               SPOOLING the copy that  is  already  on-line  in  the  NETDB
               directory.
