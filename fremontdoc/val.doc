          SECTION 1.0 OVERVIEW          ____________________

          VAL runs in a TYMNET Engine ISIS job slot and allows users to update
          the Controlling User Directory (CUD) on disk.  VAL also has instruc-
          tions to back up the CUD to  magnetic tape and  to  restore the  CUD
          from tape.  If there is more than one supervisor in a network, there
          will be  copies of  the CUD  on   all  supervisor   systems.   These
          copies  are  called  Master User  Directories, or MUDs.  In addition
          to  the instructions  described below,  if  there are  MUDs  to   be
          updated,  VAL records  all   changes  made  to  the  CUD   to a spe-
          cial disk area.

          VAL also provides an optional facility for users to change their own
          passwords.


          SECTION 1.1 Login          _________________

          VAL runs in an ISIS job slot and  may be accessed by either a privi-
          leged or  unprivileged username.   To log into  VAL the  user should
          enter:

                                   NETVAL;password

                                        or

                                   NETPRIV;password

          NETVAL is  the unprivileged username  and NETPRIV is  the privileged
          username.

          When a user  is successfully logged into VAL,  the following message
          will be output:

                    ISIS Network Validation System Version 3.03

          Only one  user at a time  may be running  in VAL.  If a  second user
          tries to log in, the following message will be output:

                    VAL ALREADY RUNNING

          and the circuit will be zapped.

          SECTION 1.2 CUD Entries          _______________________

          Optional CUD entries will  be included unless VAL  has been specifi-
          cally set to ignore options.  The  Home System and Class Information
          options  are mutually  exclusive and  the choice  between these  two
          options must be made at system  generation time.  The account repre-
          sentative must be  contacted to have any of the  options changed.  A
          CUD entry may consist of:

          1. USERNAME
             A username may be up  to 20 alphanumeric characters.  Semicolons,
             colons, and all control characters  are not acceptable characters
             for usernames.

          2. PASSWORD CIPHER
             The password cipher  is  computed  from  a  password   of  up  to
             30  characters.  Any  ASCII  character  other than  a  semicolon,
             Escape, or carriage return may be  used within a password.  Pass-
             words are not  echoed to the terminal, and are  entered twice for
             verification.

          3. PASSWORD CHANGE DATE
             The change date is the date that the password was last changed.

          4. GLOBAL ACCOUNT NUMBER (GAN) - OPTIONAL
             The GAN is  an octal number between 0 and   37777777777  and  may
             be used to group users together.

          5. UNIVERSAL USER NUMBER (UUN)
             The  UUN is  an octal  number between  0 and  37777777777 and  is
             unique for each user.

          6. CONTROL INFORMATION:

             IGNORE COLON OPTION (OPTIONAL)
             If the ignore colon option is set,  the user may  only  log  into
             his home system.

             LOGIN OVER SHUT (OPTIONAL)
             Login over shut allows users to access  a  host  even  if  it  is
             shut.

             NO PASSWORD (OPTIONAL)
             If the no password option is  set,  users  are  not  required  to
             input  a  password   when they login and the user  may only login
             to his home system.  (This command implies ignore colon option.)

             TRANSPARENT GATEWAY LOGON (OPTIONAL)
             If the  transparent gateway logon option  is set, the  user logon
             will take him through a gateway into another network.  (This com-
             mand implies ignore colon option.)

          VAL Users Guide                                   September 26, 1980



          7. DISTRICT (OPTIONAL)
             The  district is  a  decimal number  between 0  and  4095 and  is
             another way to group users together.

          8. IRC (OPTIONAL)
             The International  Record Carrier is  a decimal number  between 0
             and 127.   IRC tables must  be present  for any value  other than
             zero to be significant.  The  IRC tables designate unique numbers
             that have been  assigned to IRC links  and this CUD entry  may be
             used to limit  a user's circuit building to links  of a specified
             IRC.

          THE NEXT TWO OPTIONS ARE MUTUALLY  EXCLUSIVE AND ARE CHOSEN WHEN VAL
          IS INSTALLED IN THE NETWORK.  THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLASS INFORMATION
          WILL ONLY WORK IF THAT OPTION WAS CHOSEN.

          9. HOME SYSTEM (OPTIONAL)
             The CUD  must include either  class definitions or  home systems.
             Home systems entries in the CUD do not restrict user access.

          10. CLASS INFORMATION (OPTIONAL)

             The class  information option may be  used to establish  a closed
             user group within the network.  A  closed user group is a segment
             of the total  user population having more  restrictions placed on
             their activities within the network than those put on the general
             category of users.

             CLASS
             The class  for a user  represents the  set of node  numbers  from
             which  the  user may access the  network.  Each class is followed
             by up to six groups or hosts  describing which hosts the user may
             access.  Each class must have either a  home host or a home group
             defined.  Class 0 is the universal class.

             GROUP
             A group represents a set of host numbers.  Group 0 is the univer-
             sal group.

             HOST
             A host is a host number in the network.

          SECTION 1.3 Format and Syntax          _____________________________



          1.3.1 Format                ______

          Val issues an asterisk, "*", to prompt the user to enter an instruc-
          tion.  After  an instruction has been  entered, VAL may  then prompt
          the user for  parameters.  The prompts may be  questions or requests
          and all require some form of response.

          A '?' response to any yes/no question  or prompt for a numeric value
          will  cause the   program  to   return  to   the  instruction   dis-
          patcher.  The  Control-A character  may be used  to delete  the last
          character typed when entering information.

          On two word instructions, such as CHANGE or TYPE, if the second word
          is not   entered,  VAL   will  output  the   options  to   the user.
          For example, if the user types NEW <CR>, VAL will output:

                    USER, OR CLASS:

          The user only needs to input 'USER'  or  'CLASS'  to  continue exec-
          ution of this instruction.

          On instructions  that change the  CUD, after  all   the  information
          is entered, the program prompts:

                    ALL ENTRIES CORRECT?

          If all the entered  information is as it should be,  the user should
          answer 'Y' and the instruction will be carried out.

                    ENTRY COMPLETED

          will then print  to the user when the operation  has been  completed
          sucessfully.   If some  entered information is in  error, answer 'N'
          and the program  will  return  to  the   instruction  dispatcher  to
          allow  the user to reenter the instruction.


          1.3.2 Syntax                ______

          The following  notation is used  in the instruction  descriptions to
          describe the syntax of the instructions:

          uppercase           Letters  or words  are entered  exactly as  they
                              appear in the syntax description.

          lowercase           Letters are optional entries as  VAL will recog-
                              nize instructions abbreviated  to their shortest
                              unique  length.   For  example,   CHEck  may  be
                              entered as  CHE, CHAnge may  be entered  as CHA,
                              and PASSword may be entered as PASS.


                                                            OVERVIEW    Page 4

          SECTION 2.0 INSTRUCTIONS          ________________________

          Instructions to VAL  are divided into  two logical  groups, unprivi-
          leged  and privileged.   A  NETPRIV user  may  enter  any valid  VAL
          instruction.  NETVAL users  may only  execute unprivileged  instruc-
          tions.  The instructions  enable the user to add,  change, or delete
          CUD entries.  NETPRIV instructions have  additional inquiry and com-
          pare capabilities on the CUD entries and read and write capabilities
          on the MUD blocks.   Instructions in each section  are listed alpha-
          betically.  Each instruction description is  followed by an example.
          Instructions exclusively related to the Class Information option are
          so noted.

          Note:  The examples of entries and responses  will be shown with the
                 user input in lower case and  VAL prompts in uppercase.  Com-
                 ments (not  entries or prompts)  are in parentheses.   If you
                 receive responses  that are  not like the  ones shown  in the
                 examples, check Appendix A to  determine whether they are VAL
                 error messages.  If the response is still unique you may have
                 a system error.



          SECTION 2.1 NETVAL (Unprivileged) Instructions          ______________________________________________



          2.1.1 Attach Instruction                __________________

          Syntax:  Attach

          Description:  The attach instruction assigns a magnetic tape unit to
               the user's  slot.   This   must  be   done  before   any  other
               tape instructions  can be  executed.  The  user must  enter the
               tape unit number.

               Example:

                  * attach

                  TAPE UNIT: 1

                  TAPE ATTACHED

                  *

          2.1.2 Change Class Instruction                ________________________

          Syntax:  CHAnge CLass

          Description:  The change class instruction changes the definition of
               a class already  assigned  to  a user.  The user must enter the
               username, class position, and class  information (see New Class
               Instruction  subsection 2.1.16).   Class  position  refers   to
               the  relative position of the class the user wants to change in
               the list of classes  for the user.  The first class  for a user
               is position 1, the second is position 2, etc.  The user will be
               requested to redefine the class completely.

          2.1.17 New User Instruction                 ____________________

          Syntax:  New User

          Description:  The new user instruction enters  a brand new name into
               the  CUD.  The  user must  first  decide whether  the new  name
               should be validated in a  global account that  already  exists,
               or   if  the   name   should  be  validated   in  a new  global
               account.   If the  name is  to be  validated in  an old  global
               account,  the user  will be  prompted  for a   user  name  that
               already  exists   in  that  account.    The  user will  then be
               prompted for  username, control  information, password  (twice,
               not  echoed), district,  IRC,  and  class or  home  information
               (depending on which VAL option was chosen).

               The new name is  assigned  the   next  sequential  UUN  availa-
               ble.  UUN's  are  not reused, even  after a username is invali-
               dated.  If the new name is  validated in an old global account,
               it  will   be  assigned  the  same   GAN  as   the  name   that
               already  exists  in that account.   Otherwise, the next sequen-
               tial GAN will be assigned to the user.

          2.2.7 Read MUD Instruction                ____________________

          Syntax:  REAd Mud

          Description:  The read  MUD instruction allows the user  to read any
               block of a  MUD.   The  operator  must  input  the block number
               and the sup number.  VAL will build  a circuit through the net-
               work if necessary  and retrieve the information  desired by the
               operator.

                   Example:

                   * read mud

                   BLOCK NUMBER:  1668

                   ENTER SUP NUMBER:  123

                   BLOCK READ

                   *


          2.2.8 Type MUD Instruction                ____________________

          Syntax:  TYPE MUD

          Description:  The type MUD instruction types  out the MUD block just
               read by  the read MUD instruction.   The output is the  same as
               for type CUD.




          2.2.9 Write Instruction                _________________

          Syntax:  WRITE

          Description:  The write instruction is  used ***VERY carefully*** to
               overwrite MUD blocks with CUD information.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS
               COMMAND.

               Example:

               *WRITE

               ENTER SUP NUMBER:  124

               BLOCK WRITTEN

               *

          2.2.10 MUD Consistency Command                 _______________________


          Syntax:  CONsistency

          Description:  This command used to cause  the MUD on a Supervisor to
               become identical with the CUD.

               Note:  This  command  requires considerable  time  to  complete
                      (sometimes 15 minutes or more).  The only way to stop it
                      once it  has begun is  to forcibly disconnect  from VAL.
                      It should be noted that the MUD will have been partially
                      updated at  that point.  As  the computer  processes the
                      blocks of information, a dot is  displayed on the termi-
                      nal after every  32 blocks of  the total 2040  are proc-
                      essed.

               Example:

               * CONSISTENCY

               ENTER SUP NO: 123

               .......................................................

               MUD CONSISTENCY COMPLETE

               *

               Note:  An optional terminal  message which may be  given to the
                      user in addition to MUD CONSISTENCY COMPLETE is

                      THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES ENCOUNTERED.

          SECTION 3.0 USER PASSWORD CHANGING          __________________________________

          VAL may be  configured to permit any  user with the colon  option to
          change his own password.  To log into VAL for this purpose, the user
          should enter his username  followed by a colon and  the change pass-
          word host number (a  configuration parameter), and a  semicolon fol-
          lowed by password.

               Example:
                                 marcinjill:83;password

          VAL will then inquire if the user  wishes to change his password and
          if so will request the password twice.  When the change is complete,
          the user will be logged off.

               Example:

               DO YOU WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD? y

               PASSWORD:
               ENTER IT AGAIN:

               CHANGE COMPLETE
               PLEASE LOG IN:

          SECTION 4.0 FRONT PANEL DISPLAY          _______________________________

          While VAL is running, the Engine Front  Panel display may be used to
          display the  CUD block  number currently  in use.   This display  is
          selected by unlocking the Engine Front Panel, entering the slot num-
          ber in which  VAL is running and  then depressing the RUN  key.  The
          rightmost four digits are the current  CUD block number in hexadeci-
          mal.  This display is useful to monitor the progress of the consist-
          ency operation.  (CUD block numbers are between 0 and 7F8.)

          SECTION 5.0 INITIALIZING THE CUD          ________________________________

          When a  network is initially brought  up, there are no  usernames in
          the CUD.  Thus, it  is not possible to use the network  to log in to
          VAL and  validate usernames.   It is, however,  possible to  use the
          ISIS console TTY port to log in to an ISIS slot.  The following pro-
          cedure should be  used to initialize the CUD and  validate the first
          username.

               Connect a terminal  to the console TTY  port and log in  to the
               slot in which VAL is loaded.

               Example:

                  LOGON: mike
                  NODE:  2001
                  HOST:  121

                  SLOT #: 5
                  *

               Enter the  ?STAT command to start  up the procedure  and answer
               "YES" to the question.

               Example:

                  *?STAT

                  ISIS NETWORK VALIDATION SYSTEM VERSION 3.03

                  DO YOU WISH TO INITIALIZE THE CUD? y

               After a  few minutes  the program  will print  some message  to
               indicate completion.

               Example:

                  CUD HAS BEEN CLEARED INITIALIZING PJ AREA.
                  INITIALIZATION COMPLETE AND NETPRIV VALIDATED.
                  *

          At this point, the CUD has been cleared and the username NETPRIV has
          been validated.  With the initial password  of PRIVILEGE, it is then
          possible to use the network to log in to VAL to validate other user-
          names.

          To maintain network security, the  password for the NETPRIV username
          should be changed to another value  after CUD initialization is com-
          plete.

          The following error messages are produced by VAL in response to var-
          ious erroneous  entries made  by a user.   Other error  messages may
          appear when running  VAL if there are system problems.   Most of the
          error messages are self-explanatory.  Those that are not self-expla-
          natory will have a brief explanation under the message.  The message
          is shown in uppercase  letters and the messages  are arranged alpha-
          betically.
