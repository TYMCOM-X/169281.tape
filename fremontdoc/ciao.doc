CIAO is used to do I/O either to whatever is at the end of an
auxiliary circuit or to a child frame on the same system.  The
latter case allows command files to be executed without using up
a port on the base or getting the Supervisor involved.

CIAO accepts commands from the command port (hereafter refered to as
TTY) or from a command file.  Input to the created circuit or
child frame (hereafter called PORT) may come from the TTY, the
command file or an input file.  Output from the PORT may go to
the TTY an output file or be trashed.  If CIAO is running detatched, all TTY
output will go to a file xxxCIO.OUT where xxx is the current "job" number.

CIAO may be started from the TTY in monitor command mode or from a
program by executing a RUN UUO.

If started by a RUN UUO with an offset of 1, CIAO expects a
command file on the file xxxCIO.TMP, where xxx is the current "job" number.

If started by user command, a command line may be entered
on the monitor command line following a semicolon.  When the command
ends, control will return to the TTY unless a command file
was ended by a QUIT command.

A command to CIAO consists of a verb, optionally one or more blanks
followed by arguments, and a carriage return.  Within the argument
field a special escape character (user definable with the SET command
(default ^P) and hereafter refered to as ESC) causes the next
character to be interpreted as follows.

	D	Display everything until the next ESC&D to the TTY
		(ESCs will still be recognized within the string)
	F	turn TTY echo ofF
	N	turn TTY echo oN
	I	Input from TTY until a <CR>
	U	represents the current GFDed Username
	S	represents the system number CIAO is running on

all other characters are just passed as if the ESC was not present.
ESC<CR> has a special affect after the INPUT or RESUME commands
have been entered (see below).

COMMANDS (uppercase indicates minimum specification) -

Nest <file-name>	execute commands from <file-name>. A command file
	will be searched for as follows:
	(<GFDed Username>)<file-name>
	(<Logged in Username>)<file-name>
	(<GFDed username>)CIAO.COM
	(<Logged in Username>)CIAO.COM
	(<CIAO's Username>)CIAO.COM
	If a file named CIAO.COM is used then a line of the form
	@<file-name><CR> will be searched for on that file and
	commands will be read starting with the next line.
	A command file is terminated when either 1) an @ starts a line,
	2) a QUIT command is seen, or 3) the end of file is reached.
	When <file-name> ends, the next command in the current
	command file (if any) is read.  Nesting may be up to 10 deep.

Creaux <login-string>	build an auxiliary circuit to the given username
	and system.  If executed from a TTY, a RESUME command is implied
	after the Creaux.  If <login-string> is null then the current
	system and the GFDed Username are implied.

Pty <username>	works like Creaux except that a child frame will be
	created with a Pseudo tTY instead of an aux circuit.  This
	saves a base port and a network supervisor call.
	The child will have the same licenses as the parent frame.
	If no <username> is given the GFDed name is used.

Dial <phoneno>	dial out using <phoneno> as number

Force <string>	outputs <string> on PORT.  A <CR> will follow <string>
	unless it ends with the ascii character <esc>.  In this case
	neither the <cr> or the <esc> is sent.

Wait <n>	wait for n seconds or for event
	n=0	send yellow ball and wait for an orange ball
	n>0	wait for n seconds or until PORT zapped
	n<0	wait for n seconds or until character from PORT or zapped

Time <n>	wait for n seconds of no characters from PORT or
	PORT zapped, n=0 or null implies n=20

Output <file-spec>	declare file for PORT output
	if a file is already open, close and release it.
	If <file-spec> exists, rename it to file.BAK.
	Open <file-spec> in Update mode thus allowing another process
	to read the file while it is being written.  The file
	will be updated at least every UPD seconds (see SET command).
	The COPY flag will be set to true (see SET command).

Input <file-spec>	copies a file to PORT
	if <file-spec> is null, input will start with the next line
	of the command-file.  Input without a <file-spec> entered
	at the TTY is the same as the RESUME command.
	ESC sequences will be processed on the input file.
	ESC<cr> will end input mode and return to commandmode,
	An end-of-file acts as an ESC<cr>.  On a separate input file
	(i.e. <file-spec> not null) everything passed an ESC<cr> is ignored.

	If SENDLF (see SET command) then <lf>s from input will be
	sent to PORT.
	If YELLOWBALL (see SET command) then a yellow ball will be sent
	after each <lf> is seen from input and an orange ball is expected
	from PORT before continuing, else (LINEFEED), a <lf> is expected
	from the PORT before continuing.

Resume	send characters transparently from TTY to PORT
	starts reading from TTY, all characters are passed
	except that the ESC sequences will be processed. ESC<cr> will
	return to command mode (next line of command file if any or TTY).
	In transparent mode all output from PORT is sent to TTY
	regardless of the SEE flag (see SET command).

ZAP	sends zapper on PORT

Hang	sends yellowball followed by hang character on PORT

Unattach <file-name> If <file-name> is null just detach current frame
	else create a detached frame belonging to the GFDed username
	and execute the command file <file-name> in that frame.  The frame
	will have the same licenses that the parent frame had.  The frame
	will be destroyed when the command file completes.

SET <arg1>{ <arg2>...}	sets arguments as follows
	ESCape=<esc-char>	sets ESC to <esc-char> (default ESCape=^P)
			If <esc-char> is <cr>, <lf> or <blank> then ESC will
			not be defined and the circuit will be transparent.
			Lower case a-z are not allowed ESC characters.
	UPD=<sec>	number of seconds of no PORT output before
		flushing OUTPUT file buffers to disk.
		Initially 3600 seconds, i.e. 1 hour.
	COPY/NOCOPY	turns on/off recording of PORT output to
		OUTPUT file, set to COPY automatically by the
		OUTPUT command
	SEE/NOSEE	turns on/off copying of PORT output to TTY
		starts out NOSEE except that during a RESUME command
		it is ignored (always assumed on)
	BLANK/NOBLANK	turns off/on blank line supression from PORT,
		initially BLANK, i.e. no suppression.
	LINEFEED/YELLOWBALL select handshake for INPUT command (see) (def YB)
	LF/YB	same as LINEFEED/YELLOWBALL
	SENDLF/OMITLF	select whether <lf> from input file is sent
		on PORT (see INPUT command) default OMITLF
	CAPTAIN=<string>	set outdial captain username

	Known Bugs --

1.	Child does not have parents licenses on Unatt and Pty.
2.	If a circuit is zapped during RESUME processing (i.e.,
	the TTY is talking over the aux circuit) a [circuit zapped]
	message is typed at the TTY but the user must enter a
	carriage return to return to the command file or the
	CIAO prompt level.
3.	The <ESC>D (display characters at terminal) does not work.


The author of a previous incarnation of this program documented
it as follows.

"This program does not work (unless by chance).  That is,  the
way it does interrupts is guarenteed to break sooner or later.
This program has been maintained from its birth (when it
was called TOUT and only had one feature) until now with the
philosophy that all new features are implemented without any
knowledge of existing features.  This holds down to the routines
used to do the work.  Do not be confused therefore if you find 12
different routines all doing the same thing.  Also, be warned,
it isn't very well indented or structured.  It is NOT supported!
By the way none of the original features of this program still
exist, if that tells you anything about how its written."
