                                 SUMMARY OF CHANGES TO

                                PROBE Reference Manual

                                  September 30, 1983

            This manual (formerly known  as PROBE User's Guide)  dated Sep-
            tember 30,  1983 (Pubs #534)  documents software version  34 of
            PROBE.  It supercedes the PROBE manual  of April 10, 1981 which
            documented software version 27.

            Some of the major changes are:

            1.   Introduction of product identifiers  and product names for
                 various slot codes (Appendix B).

            2.   Node Report log messages are in a new format.

            3.   All references  to TYMNET I  technology  have been  elimi-
                 nated.

            4.   The LIST command has been modified  to list all assembled-
                 in PROBE usernames and  their status.  Previously, certain
                 usernames  were  automatically assembled  into  PROBE  for
                 maintenance purposes.   These have  been removed  to allow
                 independent networks to have complete control over access.

            5.   The crash codes  reported in the TYPE 19  and TYPE 2A Node
                 Reports has been expanded (Appendix C).

            6.   Messages 158, LINE  SHUT, and 178, LINE  UNSHUT now appear
                 as LINK SHUT and LINK UNSHUT, respectively.

            7.   Message 98 reports link speed for the "NEW LINK" and "LINE
                 ATTACHED" conditions.

            8.   The Supervisor code as of version 41 will report ISIS rea-
                 sons for a  restart.  The current  Supervisor  software is
                 version 40.01  (Baseline-I, 10/15/83).   However, we  have
                 included these log messages in  this document in anticipa-
                 tion of version 41 of the  Supervisor code, to be released
                 shortly.   In  the case  of  restarts  due to  an  illegal
                 instruction, illegal SVC, parity error, or protection vio-
                 lation, the Supervisor's program counter is also reported.
                 The Supervisor uses  illegal instructions to  cause inten-
                 tional crashes  when a fatal  condition is  detected.  The
                 most common conditions are noted with  code that is inter-
















                 preted by PROBE.  These messages are all 310 (Chapter 3 of
                 this manual).

            9.   As of version  33 of PROBE, and 40 of  the Supervisor, the
                 DCENT and DCREAD commands allow senior systems programmers
                 from  Tymshare's  Network Technology  Division  temporary,
                 controlled access to an independent network for resolution
                 of a  major network problem.   See Appendix  A, Restricted
                 Commands.

            10.  A new set of performance data is available with the PERDAT
                 command (Chapter  2).  This  is available  with Supervisor
                 version 40 of software.


















































                                        PREFACE


            This manual  describes the  PROBE program,  which runs  on each
            network Supervisor.  PROBE is used to monitor the status of the
            nodes, hosts,  and lines  in a TYMNET  network.  PROBE  is also
            used to alter the status of  network components to maintain the
            quality of  data transmission in  the network.  This  manual is
            intended for  network operators and system  programmers.  There
            are three major chapters and five appendixes.

            The  first chapter  is a  program overview  which explains  the
            functions of  PROBE.  The  chapter includes  startup and  login
            procedures, and the command format and syntax.

            The second chapter  contains the commands,  arranged alphabeti-
            cally within four  subsections according to the  status that is
            required to execute them.  The  commands are intended primarily
            for network operations personnel.

            The third chapter lists  the PROBE log messages.   The log mes-
            sages are listed in alphabetical order, with the message number
            and a description.  The log messages are also listed by message
            number.

            This manual also contains five appendixes, Restricted Commands,
            Product Names, Crash Codes, System Messages, and Command Table.

            PROBE Reference Manual                       September 30, 1983


                                      CHAPTER ONE


            OVERVIEW            ________

            PROBE is  a program that  runs on  each Supervisor in  a TYMNET
            network.  It is used to output the information contained in the
            Supervisor Error Log, which contains  status messages about the
            nodes, hosts, and lines  in the network.  It is  used to inter-
            vene manually at any point in the network to bring up new nodes
            or links,  or to restrict  the use of  nodes or links  that are
            affecting  the quality  of data  transmission  in the  network.
            PROBE is  also used  to control  the operation  of the  network
            Supervisors.

            While a network may contain as  many as seven Supervisors, only
            one Supervisor is active (awake) and  in control of the network
            at any given  time.  PROBE on the active Supervisor  is used to
            monitor or alter  the current status of the  network.  PROBE on
            an inactive (sleeping  or frozen) Supervisor is  used to obtain
            log information generated while a  Supervisor was awake.  PROBE
            on an  inactive Supervisor is used  to determine the  status of
            the network when that Supervisor went to sleep.


            Startup            _______

            When the Supervisor is  first initialized, it obtains  the cur-
            rent Greenwich  Mean Time (GMT) from  the super clock.   If the
            super clock has failed, the Supervisor prompts the PROBE opera-
            tor for  GMT in  the form YYYY:DDD:HH:MM,  where "YYYY"  is the
            current year, "DDD" is the day of the year, "HH" is the current
            hour, and "MM" is the current minute.  An escape or a control-Q
            causes PROBE to skip to the login sequence.

                                         NOTE                                         ____

            The  PROBE operator  must use  extreme care  when entering  the
            time.  Erroneous entries may  cause a significant loss  of net-
            work accounting data.

            Login            _____

            All network  Supervisors are assigned  a host system  number in
            the range 121 through 127.  The host  number used is the Super-
            visor number + 120.  The following are valid methods of logging
            into PROBE:

                 PROBE:127;password;<CR>
                 PROBE:*;password<CR>

            The asterisk specifies the  currently active Supervisor.  PROBE
            then prompts  for the PROBE  username.  When that  username has
            been entered, PROBE prompts for the password.  Typing an escape
            a or control-Q during login returns  to the time prompt for the
            username.  Note that  there is a timeout for  completion of the
            login.  An example of the PROBE login sequence is:

                 NAME:user1<CR>
                 PASSWORD:password<CR>

            Usernames may be assembled into  PROBE at system generation, or
            they may be disk resident.  Usernames  assembled at system gen-
            eration are  harder to modify, but  they enable an  operator to
            log into PROBE  even if the disk is inoperative.   If there are
            more than 15 PROBE user slots,  the last three slots are always
            reserved for users with assembled usernames.

            Because PROBE is  so powerful, the PROBE  commands are assigned
            one of five status  levels.  These status levels  are:  no sta-
            tus, status 20, status 10, status 01, and status 02.  An opera-
            tor is assigned a status code when he is first validated to use
            PROBE.  It  enables him to use  the commands that  are assigned
            specific status  levels.  These command  status levels  are not
            hierarchical; PROBE  operators must  be authorized  to use  the
            commands in each group.

            PROBE also has  a status level 04, which is  a timeout override
            status, rather  than a command  status level.  PROBE  users are
            typically subject to a connect time limit, which is set at sys-
            tem generation.  An  operator with status 04 is  not subject to
            the time limit.

            Format and Syntax            _________________

            The following notations are used in this manual to describe the
            command syntax.

            UPPERCASE CHARACTERS   show the minimum segment  of the command
                                   or parameter required to define the com-
                                   mand or parameter.

            lowercase characters   show variable or optional entries.

                             [ ]   enclose  an  optional item  or  list  of
                                   items, one  of which may be  chosen.  If
                                   none  is  entered, a  default  value  is
                                   used.  The brackets are not entered.

                               |   represents   an  "or"   choice   between
                                   optional   parameters.   It   is   never
                                   entered as a command.

            All commands  are typed  on one  line and  end with  a carriage
            return.  They must be left justified, immediately following the
            command prompt (a colon).  The  command format is typically one
            of the following:

                 c
                 c p
                 c v
                 c pv
                 c v v

            where "c" is the command word, "p" is the parameter, and "v" is
            a  value.  A  space between  the  command and  a parameter,  or
            between the command  and a value, is  mandatory.  Typically, no
            space is enteredeen a parameter  and a related value; how-
            ever, a space is entered between two related values (two nodes,
            for example).

            PROBE responds  to a syntax error  with a question mark.   If a
            command  is  issued  to  a Supervisor  that  is  sleeping,  the
            response "SLEEPING"  is displayed after  each command  has been
            entered.  If a command is issued to  a  Supervisor that is fro-
            zen, the response "SUP FROZEN" is displayed  after each command
            has been  entered.  An operator  may still inspect  the network
            status up until the time the Supervisor froze or went to sleep.

            Special Characters            __________________

            PROBE recognizes  three special characters,  escape, control-Q,
            and control-A.

            Escape or control-Q deletes an entire  line of command text and
            returns to the command prompt.   It also terminates any current
            PROBE output and returns to the command prompt.

            Control-A deletes the previous character(s).  The logical input
            line pointer  will back up one  position, although this  is not
            displayed at the terminal.

                                      CHAPTER TWO


            COMMANDS            ________

            This section describes the PROBE commands used by network oper-
            ators.  Commands  requiring no  status are  informational; they
            are  used to  inquire  about the  status  of  the network  (see
            below).  Status 20 and status 10 commands are intended for net-
            work operators.  They are used to  alter the state of nodes and
            links in the network (see pages 31 and 37).  Status 01 commands
            are intended for  lead network operators or  the equivalent, in
            an independent  network environment.   These commands  are very
            powerful; they are used to alter  the state of network Supervi-
            sors (see page 41).  Status 02 commands,  used by network main-
            tenance personnel  and system  programmers for  maintenance and
            debugging, are in APPENDIX A.


            Commands Requiring No Status            ____________________________

            This section describes the commands requiring no status.  These
            commands are used almost exclusively for inquiry.


            Account Status Command            ______________________

            Syntax:  ACCT

            This command displays  the number of free  accounting blocks in
            the accounting file.  Each block contains 1024 bytes.

            Example:

                 :acct
                 ACCOUNTING BLOCKS LEFT 2225
                 :


            All Nodes Command            _________________

            Syntax:  AN

            This command displays,  for all nodes in the  network, the node
            number, node code version number, node type, host numbers (H#),
            crash count  (C#), and  upstream node  number.  The  Supervisor
            node lists 0 as its upstream node.  All other nodes in the net-



                                                         COMMANDS    Page 5









            PROBE Reference Manual                       September 30, 1983


            work list the  Supervisor node as their upstream  node.  In the
            output, the host number and crash count are preceded by "H" and
            "C" respectively.

            Example:

                 :an
                 2006 404 9 H126 C7   0
                 2010 404 9 H458 C2   2006
                 :


            All Up Command            ______________

            Syntax: AU

            This command lists all nodes currently under the control of the
            Supervisor.  It is  similar to the AN command  except that only
            node numbers are listed.

            Example:

                 :au
                 2001
                 2002
                 2006
                 2010
                 2011
                 2012
                 :


            Additional Status Command            _________________________

            Syntax:  ASTAT

            This command lists  the number of normal  and auxiliary circuit
            login timeouts.  The first line of  the output shows the number
            of normal circuit  login timeouts (using a  2 minute timer) and
            auxiliary  circuit login  timeouts  (using  a 20 second  timer)
            respectively.   The second  line shows  the  maximum number  of
            rebuild requests  made since  the Supervisor  awoke, i.e.,  the
            peak size  of the queue.   The third  line shows the  number of
            rebuild requests  that were not satisfied  for lack of  a path,
            and the two node  numbers at the ends of the  last circuit that
            was not rebuilt for lack of a  path.  The fourth line shows the
            number of circuits not rebuilt because an end node was unavail-



                                                         COMMANDS    Page 6









            PROBE Reference Manual                       September 30, 1983


            able.  The fifth line shows the number of rebuild requests that
            overflowed the queue.

            Example:

                 :astat
                 LOGIN TIMEOUTS 103 2
                 MAX REBUILD 53
                 NO PATH FOR REBUILD 5 2005 2103
                 NO REBUILD BECAUSE NODE NOT TAKEN OVER 4
                 REBUILDS REFUSED DUE TO OVERFLOW 0
                 :


            Channel Command            _______________

            Syntax:  CHAN node#

            This command lists  the command port  number (in  decimal) cur-
            rently used  by the Supervisor for  the command circuit  to the
            specified node.  This command is used with the TRACE command to
            trace control circuits.

            Example:

                 :chan 2020
                 18
                 :


            Change Command            ______________

            Syntax:  CHANGE

            This command  is used to change  your PROBE password.   The new
            password becomes effective immediately, but it is not copied to
            PROBE on  other systems.   If the  PROBE password  cipher of  a
            username that has been assembled  at system generation is being
            changed, the PROBE Tymfile must be  updated, and the PROBE code
            must be reassembled and reloaded.

            When the CHANGE command is entered, PROBE prompts the user once
            for the old  password and twice for the new  password.  It does
            not  echo the  passwords.  When  PROBE returns  to the  command
            prompt, the new cipher is in effect for that system.





                                                         COMMANDS    Page 7









            PROBE Reference Manual                       September 30, 1983


            Example:

                 :change
                 OLD PASSWORD:
                 PASSWORD:
                 TYPE AGAIN:
                 :


            Continuous Status Command            _________________________

            Syntax:  CSTAT

            This command displays the time, the  login rate, and the number
            of nodes in each takeover state.   It generates the same output
            as the TIME  command, the LRATE command, and  the STAT command.
            The  output is  displayed every  15 seconds  until an  operator
            enters a control-Q or an escape.

            Example:

                 :cstat
                 238:08:32:47
                 60
                 0 0 0 0 0 0 256
                 DF 0 REJECTS 2 1033 22
                 :


            Cost Command            ____________

            Syntax:  COST node#

            This command shows the cost (in decimal) of the command circuit
            for the specified  node at the time the circuit  was built.  If
            no node  is specified,  the command  shows the  command circuit
            cost for each node.

            Example:

                 :cost 2403
                 2403 13
                 :

            PROBE Reference Manual                       September 30, 1983


            Exceptions Command            __________________

            Syntax:  EXC [O|S|P]

            This command displays information regarding  links that are out
            (O), shut (S), or out of passthroughs (P).  Only one option may
            be specified at a time.  The output  includes the end node num-
            bers, the  link number between  them, and the  exception state.
            If no option  is chosen, output for all options  except "P" are
            listed.  If  the "P" option  is specified, the  output includes
            the node number and the exception.   The "S" option lists links
            that  are currently  shut in  the network.   The out  condition
            exists only for a 20 second period when a link first comes up.

            The LSHUT  command displays  the links that  have been  shut by
            PROBE operators using the ESHUT command.   This output may dif-
            fer from the output generated by the "S" option of the EXC com-
            mand if some of the nodes displayed using the LSHUT command are
            not currently in the network.

            Examples:

                 :exc
                 2017 2 2110 SHUT
                 2021 3 2076 OUT
                 2012 2 2141 OUT SHUT
                 2110 4 2017 SHUT
                 2141 8 2012 OUT SHUT
                 :
                 :Exc p
                 2017  OUT OF PASSTHROUGHS
                 2021  OUT OF PASSTHROUGHS
                 :


            Exit Command            ____________

            Syntax:  EXI

            This command logs an operator out of PROBE.

            Example:

                 :exi
                 PLEASE LOG IN:

            Help Command            ____________

            Syntax:  [HELP|H|?]

            HELP refers an operator to this document.

            Example:

                 :help
                 PLEASE CONSULT THE PROBE DOCUMENT.
                 :


            Host Command            ____________

            Syntax:  HOST [host#]

            This command displays information regarding the specified host,
            including the host  number, its status, the  position number of
            the host on its base, the base  node number, the host cost, the
            host IQ, and the product name.  If no host number is specified,
            information for all hosts is displayed.

            The host status may be DOWN,  SHUT, NO PORTS, or ANSWERED.  The
            host cost is used for load leveling  for a multiple target des-
            tination.

            The position number of the host on its base is always zero.  It
            is  included to  maintain backward  compatibility with  earlier
            versions of code.

            The host  IQ is an indication  of whether the host  supports an
            Interface  Information  Exchange protocol  (IIX)  that  enables
            interfaces at the ends of a virtual circuit to negotiate inter-
            nal protocols during the circuit  building process.  It enables
            two interfaces, which may or may  not be different, to communi-
            cate with  each other  using a  common internal  protocol.  The
            designation  IIX-Y or  IIX-N  indicates  whether the  interface
            accepts  negotiations.  If  a call  request  to the  Supervisor
            indicates a request to negotiate  and the destination interface
            can negotiate, the  Supervisor informs both interfaces  at call
            origination that  they may  negotiate.  If  the caller  has not
            requested negotiation, if  the destination host  cannot negoti-
            ate, or  both, the Supervisor does  not indicate a  request for
            negotiation during circuit  building.  In this case  the inter-
            faces exchange only user data.

            The product name indicates the interface running in the Engine.
            Not all interfaces report a product name at this time; in these
            cases, the field is blank.  For  a complete list of the product
            names, see Appendix B.

                 Example:

                 :host 900

                 :


            Last Accounting Block Command            _____________________________

            Syntax:  LACCT

            This command displays  the number of the  last accounting block
            collected  (in  decimal).   The  value is  used  with  the  Raw
            Accounting Merger (RAM)  program.  The value is  updated by the
            ACCOUNT slave each time 16 blocks have been collected.  A block
            is 1024 bytes.

            Example:

                 :lacct
                 LAST ACCOUNTING BLOCK COLLECTED 247
                 :


            Last Minute Command            ___________________

            Syntax:  LSTMIN

            LSTMIN  outputs circuit  status  information  generated by  the
            Supervisor during the  preceding 1 minute interval, as  well as
            certain running totals.  The first line shows the login rate as
            it is listed in the PROBE log.  The second line shows the Aver-
            age Length  of a  User's (ALU) virtual  circuit, its  cost, the
            longest user's  circuit, and  its cost as  listed in  the PROBE
            log.  The third line shows the node  pair involved in the long-
            est circuit.  The  fourth line shows the node  pair involved in
            the  highest cost  circuit.  The  fifth line  shows, since  the
            Supervisor last awoke,  the number of logins,  the average ALU,
            the average circuit cost, and  the number of internal circuits.
            If the Supervisor is sleeping when  this command is issued, the
            output indicates  the status  of the  network when  it went  to
            sleep.  If the Supervisor is frozen or  if it was awakened dur-
            ing the last minute, the output may not be meaningful.

            List Shut Links Command            _______________________

            Syntax:  LSHUT

            LSHUT lists the two  nodes on the ends of each  shut link.  The
            list is  maintained on disk,  and because the  Supervisor reads
            the list  only once  per minute,  the list  may not  accurately
            indicate the links  actually shut by the  Supervisor.  The list
            may also be inaccurate because a link is temporarily out of the
            network.  The  "S" option of the  EXC command lists  shut links
            currently in the network.

            Example:

                 :lshut
                 2040 2037
                 2204 2114
                 2020 2032

            Log Command            ___________

            Syntax: LOG [time|[A|C|D|E|F|G|H|M|S|X]time|[B|L]nn]

            This command displays network information from the Supervisor's
            log.  The options  define the  type of  information to  be dis-
            played, and/or  the time in  the past  from which output  is to
            begin.  If no output restriction or  time is specified, all log
            messages are  output, starting with  the current  time.  Output
            continues until  an operator enters  a control-Q or  an escape.
            The message CAUGHT UP is output when the current pointer in the
            log is reached,  indicating that  subsequent messages  are cur-
            rent.

            The options are:

            time = Specifies the  time in the  past from which  output from
                   the log  is to begin.  It  may be specified as  a number
                   "nnn", indicating the number of minutes before the pres-
                   ent  time.  It  may  also be  specified  using the  form
                   "ddd:hh:mm", indicating  the Julian date, the  hour, and
                   the minute  (GMT)  from  which the  output is  to begin.
                   For example, the value 244:18:45 is 6:45 p.m. on Septem-
                   ber 1st.

               A = Restricts  messages to performance data, login rate, and
                   circuit length messages, starting at the specified time.
                   These include message numbers 198, 250, 2D0, and 300.

               B = Outputs log  entries from  the Supervisor  log, starting
                   "nn" blocks  before the  current pointer  position.  One
                   block contains 64 log entries.

               C = Restricts messages to those selected using the RLOG com-
                   mand, starting at the specified time.

               D = Suppresses the output  of node reports, starting  at the
                   specified time.

               E = Outputs messages  generated by the nodes  selected using
                   the RNODE command, starting at the specified time.

               F = Restricts the output  of node reports to  those selected
                   using  the REPORT  command,  starting  at the  specified
                   time.  The  "F" option does  not restrict the  output of
                   other log messages.  It is best used in conjunction with
                   the "C" option to restrict the output of log messages to
                   specific node reports.

               G = Restricts messages to login  error messages, starting at
                   the specified time.  These  include message numbers 280,
                   2B0, 2B8, and 2C0.

               H = Outputs  log messages  in hexadecimal,  starting at  the
                   specified time.  This is the  actual log message without
                   PROBE interpretation.   This option  is of  use only  to
                   system programmers.   The Supervisor number is  added to
                   the message  number in the  output.  For example,  if an
                   operator is logged into PROBE on Supervisor 2, the nota-
                   tion "CA" at the beginning of the message indicates that
                   the message number is "C8".

               L = Outputs  log entries,  starting  with  "nn" log  entries
                   before the current entry.

               M = Outputs all attempted access violations, starting at the
                   specified time.

               S = Outputs log  messages with the  time the  reported event
                   occurred, starting  at the  specified time.   Otherwise,
                   the time is printed once per minute.

               X = Restricts messages  to link  and host  related messages,
                   starting at the specified time.

            The various options may be combined  in a single command.  Note
            the following restrictions:

            The "H" option overrides all message selection options.
            The "B" option overrides the "L" option.
            The "X" option overrides the "D" and "C" options.
            The "M" option overrides the "X", "D", and "C" options.

            Login Rate Command            __________________

            Syntax:  LRATE

            This command lists the ongoing  Supervisor login rate in logins
            per minute.  The output shows the  starting time and the number
            of logins per minute, at 1 minute  intervals.  The time is dis-
            played again every 10 minutes.  Output continues until an oper-
            ator enters a control-Q or an escape.

            Example:

            Node Command            ____________

            Syntax:  Node node#

            The  NODE command  displays  status  information regarding  the
            specified node.  The numbers in parentheses in this description
            reference the numbers in parentheses  in the example.  They are
            not part of the output.

            Line (1) of  the response shows the version number  of the node
            code, the node  type (which is always 9), the  crash count, and
            the upstream node (which is always the Supervisor node).

            Line (2) of  the response shows  the number of  available pass-
            throughs.

            Lines (3 - 7) of the response show  the hosts on the node.  For
            each host, the response includes the host number, the host sta-
            tus, the host cost, the host IQ, and the product name.

            PROBE Reference Manual                       September 30, 1983


            Host status may be ANSWERED, SHUT, DOWN, or NO PORTS.  The mes-
            sage "OUT OF PASSTHROUGHS" follows the  host status if the node
            is out of passthroughs.

            The host cost  is used for load leveling for  a multi-target or
            multi-base  host destination.   The  host  IQ is  an  Interface
            Information Exchange protocol (IIX)  that enables interfaces at
            the ends of  a virtual circuit to  negotiate internal protocols
            during  the circuit  building process,  where  IIX-Y and  IIX-N
            indicates whether or not the interface accepts negotiations.

            The product name  is a parameter that the  interface may report
            to the Supervisor to indicate the  product running on the host.
            Not all interfaces report their product name to the Supervisor;
            the field is left blank if this is the case.  For a list of the
            product names, see Appendix B.

            Lines (8 - 11) of the response shows  the status of all network
            links to the node.  The neighbor  number and the link speed are
            listed for each communication link.  The link speed is either a
            value in Kilobits  per second, or the  notation "MS" indicating
            an optically coupled link.

            Exception conditions are listed for links that are out, shut or
            frozen.  The notation OUT typically indicates that the link has
            just come  up and it  is being tested  for a brief  time period
            before being made available for circuit building.  The notation
            SHUT indicates that  a network operator has  restricted circuit
            building on  that link using  the ESHUT command.   The notation
            FROZEN indicates  that the link has  been detached, but  it has
            not yet been declared down.

            Syntax:  OV [L]

            This command displays  the number of links  that are overloaded
            in one or both directions.  The  "L" option generates a list of
            the overloaded links.  The last line  shows the number of over-
            loaded links.  The  notation OV indicates the  links overloaded
            in one direction;  2*OV indicates the links  overloaded in both
            directions.

            Performance Data Command            ________________________

            Syntax:  PERDAT

            PERDAT displays the contents of three log messages that provide
            a variety of  Supervisor performance data generated  during the
            preceding 1 minute interval.  The output consists of six lines,
            in the following form:

            SUP ACTIVITY PER SECOND - ee EXEC LOOPS
                 ii INPUT FOUND oo OUTPUT INHIBITED, LAST BY NODE node#1
            INTERNAL SUP ACTIVITY IN MS - t1 PER EXEC LOOP

            EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION TIMES IN SEC - t5 AVG
                 t6 AVG ADJUSTED t7 PEAK ADJUSTED TIME, FOR NODE node#2

            The first two  lines reflect Supervisor performance  data.  The
            value "ee" is the average number of times per second the Super-
            visor exec loop was  executed in the preceding  1 minute inter-
            val.  The value "ii" is the  average number of times per second
            that input from  the network was found.   The Supervisor checks

            for input during  each cycle of the  Supervisor execution loop.
            The value "oo"  is the average number of times  per second that
            output to the  network was inhibited by flow control  on any of
            the control circuits.  The value "node#1" is the last node that
            restricted the output of data.

            The third and fourth lines show  the average times (in millise-
            conds) required for various internal Supervisor processing dur-
            ing the  preceding 1 minute  interval.  The  value "t1"  is the
            average time required for one cycle of the Supervisor execution
            loop.  The value "t2" is the average time required for the exe-
            cution of  input processing, when  input was found.   The value
            "t3"  is the  time required  to  receive messages  sent to  the
            Supervisor's own node.   The value "t4" is the  peak round trip
            delay.

            The fifth and sixth lines show the average communication delays
            (in seconds) between the Supervisor and other nodes in the net-
            work in the preceding 1 minute  interval.  It selectively tests
            the communication delay with at least one node per second.  The
            value "t5" is the average  delay, including internal delay time
            (t3).  The  value "t6"  is the external  delay time  only.  The
            value  "t7"  is  the  peak   external  delay,  associated  with
            "node#2".

            Read Time Command            _________________

            Syntax:  RTIME

            This command reads  the time from the super  clock and displays
            the current  year, the  Julian date,  and the  time of  day, in
            hours, minutes,  and seconds.  This  command is similar  to the
            output generated by the TIME  command, but the output generated
            by this command includes the current year.

            Example:

                 :rtime
                 1983:247:19:23:58
                 :


            Report Command            ______________

            Syntax:  REPORT L|Sslot#|Mt1[ t2]

            This command, with the "F" option  of the LOG command, controls
            the  output  of certain  node  reports.   Because it  does  not
            restrict the output of other log messages, it is best used with
            the RLOG command and the "C" option  of the LOG command to out-
            put only certain node reports.

            The "L" option restricts the output to Line Error Node Reports.
            The "S" option restricts the output to messages from the speci-
            fied slot "slot#".

            The "M" option  restricts the output to  node reports generated
            by particular slot code running in  an Engine.  If "t1" is less
            than 31, the output is the specified  slot 0 node report gener-
            ated by  node code  (see NODE REPORT  node# TYPE  tt aabbcccc),
            where "t1" is the "TYPE tt" node  report to be output.  If "t1"
            is in the range 31 - 99, the output  is a slot report (see NODE
            REPORT node# FROM  SLOT slot# name TYPE aa  bbcccc), where "t1"
            is the  product identifier  that corresponds  with the  product
            name and product description listed in Appendix B.  The product
            name is output as "name" in the node report.

            The value "t2", when used in conjunction with "t1", specifies a
            range of  node reports to  be output.   The value "t2"  must be
            larger than "t1".

            Send Message Command            ____________________

            Syntax:  SEND x message-text

            This command sends a message to any PROBE user currently logged
            in, where  "x" is  the job label  of the user.   A list  of job
            labels for each PROBE user currently  logged in may be obtained
            with the WHO command.  The maximum length of a PROBE message is
            54 characters.  Any excess characters are not transmitted.

            Example:

                 :send c what is the problem with node 2110?
                 :

            The message received by PROBE user "c" is displayed as follows:

                 FROM B WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH NODE 2110?


            Status Command            ______________

            Syntax:  STAT

            This  command displays  the number  of nodes  in each  takeover
            state,  the Drowsiness  Factor  (DF)  of this  Supervisor,  and
            information regarding login rejects.

            The first line of the display shows the number of nodes in each
            of seven  takeover states.  The  seven takeover  states (0 - 6)
            apply to the TYMNET public network.  Only the last two takeover
            states (5 and 6, noted with  an asterisk below) are relevant in
            independent networks.  All seven states  are described to main-
            tain full compatibility  between the  public network  and inde-
            pendent networks.  The takeover states are as follows:

            State   Description            _____   ___________

              0     The Supervisor  sent a takeover  message to a  TYMNET I
                    node and is waiting for a response.

              1     The Supervisor received an initial response from TYMNET
                    I nodes and has requested more information.

              2     Responses to all previous  requests have been received;
                    the Supervisor is waiting for available core space.

              3     Core space  is available; the Supervisor  has requested
                    final information.

              4     TYMNET I nodes have been completely taken over.

            * 5     TYMNET II nodes are in the process of being taken over.

            * 6     TYMNET II nodes have been completely taken over.

            The notation FROZEN follows the list  of takeover states if the
            Supervisor  is not  operational.  The  data regarding  takeover
            states reflects the  status of the network  when the Supervisor
            froze.  In addition, an operating system status number precedes
            the notation FROZEN  if the Supervisor  is running in  a stand-
            alone Kernel  system (non-ISIS).   The operating  system status
            numbers are:

            Number  Description            ______  ___________

              800   A parity error occurred in the Supervisor.
              500   The Supervisor failed to recover from a crash.
              100   The Supervisor failed to recover from a crash.

            The notation  SLEEPING is  displayed as the  first line  of the
            output if the Supervisor is sleeping.

            The second line of output shows the Drowsiness Factor (DF), the
            reject count,  the origin, and  the destination node  number of
            the last  rejected login attempt.   The drowsiness factor  is a
            period (in seconds) added to  the normal Supervisor sleep time.
            It is used to alter the normal priority of the Supervisors.  It
            can  be changed  only  by those  with  restricted status.   The
            reject count  is the number of  times the Supervisor  could not
            build a  circuit because no path  could be found.  This  may be
            due to shut lines or  nodes without available passthroughs.  If

            Time Command            ____________

            Syntax:  TIME

            The  TIME command  displays  the time  currently  known by  the
            Supervisor.   The Supervisor  reads  the  super clock  when  it
            wakes, and  thereafter keeps time  using the oscillator  on the
            multifunction board.  This command is similar to the RTIME com-
            mand, but it does not output  the current year.  The output has
            the form "ddd:hh:mm:ss"  and contains the Julian  date, and the
            time of  day in hours,  minutes, and  seconds.  If the  time is
            unknown, the system responds with "UNDEFINED TIME".

            Example:

                 :time
                 221:14:53:06

            ceded by the time the data was logged.

            Example:

                 :tstat

            Version Command            _______________

            Syntax:  VERSION

            This command  displays the current version numbers of the PROBE
            and Supervisor  software.  The  version number  for the  Kernel
            software is also included for  a standalone (non-ISIS) Supervi-

            Status 20 Commands            __________________

            This section contains  status 20 commands.  Status  20 commands
            are intended for network operators to  alter the state of links
            in the network.


            Cost Request Command            ____________________

            Syntax: CSTREQ node#1 node#2

            This command causes a message to be sent to "node#1" requesting
            the  aggregate speed  (in  bps) of  all lines  on  the link  to
            "node#2".  The  result is  displayed in  the log  message "LINK
            SPEED FROM NODE  node#1 TO NEIGHBOR node#2  [ss BPS|MS|FROZEN]"
            (1D8).  The  message may by output  using the RLOG  command and
            the "C" option of the LOG command.   The execution of this com-
            mand takes time because it generates data flow in the network.

            Example:

                 :cstreq 2043 2057
                 :rlog 1D8
                 :log c1
                 223:00:10:00
                  LINK SPEED FROM NODE 2043 TO NEIGHBOR 2057 19200 BPS
                 :


            Enter Shut Command            __________________

            Syntax:  ESHUT node#1 node#2

            The ESHUT command adds  an entry to the shut link  table on the
            disk.  The Supervisor reads the shut links table from disk once
            per minute.  Any changes  are noted in the log as  link shut or
            link unshut,  even though the link  may not exist at  that time
            (i.e., if the  nodes at the ends of the  link are unconnected).
            The LSHUT command may be used to read the shut links table.

            The log  message "LINK  SHUT node#1  node#2" is  generated when
            this command is  executed.  The message "FULL"  is displayed if
            the link shut table has reached  its capacity and the specified
            link cannot be added at this time.

            Port Status Command            ___________________

            Syntax:  PSTAT node# Hhost# array#

            PSTAT determines the status of each of the 128 logical ports of
            the specified port  array on the host.  The  command displays a
            list of the numbers of all ports in use.  The port array of 128
            ports is  identified by  a number  (in decimal),  starting with
            zero, i.e., port array 0 = ports  0 through 127, port array 1 =
            ports 128 through 255, etc.  The  numbers listed after the port
            array number in the output are the numbers of the ports in use.

            If host number 0 is specified, all active ISIS Dispatcher ports
            are reported.   On a standalone  (non-ISIS) TYMSAT, all  of the
            TYMSAT ports are reported.

            PSTAT does  not list internal  circuits, those  originating and
            terminating within the same node.  It  lists only external cir-
            cuits, those originating or terminating on another node.

            The log message "PORT STATUS REQUEST  FOR NODE node#" is gener-
            ated when this command is executed.  The execution of this com-
            mand takes time because it generates data flow in the network.

            Example:

            Remove Shut Command            ___________________

            Syntax:  RSHUT node#1 node#2

            The RSHUT command removes a shut entry from the shut link table
            on disk.  The  Supervisor reads the shut links  table from disk
            once per minute.  Any changes are noted in the log as link shut
            or link unshut, even though the link may not exist at that time
            (i.e., if the  nodes at the ends of the  link are unconnected).
            The LSHUT command may be used to read the shut links table.

            The log message  "LINK UNSHUT node#1 node#2"  is generated when
            this command is executed.

            Example:

                 :rshut 2047 2051
                 :


            Synchronous Port Command            ________________________

            Syntax:  SYNPRT node#

            This command determines the status  of the synchronous ports on
            the specified node.  The result is  displayed in PROBE log mes-
            sages, number 1D0, and may be output using the RLOG command and
            the "C"  option of the LOG  command.  The output  shows whether
            the port has ever  been used and whether it is  up or down.  If
            the port is or has been in  use, the output shows the number of
            the node to  which the  specified node  was most  recently con-
            nected.

            The log message "SYNC PORT REQUEST FOR NODE node#" is generated
            when this command  is executed.  The execution  of this command
            takes time because it generates data flow in the network.

            Syntax:  TRACE [node# Hhost# port#]
                           [active-sup-node# Sport#]

            This command traces a circuit from a specified host and port on
            a specified node.  The output contains  a list of nodes through
            which the circuit passes.

            This command may be used with the  CHAN command to trace Super-
            visor control  circuits.  The  "Sport#" option  is the  command
            port number generated by the CHAN command.

            The circuit trace command may be used to trace a circuit from a
            standalone (non-ISIS) TYMSAT by  specifying host 0 in  the com-
            mand.

            The log message "TRACE, NODE node#" is generated when this com-
            mand is  executed.  The  execution of  this command  takes time
            because it generates data flow in the network.

            T2BORI Command            ______________

            Syntax: T2BORI node#1 node#2

            Each node  maintains a  list of  nodes that  have been  causing
            problems (bad guy list),  and it will not bring up  a line to a
            node on that list.  This command removes "node#2" from the "bad
            guy"  list on  "node#1".   The  log message  "BORI (T-2),  NODE
            node#" is generated when this command is executed.

            Example:

            :t2bori 2041 2067

            User Log Alpha Command            ______________________

            Syntax:  ULOGA abcdefgh

            This command enters an  operator-generated message (alphabetic)
            in the  log message "OPERATOR MESSAGE  HEX aaaa bbbb  cccc dddd
            ASCII abcdefgh".   The message  may be as  many as  eight ASCII
            characters.   The message  is  placed in  a  buffer before  the
            Supervisor copies it  into the log.  If that  buffer contains a
            message which the Supervisor has not yet copied to the log, the
            system will  wait up  to 15 seconds  for the  buffer to  become
            available.  If the buffer  does not become available,  the mes-
            sage "UNABLE TO SEND MESSAGE TO LOG" is displayed.

            This command  should be  entered only on  a Supervisor  that is
            awake.  Sending  a message to  a frozen or  sleeping Supervisor
            fills the common buffer, making it unavailable for further use.
            It will  remain filled  until the  Supervisor awakes,  at which
            time the message is logged.

            User Log Hex Command            ____________________

            Syntax:  ULOGH aaaa[ bbbb[ cccc[ dddd]]]

            This command enters an operator-generated message (in hexadeci-
            mal) in  the log message "OPERATOR  MESSAGE HEX aaaa  bbbb cccc
            dddd ASCII abcdefgh".  The message may be as many as four half-
            words.  The message is placed in a buffer before the Supervisor
            copies it  into the  log.  If  that buffer  contains a  message
            which the Supervisor has not yet  copied to the log, the system
            will wait up to 15 seconds for  the buffer to become available.
            If the buffer does not become available, the message "UNABLE TO
            SEND MESSAGE TO LOG" is displayed.

            This command  should be  entered only on  a Supervisor  that is

            Status 10 commands are intended  for network operators to alter
            the state of links in the network.


            Clear Node Command            __________________

            Syntax:  CLEAR node#

            CLEAR removes the restrictions on all  shut links on the speci-
            fied node, making them available  to the Supervisor for circuit
            building.  The log message  "LINK UNSHUT node#1 node2#" is gen-
            erated for each link that is cleared  when this command is exe-
            cuted.

            Example:

                 :clear 2030
                 :


            Downline Load Command            _____________________

            Syntax:  DLOAD node#

            DLOAD causes  the specified node  to execute its  downline load
            bootstrap program.   The log message "DLOAD NODE node#  LINE 0"
            is generated when this command is executed.

            This command relies on  the Engine's watchdog timer  being ena-
            bled.  If  the timer is  not enabled,  the node halts  when the
            DLOAD command  is executed,  and it  is impossible  to start  a
            downline load.

            Example:

                 :dload 2057

            Node Shut Command            _________________

            Syntax:  NSHUT node#

            NSHUT shuts all links on the  specified node.  Following execu-
            tion of the command, execute the RSHUT command to open one link
            to the  node.  The message FULL  is displayed if the  link shut
            table has reached  its capacity and no more links  can be added
            at this  time.  The  log message "LINK  SHUT node#1  node#2" is
            generated for each link that is shut  when this command is exe-
            cuted.

            Example:

                 :nshut 2020
                 :rshut 2020 2010

            Retake Node Command            ___________________

            Syntax:  RETAKE node#

            This command  causes the Supervisor  to release control  of the
            specified node, and to regain control  of that node through the
            takeover process.  The log  message "RETAKE node#" is generated
            when this command is executed.

            Example:

            Spy Command            ___________

            Syntax:  SPY

            SPY outputs a listing of the last  32 executions of the follow-
            ing commands: ESHUT, NSHUT, RSHUT,  CLEAR, FREEZE, THAW, SLEEP,
            DLOAD, AWAKE, TWAKE, HANG, ETIME, FTIME, or RETAKE.  PROBE logs
            an entry into a circular buffer each time one of these commands
            is executed.  The output consists of the username that executed
            the command,  a one-letter abbreviation  for each  command, and
            the time  the command  was issued.   The abbreviations  for the

            Status 01 Commands            __________________

            Status 01  commands are  intended for  lead network  operators.
            These commands  are very powerful; they  are used to  alter the
            state of network Supervisors.


            Awake Command            _____________

            Syntax:  AWAKE

            This command awakens a sleeping Supervisor  and prints the cur-
            rent time.  This  command overrides all previous  reasons for a
            Supervisor being  asleep, including a large  drowsiness factor.
            If the  time is undefined and  no super clock is  available, an
            operator must enter the time  before the Supervisor will awake.
            An  operator must  wait at  least 8 seconds  after putting  the
            Supervisor to sleep  before waking it again.   The message "SUP
            NOT READY, TRY  AGAIN LATER" is displayed if  the AWAKE command
            is issued too soon.

            An operator is  prompted for his current  PROBE password, which
            is not echoed at the terminal.  The log message "AWAKE COMMAND"
            is generated when this command is executed.

            Example:

                 :awake
                 PASSWORD:
                 160:23:10:02

            Cipher Command            ______________

            Syntax:  PSWD

            This command displays the  cipher (in hexadecimal) for  a pass-
            word.  It  is used to  prepare usernames and  default passwords
            that are assembled into the PROBE Tymfile at system generation.
            An operator is prompted twice for a password, which is not ech-
            oed at the terminal.  The cipher follows the password prompts.

            Example:

                 :pswd
                 PASSWORD:
                 TYPE AGAIN:

                 :


            Class Command            _____________

            Syntax:  CLASS

            This  command causes  the Supervisor  to read  class and  group
            tables from disk,  but only if the Supervisor  is awake.  These
            definitions, and the access profiles in each Master User Direc-
            tory (MUD)  entry determine access control.   These definitions
            are automatically read  when a Supervisor awakes.   The utility
            program  that creates  and modifies  these definitions  updates
            only the  disk.  The log  message "CLASS AND  GROUP DEFINITIONS
            READ" is generated when this command is executed.

            Example:

                 :class
                 :

            Drowsiness Factor Command            _________________________

            Syntax:  DF nnn

            DF increases this Supervisor's sleep time by the specified num-
            ber  of seconds,  thereby altering  the Supervisor's  priority.
            Supervisors' sleep times are staggered  to control which Super-
            visor awakens next if the active Supervisor ceases to function.
            A dormant  Supervisor automatically  awakes if  its sleep  time
            elapses  without having  received any  sleeping  pills from  an
            active Supervisor.   The STAT  command displays  the drowsiness
            factor of a particular Supervisor.

            Example:

                 :df 30
                 :


            Enter Command            _____________

            Syntax:  ENTER position#  name  status#

            The ENTER command changes the list of usernames stored on disk.
            There are 128 positions on the disk for PROBE usernames, in the
            range 0 - 127, (in  decimal).  Possible  changes include  addi-
            tions, deletions,  change of  status, change  of position,  and
            change of username.  Any changes made  apply only to the Super-
            visor on which they are made.   The LIST command outputs a list
            of usernames.

            A username may  be from three to eight characters  long and may
            include letters and numbers.

            Status numbers are  two octal digits (six bits)  long, with one
            bit for  each status class.   The status number  being assigned
            must be equal to the sum of status levels for which an operator
            is to  be authorized.  The range  of the numbers is  0 - 77 (in
            octal);  only 0 - 37  are meaningful.   A status  number of  20
            allows an operator to execute status  20 commands; 30 allows an
            operator  to execute  status 10  and status  20 commands.   One
            operator cannot assign  a status to a new entry  that is higher
            than the  status he  has himself.   PROBE will  respond with  a
            question mark if this is attempted.

            The system assigns  a default password to  new usernames, which
            is a system generation parameter.   It is the responsibility of

            The status  required to use  this command may  be set to  02 at
            system generation.

            Examples:

            :enter 49               (Removes entry 49 from the user list.)

            :enter 63 user44 00     (Enters the  name user44  into position
                                    63 and authorizes that  user to execute
                                    commands with no status.

            :enter 5 user19 20      (Enters the name user19 into position 5
                                    and  authorizes  that user  to  execute

            :enter 4 USER12 30      (Enters the name user12 into position 4
                                    and  authorizes  that user  to  execute
                                    status 20 and status 10 commands.)

            :enter 0 user9 37       (Enters the name user9  into position 0
                                    and authorizes that user to execute all
                                    commands.)


            Enter Time Command            __________________

            Syntax:  ETIME

            This command  sets the time to  be used by the  Supervisor.  An
            operator is not  prompted for the time if the  Supervisor has a
            super clock.  The Supervisor reads  the super clock and updates
            the time.  If the super clock is not available, or if it is not
            functioning, the operator are prompted for  the time.  The sys-
            tem prompts for  the year, the day  of the year, the  hour, and
            the minute.

            Use extreme care when entering the time.  Erroneous entries may
            cause a significant loss of network accounting data.

            Examples:

                 :etime                 (Supervisor reads the super clock.)

                 :etime                 (No super clock is available; the
                                        operator is prompted for the time.)
                 ENTER TIME YYYY:DD:HH:MM 1983:204:16:45
                 :

            Freeze Command            ______________

            Syntax:  FREEZE

            This command removes the Supervisor from the network completely
            for debugging purposes, for clearing the accounting files using
            the INITA  command, or  for clearing  the log  files using  the
            INITL command (see Appendix A).   Otherwise, the FREEZE command
            is used only if  there is a severe malfunction  of the Supervi-
            sor.  The Supervisor is removed from the  run queue and is nei-
            ther active nor dormant.  The THAW command returns the Supervi-
            sor to the run queue.

            An operator is  prompted for his current  PROBE password, which
            is not  echoed at the terminal.   The system responds  with the
            message "SUP FROZEN" when the command has been executed.

            Example:

                 :freeze
                 PASSWORD:
                 SUP FROZEN
                 :


            Hang Command            ____________

            Syntax:  HANG x

            The HANG command logs off the user  who has job label "x".  Use
            the WHO command to determine the  job labels of users currently
            logged in.

            Example:

                 :hang g
                 :

            List Usernames Command            ______________________

            Syntax:  LIST

            This  command  lists all  of  the  PROBE usernames.   The  list
            includes  position numbers  and  status  bits.  The  list  also
            includes  usernames assembled  into the  PROBE Tymfile.   These
            usernames are preceded by AAA rather than the position number.

            The position  number is  followed by  an asterisk  if a  user's
            password is  the default  password.  Use  the ENTER  command to
            change the user list.

            Example:

                 :list
                 AAA LEAD1 37
                 000 OP12 34
                 001*PHOENIX 00
                 002 XPRESSO 37
                 :


            Sleep Command            _____________

            Syntax:  SLEEP

            This command puts  an active  Supervisor to  sleep for  mainte-
            nance, for testing, or to avoid a  conflict when a new Supervi-
            sor is brought up.

            An operator is  prompted for his current  PROBE password, which
            is not  echoed at  terminal.  The  system displays  the message
            "SLEEPING", and generates the log  message "SLEEP COMMAND" when
            the command is executed.

            Example:

                 :sleep
                 PASSWORD:
                 SLEEPING
                 :

            PROBE Reference Manual                       September 30, 1983


            Thaw Command            ____________

            Syntax:  THAW

            This command restarts the Supervisor  as though the system were
            being brought up.  The Supervisor  enters the sleep state after
            it  finishes initialization,  which may  take several  minutes.
            During initialization, the time becomes undefined.  The correct
            time  is established  when the  Supervisor  enters the  dormant
            state if there is  a super clock.  If there is  no super clock,
            enter the  time using  the ETIME  command.  The  same procedure
            must be followed if there is no super clock, and the Supervisor
            crashes.

            THAW causes  the Supervisor to  be restarted regardless  of its
            current state (frozen, sleeping, or active).

            An operator is  prompted for his current  PROBE password, which
            is not echoed at the terminal.

            Example:

                 :thaw
                 PASSWORD:
                 :


            TWAKE Command            _____________

            Syntax:  TWAKE

            This command  has the same effect  as the AWAKE  command except
            that it also  executes the CSTAT command  causing status output
            every 15 seconds until an escape  is entered.  An operator must
            wait at least  8 seconds after putting the  Supervisor to sleep
            before waking it again.  The message  "SUP NOT READY, TRY AGAIN
            LATER" is displayed if the TWAKE command is issued too soon.

            An operator is  prompted for his current  PROBE password, which
            is not echoed at the terminal.  The log message "AWAKE COMMAND"
            is generated when this command is executed.

            LOG MESSAGES            ____________

            This section contains PROBE  log messages.  Its two  major sec-
            tions list the messages in alphabetic order and by message num-
            ber.  The first section is a list of the log messages, arranged
            in alphabetic  order.  Each entry  includes the  message number
            and a full explanation of the message.  The second section is a
            list of log messages arranged by message number.  This list may
            be used in conjunction  with the LOG command and  the RLOG com-
            mand.

            Message output is displayed  at the terminal in  uppercase let-
            ters.  Variable portions of the message  are shown in this sec-
            tion in lowercase letters.  Words enclosed in brackets ([]) and
            separated by  a vertical bar  (|) are a  list of items,  one of
            which will appear.

            Depending on what  they represent, the values  displayed in the
            log messages make  use of different numbering  systems.  Unless
            otherwise noted, the values are as follows:

                 Item            Type          Symbol                 ____            ____          ______

                 Block number    Hexadecimal   block#
                 Code address    Hexadecimal   address
                 Host            Decimal       host#
                 Line            Decimal       line#
                 Node            Octal         node#, node1#, node2#

                 Unknown value   Hexadecimal   #

            Most of the messages in this section are oriented to the opera-
            tions  environment.   However, some  messages  indicate  system
            problems, and should be referred to your technical support rep-
            resentative.  They are noted in this section.

            Log Messages Arranged Alphabetically            ____________________________________

            This section  is a  list of  all PROBE  log messages,  arranged
            alphabetically.  Each  entry includes  the message  output, the
            message number, and an explanation  of each message.  To select
            only certain  log messages for  output, use the  message number

            Message number:  28

            This message shows  the number of  blocks left in  the Supervi-
            sor's accounting file.  It is first  displayed when half of the
            available blocks have been  written but have not  yet been col-
            lected by  RAM, and  appears with  increasing frequency  as the
            number of uncollected accounting  blocks increases.  Either RAM
            is not collecting accounting data, or it is far behind in doing
            so.  If the  file becomes full, the Supervisor  will write over

            uncollected  data.  If  the number  of  accounting blocks  left
            drops below 100,  control of the network  should be transferred
            to a  Supervisor that  has blocks  available in  its accounting
            file.


            AWAKE COMMAND

            Message number:  20

            The PROBE AWAKE or TWAKE command has been executed.


            BAD MUD AT BLOCK block#

            Message number:  A0

            A disk error occurred while the Supervisor was reading this MUD
            block.  If  this message recurs,  disk maintenance  is probably
            required.  If an operator logs in when this occurs, the message
            "BAD MUD" is displayed at the terminal.


            BAD RECORD node# hhhhhhhh

            Message number:  48

            An invalid Supervisor  message was detected from  the specified

            BLACK BALL RECEIVED ON COMMAND CIRCUIT FOR NODE node#
                 PORT port# LOST bb BYTES

            Message number:  210

            A buffer zap was detected in  a command circuit, and "bb" bytes
            of Supervisory  data were  lost on the  command circuit  of the
            specified port on the specified node.  The Supervisor initiated
            a retake of that node.

            BORI (T-2) FAILURE, NODE node#

            Message number:  20

            The  Supervisor was  not  able to  execute  the T2BORI  command
            because the specified node  was not controlled by  the Supervi-
            sor.


            BORI (T-2), NODE node#

            Message number:  20

            The Supervisor executed the T2BORI command to restore a BORI in
            the specified node.


            CANNOT READ CLASS & GROUP DEF'S, DISK ERROR hhhhhhhh

            Message number:  168

            A disk error  occurred when the Supervisor tried  to read class
            and group definitions.   The first four digits  of the response
            (in hexadecimal) are the status, and the second four digits (in
            hexadecimal) are the virtual disk address.


            CANNOT TAKEOVER NODE node#1 THRU NODE node#2

            Message number:  1C0

            The  Supervisor  could  not build  a  control  circuit  through
            "node#2" node to take over "node#1".


            CIRCUIT TOO LONG FROM NODE node# TO HOST host#

            Message number:  1A0

            The only  available circuit for  this login  is too long  for a
            needle.  Check the network topology for link outages.

            CIRCUITS AVG LENGTH dd, COST cc; MAX LENGTH md, COST mc

            Message number:  250

            During the preceding 1 minute interval, the Average Length of a
            User's (ALU)  virtual circuit had  "dd" links, and  the average
            circuit  cost was  "cc".  The  longest circuit  built had  "md"
            links, and the highest cost circuit built was "mc".


            CLASS class# TOO LARGE

            Message number:  110

            After reading the  class definitions from disk,  the Supervisor
            checked them for consistency and  found this class (in decimal)
            to be too large.  Check the  program generating the class defi-
            nitions, reload the  Supervisor with them, and  issue the CLASS

            during the  preceding 1 minute interval.  The  Supervisor tests
            the delay  between itself  and network  nodes at  a rate  of at
            least one node per second, cycling  through all of the nodes in
            the network before repeating the test.   The sampling rate is a
            configuration parameter.  The value "t1"  is the average delay,
            including the internal  delay.  The value "t2"  is the external

             0  The ISIS Kernel zapped some buffers to provide room for new
                data.  The  value "bb"  is the  buffer number  zapped.  The

             1  This indicates  that the  ISIS Kernel  crashed.  The  value
                "bb" is  the crash code.  See  Appendix C to  determine the
                reason for  the crash.  The value  "cccc" is the  number of

            23  There is a disk  error.  The message repeats  every 15 min-
                utes for as  long as the disk is unusable.   The reason for
                the failure, indicated by "bbbb", is:

                0001  The disk area is too small for RAM's use.

                0002  A bad  status condition  was returned  from the  disk
                      unit or the controller.

                0003  A checksum  error occurred  with data  retrieved from
                      the disk.

            24  Invalid accounting data was received  from the network, and
                RAM ignored it.  The value "bbbb"  is the number of invalid
                records ignored by RAM.  This message repeats every 15 min-
                utes for as long as the invalid data exists.

            28  The current session number is not one greater than the pre-
                vious session number.  This occurs when a new Supervisor is
                awakened, in  which case  approximately 45  session numbers
                may be skipped.  It also  occurs when the Supervisor builds
                a command  circuit, in  which case  the session  counter is
                incremented but no accounting data is reported.  The Super-
                visor can be optioned to generate a special accounting mes-
                sage to account  for these command circuits.   This reduces
                the occurrences of this message.

                This message is sent if any discrepancy in the session num-
                ber count  was detected in  the preceding  15 minutes.  The
                value "bbbb" is  the number of times  the increment between
                successive session numbers was other than one.

            29  The  Supervisor has  passed  RAM  (wraparound).  The  value
                "bbbb" is the  RAM accounting block number  that was passed
                by the Supervisor.

                retransmission  count  was  not  exceeded,  the  frame  was
                retransmitted.  Otherwise, a reset frame was sent.

            81  An information  frame was received  with the poll  bit set,
                indicating a retransmitted frame.

            82  LAP, LAPB,  and SLP  protocols: While  acting as  a primary
                station, the  interface received  a frame  that was  not an

                FML protocol: While acting as a primary station, the inter-
                face received a reset or an  information frame with its own
                address.

                This indicates that the line is looping back.

            83  HDLC with  LAP, LAPB, and  SLP protocols: An idle  line was
                detected in accordance with  the IDLELINE system generation

                the secondary station while  in the "information_transfer",
                "frame_reject", reset, or "timer_recovery" state.

            88  HDLC protocol: A transmit or receive  clock was found to be
                disabled on a line that was not an optically coupled line.

            89  HDLC protocol:  An overrun  interrupt occurred  in the  SIO
                processor.

            8A  HDLC with  LAP or LAPB protocols:  A frame longer  than the
                maximum allowable length was encountered and ignored.

                BSC protocol: A DLE/EOT abort sequence was received.

            8B  HDLC  protocol:  A frame  too  short  to be  validated  was

            This is the  generic format of a node report  indicating a line
            error.  Some line errors are not reported unless the occurrence
            exceeds a certain threshold, noted  below.  The reasons for the
            line errors are:

            BAD ACK FROM [NODE node#|AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR]
            An invalid acknowledgement was received on a line.  If the line
            is attached to  a link (up), the  neighbor node number  is dis-
            played.  If the line is not attached  to a link, the phrase "AN
            UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR" is displayed.

            BAD BORI FROM [NODE node#|AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR]
            An invalid BORI was received on a line.  This message is likely

            CROSS TALK FROM [NODE node#|AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR]
            Crosstalk occurred on a line,  which means essentially that the
            node  issuing the  report is  receiving  its own  transmission.
            This may  happen if a  port on a node  sends a message  that is
            received by another port on the same  node, a modem is in loop-
            back, or it may  be caused by a hardware problem.   If the line
            is attached to  a link (up), the  neighbor node number  is dis-
            played.  If the line is not attached  to a link, the phrase "AN
            UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR" is displayed.

            HDLC ABORTS FROM [NODE node#|AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR]
            An SIO HDLC abort occurred on a  line.  If the line is attached
            to a link (up), the neighbor  node number is displayed.  If the
            line is not attached  to a link, the phrase  "AN UNKNOWN NEIGH-
            BOR" is displayed.

            HDLC CHECKSUM ERRORS FROM [NODE node#|AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR]
            An SIO HDLC checksum error occurred on  a line.  If the line is
            attached to a link (up), the neighbor node number is displayed.
            If the line is  not attached to a link, the  phrase "AN UNKNOWN
            NEIGHBOR" is displayed.

            RETRANSMISSIONS FROM [NODE node#|AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR]
            The number  of retransmissions  received on  a line  exceeded a
            threshold of 1 in  8.  If the line is attached  to a link (up),
            the neighbor  node number  is displayed.   If the  line is  not
            attached to a  link, the phrase  "AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR"  is dis-
            played.

            RETRANSMISSIONS TO [NODE node#|AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR]
            The number of retransmissions sent on a line exceeded a thresh-
            old of  1 in 8.  If  the line is  attached to a link  (up), the
            neighbor node number is displayed.  If the line is not attached
            to a link, the phrase "AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR" is displayed.

            SPACING ON LINE FROM [NODE node#|AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR]
            Sixteen or more  consecutive 0's were received on  a line while
            not receiving a record.   This is usually caused  by communica-
            tions channel errors.  If the line  is attached to a link (up),
            the neighbor  node number  is displayed.   If the  line is  not
            attached to a  link, the phrase  "AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR"  is dis-
            played.

            This node report is logged for a given node when a new entry is

            of neighbors  a node  may have is  predetermined in  the node's

                 aaaa = Neighbor node number + 8000
                 bbbb = Number of channels

            If a  new circuit is  built over a link  that has used  all its
            allocated channels, the  link is said to  bubble.  Channels are
            allotted in increments of 128.  The bubble process allocates an
            additional half-page of permuter table  space on the node.  If,
            for example, a link  has all its 256 channels in  use, the next
            circuit to  be built causes the  link to bubble,  allocating an
            additional 128 channels to the link's permuter table space.  At
            that time,  the link  has 257  channels active  out of  its 384
            allocated.

            The link bubble  process should be viewed in terms  of pairs of
            links.  When  the link bubble  process occurs on  the specified
            node, it also occurs on the neighbor node of the link.

                 aaaa = Neighbor node number + 8000
                 bbbb = Number of channels

            The link shrink process is the reverse of link bubble.  If four
            times the number of inactive channels  is greater than the num-
            ber  of channels  allocated plus  600,  the link  shrinks by  a
            half-page  of permuter  table  space.   This recovers  permuter
            table space for assignment to other links as traffic demands.

            The link shrink  process should be viewed in terms  of pairs of
            links.  When  the link  shrink procedure occurs  on a  node, it
            also occurs on the neighbor node of the link.

            The node encountered and recovered from a MAC error (other than
            a DMA timeout)  in a part of  the code that uses  the MAC ABEND
            (fail-soft) facility.   If the  error occurred  in SYLVER  (the
            line  receiver routine),  no other  action was  taken.  If  the
            error occurred in RMAKE or RTD,  the link being serviced at the
            time of  the error  was snipped.   The virtual  address of  the
            error is aaaaaaaa.  The  MAC ABEND facility is invoked  by cer-
            tain parts of the code unless the frequency of all types of MAC
            errors  exceeds  one  in  4 minutes, in  which  case  the  node
            crashes.

            A MAC error  occurred because of a DMA timeout.   The number of
            SIO lines on the node is  reported in aaaa because this problem
            is seen almost exclusively on machines with SIO.  Bit 24 of the
            MAC interrupt status register (bit 8 of "bbbb") is set to indi-
            cate a  DMA timeout.  The  node sends  the report but  takes no
            other action  for a DMA timeout  unless there is more  than one
            occurrence of any type of MAC  error in a 4 minute interval, in
            which case the  node crashes.  If the node receives  a flood of
            DMA timeouts (indicating  an SIO  hardware fault  or misconnec-
            tion), the node halts unconditionally (light bar on).

            To obtain the temperature in degrees  Celsius, divide the deci-
            mal equivalent of the two hexadecimal digits by 2.56.  For ISIS

            TAKEOVER ERROR reason

            Message number:  148

            A node takeover  error occurred.  The possible  reasons for the
            error are:

            DUPLICATE NEIGHBOR NODE node#1 TO NEIGHBOR node#2
            Node "node#1" claimed  that it had a link to  the same neighbor
            "node#2" more than once, which  is a topological impossibility.
            The Supervisor zapped the BORI of the link to the node from the
            upstream neighbor, cutting the node out of the network.

            ILLEGAL NEIGHBOR NUMBER NODE node#1 TO NEIGHBOR node#2
            Node "node#2", a neighbor of "node#1", has an illegal node num-

            of the link to "node#2", cutting it out of the network.

            ILLEGAL NEIGHBOR NUMBER NODE node#
            The specified  node number is  invalid.  The  Supervisor zapped
            the BORI  of the link to  the node from the  upstream neighbor,
            cutting the node out of the network.

            NEIGHBOR DOES NOT KNOW US NODE node#1 TO NEIGHBOR NODE node#2
            The specified node claimed "node#2" as a neighbor, but "node#2"
            has not claimed "node#1" as  a neighbor.  The Supervisor zapped
            the BORI on the link in "node#1" to "node#2".

            NODE IS OWN NEIGHBOR NODE node#1 TO NEIGHBOR node#2
            The  specified node  has  claimed itself  as  a neighbor.   The
            Supervisor zapped  the BORI of  the link  to the node  from the
            upstream neighbor, cutting the node out of the network.

            TOO MANY HOSTS NODE node#
            The specified node claimed more  hosts than is permitted, which
            is a serious error.  The Supervisor zapped the BORI of the link
            from the upstream neighbor to  the specified node,  cutting the
            node out of the network.

            TOO MANY LINKS NODE node#
            The specified node  claims that it has either no  links or more
            links than is permitted, which is  a serious error.  The Super-
            visor zapped the BORI of the link from the upstream node to the
            specified node, cutting the node out of the network.

            WRONG SUP NUMBER RETURNED NODE node#
            The specified  node responded to  a takeover, but  the response
            was to another Supervisor's  request.  The Supervisor attempted
            to retake the node.


            TAKEOVER FAILURE STATE state NODE node#

            Message number:  140

            The takeover  of the  specified node was  not completed  in the
            time allowed.  The  takeover progressed to the  state indicated
            (in octal), and the Supervisor initiated a takeover of the node
            again.  See the STAT command for  a description of the takeover
            states.

            Message number:  260

            The time was entered using the  ETIME command.  If the Supervi-
            sor had a super clock, ETIME  instructed the Supervisor to read
            the super clock to update its time.   If it had no super clock,
            the operator was prompted to enter the time.  The message shows
            the old time; the timestamp of the message shows the new time.

            Message number:  F0

            The  specified logical  port is  flooding  the Supervisor  with
            login characters.


            TOO MANY INVALID PASSWORDS, NODE node# mm OUT OF tt

            Message number:  2B8

            An excessive number of invalid  passwords were submitted to the
            Supervisor  by the  specified node.   An  invalid password  was
            detected "mm" times out of "tt" passwords submitted.  This mes-
            sage is generated every 10 minutes if  the error rate is exces-
            sive.


            TOO MANY INVALID USERNAMES, NODE node# mm OUT OF tt

            Message number:  2B0

            An excessive number of invalid  usernames were submitted to the
            Supervisor  by the  specified node.   An  invalid username  was
            detected "mm" times out of "tt" usernames submitted.  This mes-
            sage is generated every 10 minutes if  the error rate is exces-

            TOO MANY LOGIN SESSION FAILURES, NODE node# mm OUT OF  tt

            Message number:  2C0

            An excessive login session failure rate  occurred on the speci-
            fied node.  Failures occurred "mm" times out of "tt" login ses-
            sions.   This message  counts all  login sessions  that do  not
            result  in a  virtual circuit,  regardless of  the reason.   It
            includes login  sessions that have  been terminated  because of
            excessive errors, such as bad  usernames or bad passwords.  The
            message is  generated every 10 minutes  if the failure  rate is
            excessive.


            TRACE FAILURE, NODE node#

            Message number:  20

            The Supervisor failed  to execute the TRACE  command because it
            does not control the specified node.


            TRACE, NODE node#

            Message number:  20

            The Supervisor  executed the TRACE  command to trace  a circuit
            from the specified node.


            TYMNET II MESSAGE INVALID SUBTYPE tt NODE node#

            Message number:  78

            An invalid  subtype "tt" was detected  in a node  to Supervisor
            message.  Contact your technical support representative.


            UNABLE TO TAKE OVER NODE node# BECAUSE COST TOO LARGE

            Message Number:  58

            The Supervisor could  not take over the  specified node because
            the cost of building a circuit to it was too great.

            Message number:  58

            The Supervisor could  not take over the  specified node because
            it could not build a circuit to it.


            UNEXPECTED TAKEOVER RESPONSE FROM NODE node#

            Message number:  18

            The Supervisor  received an  unexpected takeover  response from
            the specified node and initiated a retake of that node.


            UNOVERLOADED NODE node#1 TO node#2

            Message number:  180

            This message reports   that the link between  the two specified
            nodes is no longer considered overloaded.

            PROBE Reference Manual                       September 30, 1983


                            APPENDIX A, RESTRICTED COMMANDS


            This section  contains status 02  commands.  They  are intended
            for network maintenance personnel and system programmers.  They
            are used for system maintenance and for disaster recovery.


            DCENT Command            _____________

            Syntax:  DCENT n1 n2

            This command, entered  by network maintenance personnel  for an
            independent  network, gives  a senior  systems programmer  from
            Tymshare's Network  Technology Division  (NTD) temporary,  con-
            trolled access  to the independent  network to resolve  a major
            network problem.

            If, for example, the Master User  Directory (MUD) on the active
            Supervisor malfunctions  and prevents  further logins,  contact
            your technical support representative.  The representative will
            obtain a password cipher (two octal numbers) from a senior sys-
            tems programmer at NTD and give them to you.

            A member of the network maintenance staff currently logged into
            PROBE may enter these two numbers "n1" and "n2" using the DCENT
            command.  If  necessary, he may connect  a terminal to  the TTY
            port  on the  multifunction card  of  the Engine  on which  the
            Supervisor is  running, log  into PROBE  with a  PROBE username
            assembled-into the  Tymfile, and  enter the  two numbers  using
            this command.   A senior systems  programmer from NTD  can then
            bypass the MUD on the independent network and log into the net-
            work to resolve the problem.

            Once the problem has been resolved,  clear the cipher by enter-
            ing two zeros with the DCENT command.  The security of the net-
            work  is  preserved  because NTD  staff  cannot log  in if  the
            cipher has been cleared.

            Example:

                 :dcent 6445244 71172757
                 :

            DCREAD Command            ______________

            Syntax:  DCREAD

            This command is used to read  the current value of the password
            cipher that enables Tymshare NTD staff to access an independent
            network to  resolve a  major problem.   See the  DCENT command.
            The value  for the password cipher  should be set only  for the
            duration of  the problem.   It should be  cleared at  all other
            times.

            Example:

                 :dcread
                 0 0
                 :


            Fix Time Command            ________________

            Syntax:  FTIME [+|-]seconds

            This command corrects  the super clock  time by adding  or sub-
            tracting as many as 2047 seconds from the super clock time.

            Because  of  hardware  restrictions, the  super  clock  can  be
            updated only  when it is in  a particular configuration.   As a
            result, this command may  take up to 1 hour, 8  minutes, and 16
            seconds to execute.  The system  displays the number of seconds
            it will take before the correction occurs; the terminal will be
            locked for this period.  The change  may be aborted by entering
            an escape, but the super clock will not be updated.

            Example:

                 :ftime -2                (Set the clock back by 2 seconds)
                 BUSY - WAITING 142 SEC

            Accounting File Initialization Command            ______________________________________

            Syntax: INITA

            This command initializes the accounting  file to all zeros.  It
            should be executed  only after disk  maintenance has  been per-
            formed.  Executing  it at any  other time  destroys uncollected
            accounting data.  This command can only be executed on a frozen
            Supervisor.  This command may take  several minutes to complete
            execution.

            After the INITA command has been executed, thaw the Supervisor.
            The THAW command  causes the Supervisor to start writing at the
            beginning of  the file.  It can  be executed regardless  of the
            state of the Supervisor.

            Example:

                 :inita
                 :


            Log Initialization Command            __________________________

            Syntax:  INITL

            This command  initializes the  log to  all zeros.   The command
            should executed only after disk maintenance has been performed.
            Executing it at any other time  destroys the log.  This command
            can be executed only on a  frozen Supervisor.  This command may
            take several minutes to complete execution.

            After the command has been  executed, thaw the Supervisor.  The
            THAW command   causes the  Supervisor to  start writing  at the
            beginning of  the file.  It can  be executed regardless  of the
            state of the Supervisor.

            Example:

                 :initl
                 :

            This section  contains a  list of  the product  identifiers (in
            hexadecimal) and  product names  used  to  indicate the  inter-
            face(s) running in  an Engine.  One of  the product identifiers
            or product names  listed below may be output in  one of several
            node  reports.  The  product identifiers  may also  be used  to
            limit the display  of node reports  to those generated  by spe-
            cific code.

                                APPENDIX C, CRASH CODES


            This section lists the ISIS crash  codes that are output as the
            value "aa" in the following node reports:

                 NODE REPORT nnnn FROM SLOT 63 I2IS TYPE 1 aa bbcccc
                 NODE REPORT nnnn TYPE 19 aabbbbbb

            This section also lists the crash code extensions that are out-
            put for some of  the the crash codes.  These  crash code exten-
            sions   are output  as the  value  "aa" in  the following  node
            report:

                 NODE REPORT nnnn TYPE 2A aabbccdd

            Because the  "TYPE 19" node report  outputs the crash  code and
            the "TYPE 2A"  node report outputs the crash  code extension, a
            "TYPE 2A"  node report is always  preceded by a "TYPE  19" node
            report.

            The  following  list  contains  the crash  codes  and  a  brief
            description of each.  A number followed  by an "x" (2x, 3x, 4x,
            etc.) indicates the generic type of  the crash code.  An aster-
            isk indicates that crash code  extensions relating to the crash
            code are described in greater detail below.

            The following crash codes indicate  hardware crashes on an ISIS
            node.

            Crash Code  Meaning            __________  _______

                 0      Manual restart

              indicates one of the following conditions:

              aa   Meaning              __   _______

              02   A legal instruction was interrupted  several times by an
                   illegal instruction.

              06   An enhanced  instruction was  interrupted by  a spurious

              02   An error  was detected  during the  execution of  a jump
                   find first one (JFFO) instruction in the BIDDY routine.

              04   An error  was detected  during the  execution of  a jump
                   find first one halfword (JFFOH)  instruction in the BIDH
                   routine.

              06   An error  was detected  during the  execution of  a JFFO
                   instruction in the BID routine.

              08   An error  was detected  during the  execution of  a JFFO

            CRASH CODE 63 - A software inconsistency was detected by system
              software.   The value  "aa" is  a crash  code extension  that
              indicates one of the following conditions.

              aa   Meaning              __   _______

              02   The  EXEC routine  tried to  dispatch  to a  nonexistent
                   process.

              04   A link marked inactive had one or more lines attached to
                   it.

              06   A link marked active had no lines attached to it.

              08   One of  the lines  that was  supposedly attached  to the
                   specified link  was attached to another  neighbor.  This
                   error could occur during the line attach process because
                   of line errors.

              0A   An inactive line was attached to a link.

              0C   The number of lines  attached to a link  was not consis-
                   tent  with the  value  in the  NLAT  field  of the  link
                   descriptor.

              0E   An invalid status  code (not 1 or 2)  was reported after
                   an attempt was made to chain  a new output command on an
                   SIO line.  This indicates a  possible SIO hardware prob-
                   lem.

              12   The RMAKE  routine was about  to build a  logical record
                   for a channel and discovered  that its source buffer was
                   empty.

              14   The RMAKE routine  was trying to build  a logical record
                   containing only one byte of data, but the byte was "00",
                   "01", or "02".  None of these values is valid by itself.
                   The byte is probably the first byte of a control charac-
                   ter pair that was separated from its mate.

              16   The RMAKE routine  was trying to build  a logical record
                   containing only one byte of data, but the byte was "03".
                   This value is not valid by itself.  The byte is probably
                   the first  byte of a  character pair that  was separated
                   from its mate.

              18   The RMAKE routine was about to process a needle but dis-
                   covered that there wasn't supposed to be a needle for it
                   to process.

              1A   The RMAKE routine was processing  a needle for a channel
                   but found that  there wasn't supposed to be  a needle in
                   the buffer for that  channel.

              1C   While copying  a logical record  into a  history buffer,
                   the RMAKE  routine  discovered  that the  logical record
                   terminated with an isolated "00", "01", or "03" byte.

              1E   While copying  a logical record  into a  history buffer,
                   the RMAKE  routine  discovered  that the  logical record
                   was too short.

              20   While making up a logical record destined for a neighbor
                   that does not  support circuit rebuilds, the  RMAKE rou-
                   tine tried to discard an SQFIX control sequence.

              22   The RMAKE  routine found a zapper  in a buffer  that was
                   supposed to  contain a  needle, but  the buffer  was not
                   flagged by the CRQ routine as containing a needle.

              24   The RMAKE  routine discovered  a performance  monitoring
                   control character pair greater than "03-2B".

              2E   The RMAKE routine detected an  isolated "02" byte in the
                   data  while copying  a  logical  record into  a  history
                   buffer.

              30   The KERIN routine detected a buffer with data for a Ker-
                   nel port but found a permuter  table entry of 0 for that
                   port.

              32   The XHOSTS routine  detected an "03" control  code being
                   sent to the Kernel,  but it was not a gobbler  or a zap-
                   per.

              34   The XHOSTS  routine detected  an invalid  control record
                   sent by the Kernel.  It was not a gobbler or a zapper.

              36   The XHOSTS  routine detected  an invalid  acknowledgment
                   sent by the Kernel.  It was  not a gobbler, a zapper, or
                   a new login acknowledgment.

              38   While passing network data to the Supervisor, the XHOSTS
                   routine detected data on a channel  that had no entry in
                   the Supervisor permuter table.

              3A   While passing network data to the Supervisor, the XHOSTS
                   routine detected a zero-length record.

              3C   While passing network data to the Supervisor, the XHOSTS
                   routine detected a buffer with a positive logical record
                   count, but  the buffer's next-character-out  pointer was
                   set to zero.

              3E   While passing data to the  Dispatcher, the DISPI routine
                   detected data on a channel that had no entry in the Dis-
                   patcher permuter table.

              40   While receiving data from the Dispatcher, the DISPI rou-
                   tine detected data on a port  whose port number was out-
                   side the Dispatcher port range.

              42   While passing data from the Dispatcher into the network,
                   the DISPI  routine detected  an invalid  control message
                   type.

              44   While processing commands from the Dispatcher on channel
                   0, the DISPI routine detected an  invalid channel 0 con-
                   trol type.

              46   The DISPI  routine received  an invalid  control message
                   from the Dispatcher.

              48   While skipping over data from the Dispatcher on an unas-
                   signed port, the  DISPI routine detected a  control mes-
                   sage type that is out of range.

              4A   An invalid call  was made to the WCI  routine for buffer
                   number 0 or 1.

              4C   A  call was  made to  the  WCI routine  with an  invalid
                   buffer number.

              4E   While attempting to link the  bufferlet reserve tank (80
                   extra bufferlets)  to the bufferlet  free list,  the WRE
                   routine found  the reserve tank  empty.  This is  due to
                   insufficient bufferlet space.

              50   An invalid call  was made to the GCI  routine for buffer
                   number 0 or 1.

              52   A call was made to the CBCLR routine with a buffer index
                   number that was not a multiple of four.

              54   An call was  made to the CBCLR routine for  a buffer not
                   assigned to a channel.

              56   The byte  count of a history  buffer was less  than zero
                   because of excessive pruning of the history buffers.

              58   The CRQ routine detected an invalid history buffer index
                   in the list  of buffers containing  needles to  be proc-
                   essed.

              5A   The CRQ routine detected a value  other than "03" as the
                   first byte in a needle buffer.   It was expecting a nee-
                   dle point or a zapper.

              5C   The LEP routine  detected a rebuild request  reject from
                   the Supervisor, and the REBUILD option was disabled.

              5E   The INTHST routine received an invalid call.  This indi-
                   cates a possible hardware problem.

              60   The SUP14 routine received an invalid  call (not 0 or 4)
                   asking it to send an accounting  message to the Supervi-
                   sor.

              62   The CRQALT routine tried to add an invalid buffer number
                   to the needle buffer.

              64   While zapping the first half of  a circuit, an inconsis-
                   tency between  the buffer  flag and  the permuter  table
                   entry for that buffer flag was detected.

              66   While zapping the second half of a circuit, an inconsis-
                   tency between  the buffer  flag and  the permuter  table
                   entry for that buffer flag was detected.

              68   While zapping  the second  half of  a circuit,  the ZAPV
                   routine found that the complementary buffer flag was not
                   zero, indicating that the first  half of the circuit had
                   not been zapped.

              6A   While  attempting to  obtain  a  free buffer  pair,  the
                   GFCBUF routine detected that no more buffers were avail-
                   able.

              6C   While attempting to obtain a free buffer pair, the GCBUF
                   routine detected  that the  buffer index  linked to  the
                   buffer at the head of the free list was out of range.

              6E   While attempting to obtain a free buffer pair, the GCBUF
                   routine detected  that the  buffer index  linked to  the
                   buffer at the  head of the free list was  not a multiple
                   of four.

              70   The RFCBUF routine was called to return a buffer pair to
                   the free list, but the buffer index was out of range.

              72   While attempting to locate a free  port, the FNDCHN rou-
                   tine detected a permuter table entry  of 0, but the cor-
                   responding port in the active port array was not flagged
                   as available.

              74   While attempting  to locate a  free channel for  a link,
                   the FNDKNC  routine detected a  permuter table  entry of
                   zero,  but the  corresponding port  in  the active  port
                   array was not flagged as available.

              76   During a link bubble, an  inconsistency was detected for
                   a link channel that was shifted right to accommodate the
                   bubble.

              78   During a link bubble, the slave  node found an inconsis-
                   tency  between the  active port  array  and the  channel
                   serviced array for one of its links.

              7A   During a link bubble, an  inconsistency was detected for
                   a link channel that was  shifted left to accommodate the

              7C   The  compute byte  count (CBCT)  instruction computed  a
                   count of  zero for  a buffer  whose byte  count was  not
                   zero.

              7E   Data was received for  a port in login mode  on a stand-

              80   Data was received for  a port in login mode  on a stand-
                   alone TYMSAT, but the buffer index in the login permuter
                   table did not match the buffer index in the port table.

              82   An isolated "02"  byte was received for a  port in login
                   mode on a standalone TYMSAT.

              84   The ASYLOU  routine detected  an illegal  "03" character
                   pair  (03-00, 03-04  to 03-10,  or  greater than  03-14)
                   being sent to a port in login mode.

              86   An invalid "login-error" message was received for a port
                   on a standalone TYMSAT that was in login mode.

              88   An undefined "01" character pair was received for a TYM-
                   SAT port.

              8A   An invalid TYMSAT signal was  received from an asynchro-
                   nous port.

              8C   Data was  received for a port  in login mode,  but there
                   was no asynchronous port associated  with the login port
                   number.

              8E   While checking  for a signal  bound for the  TYMSAT, the
                   CPEEK routine  detected a  "01" control  character pair,
                   which is not a valid TYMSAT signal.

              90   After shrinking a  fat gobbler for storage  in a history
                   buffer,  the RMAKE  routine  detected  a logical  record
                   count of less than zero.

              92   The count of bufferlet bytes in use is less than zero.

              94   The count of history bufferlet bytes in use is less than
                   zero.


            CRASH CODE 64 - An empty buffer  or an illegal buffer index has
              been detected.  The value "aa" is a crash code extension that
              indicates one of the following conditions.

              aa   Meaning              __   _______

              02   The GCI routine was called to  obtain a character from a
                   buffer, but  the buffer  was empty  or the  buffer index
                   used was not a multiple of four.

            CRASH CODE 66 - An Illegal bufferlet free list pointer has been
              detected.   The value  "aa" is  a crash  code extension  that
              indicates one of the following conditions.

              aa   Meaning              __   _______

              02   While  attempting to  obtain  a  free buffer  pair,  the
                   GFCBUF routine detected  an invalid buffer index  in the
                   free list pointer.   The buffer was empty  or the buffer
                   index used was not a multiple of four.


            CRASH CODE 67 - SVC errors have  occurred.  The value "aa" is a
              crash code extension that indicates one of the following con-
              ditions.

              aa   Meaning              __   _______

              18   A "connect SIO" SVC was issued with an invalid line num-

              1E   A "query SIO status" SVC was issued with an invalid line
                   number.

              60   A "connect SYNC input or output"  SVC was issued with an
                   invalid line number  or an invalid input  buffer address
                   range.  This crash code  is also displayed if  a connec-
                   tion is attempted while one is already in progress.

              64   A "force  SYNC output"  SVC was  issued with  an invalid
                   line number.

              72   A "connect SIO" SVC was issued with an invalid line num-
                   ber,  an  invalid  register,  or  an  invalid  range  of
                   addresses.

              74   A "start SIO input" SVC was  issued with an invalid line
                   number, an invalid  register, or an invalid  CCW address

            This section contains PROBE system messages.


            ** FAST WRAPAROUND **   LOST PRINTOUT

            Sometimes  the Supervisor  generates log  messages faster  than
            PROBE can log them in real time.  The messages can be retrieved
            by typing "LOG time".  Note that  "time" should be a time prior
            to the time this message was output (see page 12).


            HOST host# NOT REPORTED BY nnnn

            This message indicates that the specified host is not currently
            on the specified node.  This message is a response to the PSTAT
            and the TRACE command.


            HOST host# PORT ARRAY nn OUT OF RANGE

            This message indicates that the specified  host does not have a
            port array  "nn".  Each  port array  contains 128  ports.  This
            message is a response to the PSTAT and the TRACE command.


            REQUEST REJECTED

            This message indicates  that a value specified in  a command is
            invalid or out of range.


            UNABLE TO SEND MESSAGE TO LOG

            This message indicates  that the common buffer used  to enter a
            message in  the log using the  ULOGA or ULOGH command  is busy,
            and the message cannot be sent.  Try again shortly.
