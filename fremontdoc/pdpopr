.PARA
^WITHIN THE ^D^E^CSYSTEM-10 SERIES, THE <KL-10
REPRESENTS A CONSIDERABLE HARDWARE DEPARTURE FROM THE CENTRAL
PROCESSOR CONFIGURATIONS OF THE EARLIER MODELS.
^ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THE <KL-10 IS THE <PDP-11
BASED ^CONSOLE/^DIAGNOSTIC FRONT END COMPUTER. 
<KLDCP RUNS IN THE <PDP-11 TO ALLOW SYSTEM CHECKING,
SETTING SENSE SWITCHES, ACCESSING STAND-ALONE UTILITIES
AND DIAGNOSING VARIOUS HARDWARE MALFUNCTIONS ON THE <KL-10.
.PARA
^THE INSTRUCTION SET FOR THE <KL-10 IS MICROPROGRAMMED, LOADED
BY THE <PDP-11 USING A <DECTAPE CHANNEL.
^AS THE MICRO-CODE IS FETCHED, IT SETS AND RESETS FLIP FLOPS AND
DATA PATHS WITHIN THE <KL-10.
^THIS ALLOWS THE POSSIBILITY OF USING MICROCODE TO ESTABLISH
A VARIETY OF POTENTIAL PROCESSOR INSTRUCTION SETS.
.PARA
<KL-10 <BOOTS (<KLDCP) IS LOADED THROUGH THE <PDP-11 <DECTAPE
EQUIPMENT.
^THE COMMAND FACILITIES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CONSOLE TERMINAL (<CTY)
PERMIT THE OPERATOR TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE <KL-10 THROUGH THE
<PDP-11, EXAMINE AND DEPOSIT INTO MEMORY LOCATIONS
AND MONITORS THE PROCESSOR.
.PARA
^THE <KL-10 MEMORY BUS ARCHITECTURE IS FOUR 36-BIT WORDS.
^THAT IS, THE <KL-10 CAN READ/WRITE FOUR WORDS FROM MEMORY
SIMULTANEOUSLY.
^THE <KL-10 ALSO FEATURES A HIGH-SPEED BUFFER MEMORY CALLED THE
^DATA ^CACHE.
^CACHE MAY BE VIEWED AS 2048 GENERAL PURPOSE FAST REGISTERS WHICH
SUBSTITUTE TEMPORARILY FOR THE MOST FREQUENTLY REFERENCED REAL
MEMORY LOCATIONS.
^DATA READ FROM MEMORY IS LIKELY TO BE FOUND ALREADY IN THE
CACHE, THUS REDUCING THE CORE CYCLE ACCESS TIME FOR CERTAIN
TYPES OF READS AND WRITES.
