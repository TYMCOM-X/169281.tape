1    INTRODUCTION
     

     The 'TAPELIB'  is a database  management system designed  to manage
the  information  on  all  Tymshare and  customer  tapes  within  all of
Tymshare's national computer centers.  Specifically, all  magnetic tapes
used  by  customers for  additional  and personal  off-line  storage are
indexed  and  administered  by this  program.   Tapes  used  by Tymshare
Operations for incremental backup or periodic 'All Files' dumps  are not
included in this system.

     The tape library may  be accessed from any  X, IX or 370  through a
satellite program.  That program  accesses the master software  and data
bases on the validations system (now C36).

     Except for  the 370's, you  may access the  tape library  under the
username you are logged in under.  On the 370's, you must attach  to the
username 'TAPELIB'.   If you do  not directly log  in to TAPELIB  on the
370's, you must make sure that TAPELIB's 191 mdisk is accessed as a read
only extention of  your 'A' disk.   The CP ATTACH  command automatically
insures this.  In addition, your 370 logged in username must have AUXLIC
license.

     Access to the the tape library on the IX's is obtained  by entering
'1TAPELIB',  on the  X's  by 'RUN  (UTIL)TAPELIB'  and on  the  370's by
'TAPELIB'.

     Several centers are  currently defined by  the CENTER data  base of
the tape library system:

   CUPA   Cupertino Bldg. A
   CUPC   Cupertino Bldg. C
   HOU    Houston Operations
   VF     Valley Forge Operations
   DA     Dallas Operations
   SF     San Francisco Operations
   PSC    Paris - Saint Cloud
   PP     Paris - Puteaux

     The IX's  and the X's  satellite programs begin  by asking  you for
your license username and password.  A check is made to insure  that you
are inhouse and  have the proper status.   Once you have  been accepted,
the program will build an  auxillary circuit to the tape  library system
and respond with the program prompt which is the colon (:).

     Commands may  be executed  at that time  depending upon  the status
obtained from the username-license sequence.  Users are flagged with the
following status: OPERATOR,  CUSTOMER SERVICES (C/S)  and/or ACCOUNTING.
You may have  any combination of  the mentioned status's.   Execution of
commands is dependent  upon your status.  A  short list of  the commands
and  a  quick  summary  of their  actions  follow.   Refer  to specified
explanations  in  the  COMMAND DESCRIPTION  section  to  determine which
commands are restricted to whom.

3    COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS
      

     Within this document, it will be assumed that 'TRP' will mean "Tape
Rack Position"  and that 'TID'  will mean "Tape  Identification number".
TRP'S will be  re-cycled as tapes are  released (a Trp is  available for
re-assignment 5  days after it  is freed) but  TID'S will  always remain
unique and never be re-cycled.  TID'S will be pulled from  a centralized
file, so it is  more than likely that  TID'S for a computer  center will
not be consecutive, but will be ascending.  All commands (except DUP and
REPORT TAPE TRP) request you to supply TID.

     It is very likely  that the TRP of a  tape may change from  time to
time.  therefore, to avoid confusion, it is necessary that operators and
users re-orient communications  about tapes in  the library to  focus on
TID rather that TRP.



3.1    ADD command
        

     This command is  restricted to operators  and C/S.  The  command is
used for entering a  tape to the library and  to receive a TRP  and TID.
The first thing you will be  prompted for is the username to  be charged
for storage of the tape in the library.  This username will be validated
to be current and the user's customer id, district and company name will
be obtained from the validation.

     The next prompt will be for the requestor-owner.  This is  the name
of  the  person who  requested  that the  tape  be entered  to  the tape
library.  Entry  is free  form, up to  15 characters  in length,  and is
terminated by a 'CR'.

     Next you will be prompted  for the ownership code of the  tape, for
which there are four: TR, TO, TP and CO.  TR stands for Tymshare Rented,
which is a tape owned by Tymshare, but used by the customer  for holding
his information.

     TO  stands for  Tymshare Owned  and is  a tape  used and  saved for
Tymshare personel.

     TP stands for Tape Purchased and is used on only the TYMCOM-370 for
enabling tape purchase charges in the accounting.

     CO stands for Customer Owned.  This code is for a tape  supplied by
the customer or purchased from Tymshare for the customers use.  The tape
is the property of the customer.

     You will  then be  asked the main  system where  the tape  is used.



                                   3



Operators may only specify a system which is located in the  center they
are running from.   For example, an operator  running from H32  may only
specify systems located in Houston.  Persons flagged with C/S status may
specify any system regardless of where they are logged in  from.  System
numbers are entered  as digits only.  Do  not include the  center prefix
code.

     If the system specified is a 370, you will be prompted to determine
if the tape is a 'REGULAR' or 'MINI'.

     Next you are prompted for  a tape description.  This is  free form,
up  to 40  characters and  is terminated  by a  'CR'.  If  the requestor
didn't  specify a  tape  description, the  project code  from  the batch
request calling for that tape should be used.

     Last,  you  will be  prompted  for other  usernames  which  will be
allowed access to the tape.  This information should be supplied  by the
requestor of the tape.  The username entered in the beginning of the add
command is  already assumed, so  it should not  be re-entered.   You may
enter, one at a time, usernames that will have access to the tape.  Each
entry is terminated by a 'CR'.  Each name will be validated and added to
an access list.  Should a group of people wish to be validated, an entry
may be  made such  as 'GAN=NNNNNN'  where 'NNNNNNN'  will be  the Global
Account Number of the group.   Also, if no restrictions are to  be made,
an  entry  line  'GAN=ALL'  is also  allowed.   In  addition,  the entry
'ANY=R/O' indicates that all users have access to the tape in  read only
mode (no write  ring).  Access entries are  unlimited, entered one  at a
time and  terminated by a  'CR'.  to terminate  the access  list, simply
respond with a 'CR' when asked for the next access username.

     When the  access list  has been  terminated, a  label is  typed out
which should be attached to the tape.  This label will contain  the TRP,
TID, requestor-owner, access list, center, system, district no., date of
entry to tape library and tape description.

     At  the same  time, a  label with  the same  information, but  in a
crescent label  format will be  appended to a  file in (TAPEDIR)  on the
validations system.  The file name  will be the same as the  center name
(i.e.   HOU, CUPA)  and the  extension will  be 'LBL'.   It will  be the
responsibility of  Operations to print  this file on  the labels  and to
delete it when completed.

     Upon completion, the tape will be given active status (A).



3.2    CHANGE command
        

     This command  is reserved  for Operators and  C/S.  The  command is
used for changing various key information about the tape.

     The program will begin by prompting you for the TID of the  tape to
be changed.  The  program will then  display information about  the tape



                                   4



with that TRP  and ask you to  verify that it has  the tape you  wish to
change.

     Upon finding the correct record,  you will be asked to  specify the
item you wish to change.  The items that can be changed are numbered and
you must specify  one of these numbers.   After an item number  has been
specified, you will  be prompted for  the correct information.   Data is
entered in the same format and with the same restrictions as  when using
the 'ADD' command.

     Once  the program  has received  the new  information, you  will be
asked if the entry is correct with an 'OK?' query.  A 'NO' response will
cause the entry to be rejected while a 'YES' will cause the the  data to
be accepted.

     After a  change has been  made, you  will be asked  if you  wish to
change another item  in the tape record.   A 'YES' response  will return
you to  answering which item  you wish to  change while a  'NO' response
will  terminate the  change session  and cause  a new  tape label  to be
printed to yous terminal.

     Please note that  when changing the  'USER' username, you  are also
changing  the customer  id., you's  district and  possibly,  the billing
responsibility for the tape.

     Also, the system  change can only reflect  a system located  in the
center of which the tape is assigned.  To change to a system outside the
center, the 'TRANSFER' command must be used.



3.3    RELEASE command
        

     This command  is used  for the releasing  of a  tape from  the tape
library.   Operators can  only  release tapes  for the  center  they are
logged in through.

     The program will type  out all relevent information about  the tape
and ask you to verify that the library has the correct tape  to release.
Upon locating the  correct tape to release,  the user will be  asked the
disposition of the tape upon  release, such as, 'SCRATCH' or  'SEND BACK
TO OWNER'.  Data is entered free form with up to 25 characters accepted.
Data  is  terminated  with a  'CR'.   You  will also  be  asked  for the
pertinent batch request number and name of the person requesting release
of  the tape.   Until the  record  is purged  from the  library  via the
'BILLING' command,  the tape  will remain in  the library  with released
status (R).









                                   5



3.4    TRANSFER command
        

     This command reserved for  Operators and C/S.  The command  is used
to transfer a tape from one center to another.

     You will be prompted for  the transfer center and the tape  will be
marked as being in a transfer state (T).  Except for C/S,  Operators may
only transfer tapes from their own center.

     Even though a  tape has been put  in transfer, the tape  will still
belong  to  the transfering  center:  only they  can  report,  change or
release the tape.  The receiving  center can not have any access  to the
tape until they have accepted the tape with the 'ACCEPT' command.

     Should the  transferring center later  decide that the  tape should
not be transfered, they may  remove the tape from its transfer  state by
doing  another  'TRANSFER' on  the  tape back  to  the  original center.
However, this can only be done before the receiving center  has accepted
the tape.

     The TRP of the tape is not released until the receiving  center has
accepted the tape.



3.5    ACCEPT command
        

     Reserved  for  Operators only.   This  command will  accept  a tape
transfered to the Operator's computer center.

     The Operator may find out which requests are waiting  acceptance by
issuing the 'REPORT TRANSFER' command.

     Upon acceptance of the TID,  the Operator is asked what  the system
of main use  will be.  The system  will be validated for  the Operator's
center.   Upon acceptance  of  the system,  the  tapes old  TRP  will be
released to the sending center and a new TRP will be assigned.   The TID
will  remain the  same.  A  new tape  label will  also be  typed  to the
terminal.



3.6    DUPLICATE command
        

     Reserved for Operator and C/S.   The purpose of this command  is to
generate a  label of the  same type created  when the 'ADD'  command was
used.









                                   6



3.7    REPORT command
        

     Reserved  for  Operators  and  C/S.   This  command  is   used  for
generating  reports on  tapes  in the  tape  library.  In  all  types of
reports available, output may be directed to yous terminal or to  a disk
file.  Disk files are always created under the username of  (TAPEDIR) on
the validations system.  When asked where the output is to  be directed,
you may  specify 'TTY, 'TERMINAL',  'TELETYPE' or the  name of  the disk
file.  Disk file  names may not include  (username) since the  file will
always be created under 'TAPEDIR'.  File names may only use  the letters
a-z and the numbers 0-9 and must be in Tymcom-X format.

     In  the 'REPORT  USERNAME', 'REPORT  CUSID', 'REPORT  TRP'  and the
'REPORT  TID'  you will  be  asked if  you  want the  report  to include
released tapes.  You may reply 'ALL' or 'ACTIVE'.  'ALL' will signify to
include  released tapes  while 'ACTIVE'  will only  include  those tapes
which are active.  For all other REPORT commands, only active tapes will
be shown.

REPORT TID 'TID'

     This command is for  reporting on an individual tape  identified by
the tape TID.  All tapes with the specified TID will be shown.   You may
also specify the word 'ALL' for the TID in which case a report  for yous
center  will be  created for  all  tapes sorted  by TID.   You  may also
fy if you want released tapes included in the report output.

REPORT TRP 'TRP'

     This command is for  reporting on an individual tape  identified by
the TRP number.   Only tapes from you's  center will be shown.   You may
also specify if you want released tapes included with this report.

REPORT SYSTEM 'SYSTEM NO'

     Use this command to generate  a report on all tapes  used primarily
on the system specified.  Output will be sorted numerically by TRP.

REPORT CENTER 'CENTER'

     This generates a report on all tapes in the library for  the center
specified.   Output should  be kept  recent as  a directory  of customer
tapes for the center.  It is sorted by TRP.

REPORT ALL

     With OPERATOR status this command will default to the REPORT CENTER
command.  For C/S status, all  centers in the library will  be reported.
In this case, output will be sorted by center and TRP.

REPORT DISTRICT 'NO.'

     You may specifiy  an individual district  or the word  'ALL'.  When
'ALL' is used, districts will be sorted numerically by district number.


                                   7



REPORT USER 'USERNAME'

     This generates a  report on all tapes  in the library  belonging to
the specified username.  Use  this command to facilitate  tape searches.
You may  also specify  if you want  the released  tapes included  in the
report output.

REPORT CUSTOMER 'CUSID'

     Given the  Customer ID.,  a report will  be generated  containing a
list of all tapes belonging  to the specified customer.  Output  will be
sorted on center, system and username.  You may also specify if you want
released tapes included in the report output.

REPORT TRANSFER

     When you  first run the  tape library,  a check is  made to  see if
there are any tapes that  have been transfered to your site.   A message
will  appear if  there are  any.   This command  gives a  report  to the
terminal listing all tapes that are in a transfer state to yous computer
center.  It is recommended that the Operator issue this command prior to
doing the 'ACCEPT' command.



3.8    HISTORY command
        

     Restricted  to  Operator  and C/S.   This  command  is  for getting
information about a released tape.  It is keyed by the TID.  Information
supplied will be the TRP, TID, owner, company, district, center, system,
date of release,  the batch request  requesting the release,  the person
requesting the release, the destination of the tape upon release and the
name of the Operator that released the tape.



3.9    MAP command
        

     This command is used for referencing the system-center map  kept by
the tape library.  The center-system map is a map of all  systems, their
type and to what center they belong.



3.10    SLOTS command
         

     This command outputs a list of all trp's in a specific library that

     Reserved for accounting only.

     Each  record in  the library  will be  examined.  If  60  days have
elapsed since a tape has  been released, the tape record will  be purged
from the tape library, otherwise it will be entered into  the accounting
file.

     Records  that  have not  been  released will  be  validated  by the
username assigned to the tape.  If the usernames customer id., district,
gan, or uun have been changed, updates will be made to the tape library.
If  the username  has changed,  a correction  is made  as well.   If the
username  has become  invalid, an  error is  recorded.  The  record will
still be entered to the accounting file.

     The accounting file is  created under (*1BATCH) on  the validations
system with a file name of TAPES.DAT.

     If there are any problems with the building of circuits from you to
the TAPLIB database  system, a message will  output to this  effect from
both TAPLIB  and the  network.  Most likely  the data  base will  not be
harmed by net problems while TAPLIB is running.  Login and  restart what
you were doing.  Also, you will  not be able to run this program  if the
validations system is unavailable.

     If  you see  the  error message  '1022  ERROR LLNN'  (where  LL are
letters and NN are numbers)  you should quit the program and  report the
errors to your supervisor.   The SYSTEMS RESOURCE ALLOCATION  group must
be notified of all these types of errors as soon as possible.

     Upon completion of the  accounting run, which is suspected  to last
several hours, if any usernames have been found to be in-valid, an error
file is created under user  'SRA' on the validations system with  a file
name of TAPES.ERR.  Mail will also be sent to 'SRA' telling of the error
file.  In the case  that mail cannot be  sent, an error message  will be
sent to yous terminal telling of the error condition and to notify S.R.A
immediateley.

     If the 370 satellite program ever outputs the error 'RETURN  CODE 1
ON RDBUF ACTGSYS DATA A1'  then the file 'ACTGSYS DATA' has  either been
erased or cannot be read.  The file resides on TAPELIB's 191  mdisk.  It
is allright to telecopy the file from another host.

     The  Systems Resource  Allocation group  is in  Cupertino,  and the
telephone number is (408) 446-6315.
