                                     ----
       ((INTRODUCTION))

            TITO was developed to provide an improved utility for magnetic tape
       work on the TYMCOM-X systems.  TITO can read TEX format tapes but it may
       have trouble reading the older 'FAILSA' format (FAILSAFE  is  documented
       elsewhere).    TITO   cannot  perform  any  'magnetic  tape  conversion'
       functions nor handle tapes from anywhere else but the TYMCOM-X systems.

            In addition, TITO allows the  operator  to  verify  that  checksums
       agree  -  a certain method of assuring that none of the file has changed
       during the transfer to or from tape.  TITO  allows  storing  of  a  file
       across the physical tape boundary and has the ability to continue a tape
       job on a different tape device than the one initially  assigned  to  the
       job.   It  allows  more  selectivity  in determining which files will be
       operated upon for selected commands, and how much detail to type out  on
       the  operator's  terminal  for tape to disk and disk to tape procedures.
       TITO is better able to recover from certain common  tape  format  errors
       than   earlier   tape  utilities.   Finally,  the  program  will  accept
       previously created indirect or command file  inputs.   Use  of  indirect
       files,  carefully  created,  is  a technique that can save much time for
       experienced operators.

TITO


       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))

            The program will prompt for a device name which must be of the form
       FTAN  (Fast TApe) where N is a drive number.  Next the program will type
       the tracks and density available for that device.  When using a 9  track
       drive (on most PDP-10 tape jobs), then a density of 1600 or 6250 bpi can
       be used.  The default density should be 6250.  For each job,  TITO  will
       also  supply  a  device name which will appear on any directory listings
       for files written on the tape.  This feature can  be  used  1)  to  tell
       where the file was written;  (2) to read files written on a badly skewed
       drive;  (3) to indicate that a particular tape  drive  is  compatibility
       error prone and should be written up for NOVADYNE (FSC) to check out.

            All TITO commands and keyword modifiers may be abbreviated  to  the
       mininum  number  of  characters required to make the the command unique.
       For example, DIRECTORY  may  be  abbreviated  "DI"  and  DEVICE  may  be
       abbreviated   "DE".   TITO  will  always  inform  the  operator  if  the
       abbreviation is not unique, for example, the ambiguous abbreviation "D".

            The HELP command lists in summary form the program commands and the
       purpose  of  each.   In  addition,  Help may be typed in the middle of a
       multipart command to obtain the options that apply.

                             COMMAND FORMAT PARTS
                             --------------------

            The most often used commands in TITO are STORE,  RESTORE,  GET  and
       DIRECTORY.   There  are three general parts to TITO command format:  the
       verb, the object and the modifier.  STORE uses  all  three  parts  while
       RESTORE, GET and DIRECTORY use the first two parts.

                                      1.
       The first part of  each  command  is  the  verb  (STORE,  RESTORE,  GET,
       DIRECTORY).

          STORE  is  used  to  write  files   on   tape   and   requires   tape
          initialization.   It  is  used for customer tapes, backups, all files
          and transfers.

          RESTORE retrieves files from tape and places them in  their  original
          directories, unless some form of translation is used.

          GET functions the same as restore, except that  the  tape  files  are
          written  to  the TITO user's directory.  This in effect, is usually a
          translation from any tape user into directory (OPER) on disk.

          DIRECTORY is used to create a listing of file names  and  other  info
          from  a  specified  magtape.   Unless some form of the COF command is
          used, the tape directory will output on the terminal.

TITO


                                      2.
       The second part of each command is the object.  This may be:

          (1) A list of global account numbers preceded by  "G",  e.g.   G1  or
          G1-4 or G1,4,6;

          (2) A list of usernames, e.g.  (SYS), (OPER) or a list of PPN'S  e.g.
          [1,1],[1,4];

          (3) A  list  of  filenames  preceded  by  a  username  or  PPN,  e.g.
          (OPER)A.X,B.X,C.X or [1,4]A.X,B.X,C.X;

          (4) The directive "ALL" preceded by a  username  to  select  all  the
          files  belonging  to  a user, or not preceded by a username to select
          all files belonging to all users;  

          (5) A list of file positions preceded by 'P' or '#', e.g.  #1,3-5,14;

          (6) An indirect file preceded by an '@' sign.


                                         NOTE

           Position numbers are not meaningful to the STORE command.


            Filenames, except for that of an indirect file,  may  contain  wild
       card  characters  "#"  or  "?"  to  match  any filename character, or an
       asterisk in the name or extension portion of the filename (or  both)  to
       match all names or extensions (or both).

TITO


                                      3.
       The third part of the command is a modifier to the second part.  A STORE
       command  may  have  more than one modifier.  The following modifiers are
       available:  TWICE, THRICE, CREATED AFTER, CHANGED,  and  STARTING  WITH.
       The  TWICE,  THRICE  CREATED AFTER, and CHANGED modifiers are meaningful
       only to STORE.

          The TWICE modifier causes TITO to write two savesets instead  of  one
          in the STORE command.

          The THRICE modifier causes TITO to write three  savesets  instead  of
          one in the STORE command.

          The CREATED AFTER modifier takes as its object a  date  expressed  as
          HH:MM DD MON YR, where HH:MM is the time in hours and minutes, and DD
          MON YR is the day-month-year.  Files to be stored are  restricted  to
          those  created  after the specified time and date.  The time and date
          may be abbreviated:  If only HH:MM is given, the date defaults to the
          current day-month-year;  if only HH:MM DD is given, the date defaults
          to the current month-year;  if only HH:MM DD MON is given,  the  date
          defaults to the current year.

          The CHANGED modifier takes no object and  specifies  that  all  files
          which  have  the  "file  changed"  bit on in will be written to tape.
          Note that the "file changed" bit can be turned off only by  a  "STORE
          ALL  CHANGED"  operation (the daily backup).  The CHANGED modifier is
          specifying files which have changed since the last backup operation.

          The STARTING WITH modifier takes username or filename  as  an  object
          and  begins the current operation (STORE, RESTORE, GET, DIRECTORY) at
          the specified user or filename.  In the case of files  split  between
          tapes,  the  program will report the filename followed by page number
          and partial checksum enclosed in angle brackets "<>".   If  the  file
          split  should fail, you should restart the store manually on the next
          tape, using this modifier to store the entire file on the next tape.


                                          NOTE

              The user has the option of setting a 'NO FAILSA' bit  in  the
              UFD which will exempt the entire directory from all files and
              backup stores.  The program which allows this option, DMPUFD,
              will  cause  a  TITO  message  "USERNAME XXXX IGNORED".  This
              option  is   usually   only   applied   to   certain   MAGNUM
              applications.

TITO


                         INITIALIZATION FOR STORE JOBS
                         -----------------------------

            With the  exception  of  the  CUT  AFTER  command,  which  requires
       confirmation,  and  is not recommended except as a 'last resort', a tape
       may not be written on until it has  been  initialized.   There  are  two
       methods  provided  for  initializing  tape.   These are (a) the NEW TAPE
       command;  (b) the APPEND command.

          The NEW TAPE command rewinds the tape to load point so that the  next
          STORE command will begin with SAVESET NO.  1, FILE NUMBER 1.

          The APPEND command spaces the tape out to the logical  end  of  tape.
          Unless  TITO is certain that the tape is positioned at logical end of
          tape, a rewind is automatically issued first.

                     TRANSLATION OF USERNAMES FOR RESTORES
                     -------------------------------------

               Frequently it is necessary to restore files to a  user  on  disc
          which  differs  from the user on tape.  The GET command does this for
          one user (restoring  files  to  username  running  TITO),  but  often
          several  usernames  are  involved  and  the  restore  destination  is
          different from the username running  TITO.   For  this  function  the
          TRANSLATION  command is used.  It sets up a table of destination user
          names and prior to restoring, TITO substitutes the  username  in  the
          translation table for the username on tape.


                                          NOTE

              All usernames not referenced by this translation  table  will
              be skipped during subsequent TITO commands.  Also, TEX format
              tapes which do not use usernames will also be skipped.  It is
              recommended  you  set  MODE  RESTORE  FILES (described later)
              whenever you TRANSLATE.



          The translation table may be set up by using  the  TRANSLATE  command
          and  then entering the disc username and tape username seperated by a
          back arrow or underscore character.

          Alternately, disk/tape username pairs may be included as part of  the
          RESTORE  or  GET command strings.  For example, the following command
          is presented:  

          "*"RES (MARTINEZ)(TRAINING)TAPE.DOC.

       The translation table is automatically cleared after the  command  using
       it has executed.

TITO


                               THE MODE COMMAND
                               ----------------

            The MODE command concerns two different aspects  of  TITO  options:
       The  first  set of options pertains to what TITO should do if it finds a
       file with a name and extension string on disk which could be overwritten
       during  a  RESTORE  or  GET  command  by  a  file  on tape with the same
       filename/extension;  The second use of the MODE command deals with  what
       extent of information should be output by TITO during a STORE or RESTORE
       operation.  This second set of options is involved in quality  assurance
       techniques.

            The MODE command has three parts.  The command  portion  is  always
       MODE.   If this command is followed by only a carriage return, TITO will
       type out the current mode setting.  When specifying  overwrite  setting,
       the  second  part  or  object  may be either OLD or SYS.  The object OLD
       indicates all files except those in directory (SYS) which exist on  both
       disc  and  tape, with the disc file about to be overwritten by a RESTORE
       or GET operation.  An object of SYS indicates files  in  username  (SYS)
       which are very critical to the operating system and thus have a separate
       MODE string to protect them against being overwritten unintentionally.

            The third part of this  command  string,  the  modifier,  indicates
       which  copy  of  the  file  to keep should the file about to be restored
       exist on both tape and disc.  Options at this point  are  NEWEST,  DISC,
       TAPE, and CONFIRM.

          NEWEST selects the most recent file, as determined  by  the  creation
          date of the tape and disc files.

          DISC keeps the disc version of  the  file.   TITO  will  typeout  the
          message "NOT WRITING OVER FILE ...".

          TAPE replaces the disc version with the tape version in all cases.

          CONFIRM is the default mode and requires that  the  operator  confirm
          before any disc file is overwritten by a tape file.

            Regarding the other set of MODE options  concerning  TITO  typeout,
       the  second  part  of the command string may be eithORE or RESTORE.
       In this case, the modifier will be used to specify what is to be printed
       on  the  operator's  terminal during the operation.  The listing options
       are TOTALS, USERS, or FILES.

          TOTALS prints only the grand totals for  the  operation,  e.g.   "NNN
          FILES PROCESSED."

          USERS prints totals for each user along with grand totals.   This  is
          the default mode.

          FILES prints each filename as it is  read/written  from  or  to  tape
          along  with the user totals and the grand total.  This should be used
          during batch restore and store jobs.

                             THE DIRECTORY COMMAND
                             ---------------------

            TITO features an expanded tape directory which is 86 columns  wide.
       In  addition,  each  saveset  header record printout includes the system
       identification, the tape device number, and the density  and  number  of
       tracks recorded.

       The directory output format is given below.

                 COLUMNS         CONTENTS
                 -------         --------

                  00-05          FILE POSITION NO. IN OCTAL

                  06-08          TAPE NO. IN SAVESET (1,2,3,...)

                  12-17          FILENAME

                  19-21          FILENAME EXTENSION

                  27-38          USERNAME

                  41-45          CREATION TIME

                  47-55          CREATION DATE

                  58-62          TIME TAPE WRITTEN

                  79-84          CHECKSUM

            Column headings are printed for each user, and the PPN for the user
       is printed in the same line as total user files in columns 41-55.  Total
       pages allocated to a user is printed in columns 72-77 of the same line.

                             THE CUT AFTER COMMAND
                             ---------------------

            The CUT AFTER command takes the form CUT AFTER FILENAME and can  be
       used  to  redefine logical End Of Tape (EOT).  It positions the tape out
       after the specified filename and writes a dummy saveset  trailer  record
       and  two  filemarks.   The  tape  is  then  positioned  between  the two
       filemarks with the logical EOT flag set, so that an APPEND at this point
       initializes the tape for writing without moving the tape.

            Since CUT AFTER is a very dangerous command, the following approach
       should  be  understood  to  avoid  losing  tape files due to positioning
       errors.

                           BACKUP AND ALL-FILE TAPES
                           -------------------------

            Don't use the "CUT AFTER" command to fix  an  aborted  "BACKUP"  or
       "ALL-FILE"  tape.   Run a full directory to the line printer;  determine
       the last "GOOD" tape position;  and, write  the  information  about  the
       last  good  tape position on the directory.  Use another tape to restart
       the "BACKUP" or "ALL-FILE", starting with  the  last  full  user  stored
       before the previous tape aborted.  

                                CUSTOMER TAPES
                                --------------

            When a customer tape aborts and doesn't have a logical "EOT" it  is
       necessary  to  use the "CUT AFTER" command.  First, run a full directory
       of the tape to the line printer  and  determine  the  last  "GOOD"  tape
       position.   Don't  use  the  "WHERE"  command  to determine correct tape
       position (it is UNTRUSTWORTHY).  Before using the "CUT  AFTER"  command,
       make  sure  the  tape  is  rewound  using "RWNW" and then issue the "CUT
       AFTER" command.  Be very careful that the correct  file  name  and  tape
       position  are correct before confirming the "CUT AFTER" command.  (Refer
       to "CONTINUING ON MULTIPLE TAPES" paragraph).

            There may be a noticeable delay between the  time  the  command  is
       given and the time the program asks for the tape pos.  range.  The delay
       is the time it takes TITO to locate a file header record on tape.


                                         NOTE

           See RESTARTING ALLFILES AND DAILY BACKUPS section for examples.

                              THE DEVICE COMMAND
                              ------------------

            The DEVICE command can be used to change the tape drives  or  drive
       density setting without quiting from TITO.  It has the form

                 DEVICE DEVNAME DENSITY(CR)

       where DEVNAME and DENSITY are optional.   If  DEVNAME  is  missing,  the
       current  device is implied;  if DEVNAME is present, TITO attempts to use
       this device.  If DENSITY is missing, the command merely prints all known
       characteristics  of the device (or interrogates the operator for them if
       the device is a new one unknown to TITO).  If DENSITY is  present,  then
       TITO  will attempt to set that density and ask for it to be reentered if
       the device is incapable of this density setting.

                            MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS
                            ----------------------

            The WHERE command prints the last tape position number  read.   The
       tape  will  probably  be  positioned  a  few  records past this position
       number.  TITO prints "position unknown" if the current  position  number
       is  meaningless.   Another way to get your current position number is to
       type 'W(cr)' when prompted for tape position range during the RESTORE or
       GET  commands.   Be  advised  this command is somewhat untrustworthy and
       should not be used for determining tape position for CUT AFTER input.

            The COF command Changes  the  Output  File  from  terminal  to  the
       specified  device  until  changed by another COF command.  These devices
       are valid objects for the COF command:  PRinter, TERminal, TELetype, and
       a  filename  in  the directory of the operator running the TITO program.
       Use a form of 'COF FILENA.ME' if it is necessary  to  obtain  an  online
       copy  of  a tape directory or if the line printer is unavailable at that
       time.

       RESTARTING ALLFILES AND DAILY BACKUPS
       -------------------------------------

       When running ALLFILES or DAILY backup, and for some reason  the  job  is
       aborted,  (i.   e.  System Crash, NETWORK, Power Failure, etc) there are
       two ways of restarting the job.

       The first is to use the CUT AFTER COMMAND.  This command  is  used  when
       the  last file stored is somewhere between the middle or near the end of
       the tape.

       The second command is STORE  ALL  STARTING  WITH  <BLOCK>  and  <PARTIAL
       CKSUM>.  This command would be used when the last file stored on tape is
       close to the beginning of the tape.  To be able to use this command, the
       STORE would have to be on the SECOND REEL or beyond.

       IF MAY BE POSSIBLE TO SAVE SOME FILES FROM THE PREVIOUS SAVE  SET  ALSO.
       IF  THE  PREVIOUS  SAVE  SET  IS  A  DUPLICATE  OF  THE  ONE THE TAPE IS

                           ((ERRORS AND RECOVERIES))

            TITO output messages are normally directed to the terminal  running
       the  program;   however the 'COF' (change output file) can cause them to
       be duplicated elsewhere.   The  error  messages  listed  below  will  be
       directed  to  the controlling terminal regardless of any COF switch.  Be
       sure to check for any messages of the format 'FILE (FILENAME) NOT  GIVEN
       LICENSE  XXXXXXXXX'.   In some cases this can result in important system
       jobs not being able to run.  Be sure to  check  all  output  if  a  disk
       rebuild or refresh is being done.  Here are the TITO error messages:

       The following is a list of most common errors that  Operators  will  see
       while  running  TITO.   Operators should pay close attention to them and
       corrective action should be taken, if known, where applicable.  In  this
       regard,  don't  try  to correct a problem if you are not sure of what to
       do.  All UNKNOWN CORRECTIVE ACTION should be brought to the attention of
       your  Shift  Supervisor.   If  the  Shift  Supervisor  cannot  solve the
       problem, then it is to be esculated.

       Hardcopy is needed at all times if it has to be researched.

       Some of the most common messages that Operators will see are:

               A.  FILE NOT DUMPED (USERNAME)FILENAME, MARKED TO NOT
                   DUMP.

                   NO ACTION REQUIRED.

               B.  UNABLE TO MARK FILE (USERNAME)FILENAME AS DUMPED.

                   FILE MAY BE OPENED.  SHOULD BE PICKED UP ON NEXT
                   BACKUP.  NO ACTION REQUIRED.

               C.  NEW FILE (USERNAME)FILENAME NOT MARKED AS DUMPED.

                   USER IS EDITING FILE.  WILL BE PICKUP UP ON NEXT

               D.  UNABLE TO DO LOOKUP ON FILE (USERNAME)FILENAME.
                   CONTINUING WITH NEXT FILE.

                   IF THIS KEEPS PRINTING OUT ON A SINGLE, OR MULTIPLE
                   USERNAME, THERE COULD BE A HARDWARE PROBLEM.  GET OUT
                   OF TITO AND START CHECKING THE HARDWARE.  LOOK FOR
                   CHECKED OUT BE NOVADYNE (FSC).  AFTER THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED,
                   PUT THE TAPE INVOLVED BACK ON THE TAPE DRIVE AND
                   MAKE A DIRECTORY OF TAPE.  USING THE DIRECTORY,
                   WRITE AN EOT MARK AFTER THE LAST GOOD POSITION.
                   PUT THIS TAPE ASIDE, AND MOUNT THE NEXT TAPE AND
                   START WITH THE NEXT USERNAME.

               E.  FILE NOT DUMPED (USERNAME)FILENAME, MARKED BAD ON TAPE.

                   THIS MEANS THE FILE MAY HAVE A HARDWARE DATA
                   READ/WRITE ERROR, OR HAS BEEN FOUND BAD BY DAMAGE
                   ASSESSMENT PROGRAM.  NO ACTION IS REQUIRED, BUT
                   HARDCOPY SHOULD BE SAVED AND SENT TO THE SHIFT
                   SUPERVISOR.

               F.  AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF HUNG DEVICE ERRORS SHOULD
                   BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF NOVADYNE (FSC).  THIS COULD
                   BE A HARDWARE PROBLEM.  OPERATORS ARE TO WRITE AN

                                 WRITE ERRORS
                                 ------------

            If TITO fails to store across tape boundaries, it will  provide  an
       error  message  explaining  why.   The  STORE  job  should  be restarted
       manually on the next tape using the 'START WITH FILENAME' modifier.

            In general, when tape write errors occur, you will be asked if  you
       wish to continue with the job.  If the answer is NO, an end of file mark
       will be written and TITO will return to command level;   if  you  answer
       YES,  the EOF will be written and the file will be stored on tape again.
       This means that the file in question  will  appear  twice  on  the  tape
       directory,  with  the  first  copy  showing  a  bad checksum.  On a disk
       rebuild the latter copy will be restored on top of the earlier bad  copy
       but  on  other restore jobs you should be careful not to restore the bad
       copy of the file from the tape (e.g.  with the MODE OLD NEW option).

            Whether or not you should answer  'YES'  to  continue  after  write
       errors occur depends on what kind of tape is being written:

            If the tape is a customer tape:  answer 'NO' and rewind  the  tape.
       Try  cleaning  the  tape  drive.   You might try removing the write ring
       (this is very important!) and cleaning the tape.  Next run  a  directory
       of  the  last  few  positions on the tape to verify the condition of the
       tape.  It is important to notify your lead operator or shift manager  if
       you  have  a  verified  problem with a customer tape.  Then it is a good
       idea to use the 'get' command to copy the last good  file  then  try  to
       redo  the  store  again  using  the cut command if appropriate.  If this
       fails for some reason you still have a good copy of the  file.   If  you
       cannot  store  the files without getting write errors it is necessary to
       rebuild the tape.  Remember to remove the write ring from  the  original
       tape  before  you  start.  A tape rebuild usually involves restoring all
       possible files from the tape to a holding  directory  then  storing  the
       files  back  out  to a new tape.  Do not return the bad tape to the tape
       library if you have encountered unrecoverable  write  errors.   Instead,
       nofify  your  supervisor of what was done.  You should provide them with
       the original bad tape.

            If the tape is a backup or all files tape:   Answer  NO  when  TITO
       asks  if  you want to continue after write errors.  Clean the tape drive
       and possibly the tape (write ring out for  this).   If  the  hard  write
       errors continue after doing the above, answer NO a second time and get a
       new tape before continuing from where the store left  off.   It  is  not
       necessary to rebuild an all files or backup tape but it should be marked
       clearly as a bad tape and removed from the set for recycle.  Leave it in
       the tape library so it can be evaluated on the tape cleaning machine.

            If the tape is a scratch tape being used to transfer files:  answer
       YES  and  continue  with  the store.  The bad file will be rewritten but
       when the job is all done, send the suspected bad tape to the evaluator.

                            SAVING A FILE STRUCTURE
                            -----------------------

       OVERVIEW       ________

            A.  ASP (Absolute Structure Save and Restore Program) is a  utility
       which  allows  an entire file structure to be saved to and restored from
       magnetic tape.  Whereas file to tape save and restore programs like TITO
       save  each  file  individually, ASP saves all the pages on the structure
       sequentially.   Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  save  or  restore
       individual files with ASP.

            B.  The usefulness of ASP lies in the fact that it is  much  faster
       to  save  a  file  structure  page by page than to save it file by file.
       TITO takes from one to two hours per reel of tape, depending on the size
       of  the  files  that  are being saved.  ASP takes eleven (11) minutes to
       write one reel of tape at 6250 BPI, regardless of the state of the  file
       structure.

            C.  Since ASP runs as the ONLY JOB on the system (if  it  did  not,
       the  file  structure  would  not  be in a stable state to have its image
       saved) there is no synchronization problem between files -  since  there
       are no other jobs, all files are saved in a stable state.

            D.  The format of an ASP tape has been designed  to  minimize  both
       human  and  machine  error in the SAVE/RESTORE.  Each tape has the exact
       date and time it was written, so that it is impossible to try to restore
       tapes  from different save to a structure.  Each data record is followed
       by a small epilogue record containing a checking code and record  serial
       number  with respect to all tapes in the set.  This allows recovery from
       tape errors (although at the expense of losing data).

            E.  The format of an ASP tape consists of  a  HEADER,  followed  by
       <data  record><prologue record> pairs.  The prologue record contains the
       GMT time of day that the HEADER was written.

       PREPARATION BEFORE ASP DUMP       ___________ ______ ___ ____

            Before starting TAKEIT make sure SSW4 is set and run a SYSTAT DISK.
       Save the SYSTAT DISK output for NOVADYNE (FSC).

           '!'R ERRCHK (CR)

           '*'ERR HARD BPA SENSE (CR)

           'EXIT'

           '!'

       Enter the PSCHED letter.

            Now is the time to check to make sure  you  have  the  correct  ASP
       tapes  for  the  system  and  that  ALL labels and straps are identified
       correctly and dated the date the ASP dump is taken.

       TAKING SYSTEM DOWN       ______ ______ ____

            After performing all of the above, the system  can  be  taken  down
       using these procedures:

           1.  Run TAKEIT with BOOTS-LOADED option.

           2.  After the system is down at BOOTS:, press
               carriage return to load the current running SYSTEM.SAV.


                                         NOTE

           If system is suppose to be up on NEWMON,  enter  NEWMON  at  the
           BOOTS:  prompt and then press carriage return.


           3.  After the monitor has loaded, the system is at ONCE> dialogue
               mode.  (Be careful while in this mode).

           4.  At the ONCE> prompt, enter CONSOLE and a carriage return.

           5.  At the next ONCE> prompt, enter READONLY (CR).

           6.  Do a CTRL-Z L and type in OPER and a carriage return.
               (CTRL-Z, L, and OPER will not output to CTY/TTY).

       ERRORS AND RECOVERIES       ______ ___ __________

            A.  OUTPUT ERROR RECOVERY.  If a  write  error  is  encountered,  a
       section  of  blank tape enough to cover the size of the failed record is
       written onto the tape and the record is re-written.   If  the  retry  is
       unsuccessful,  then  another  section  of blank tape is written, and the
       record  is  tried  once  again.   If  this  cycle  finally  succeeds  in
       successfully  writing the record before OECMAX tries (currently 20 tries
       is the default) then the SAVE will  proceed  normally.   Otherwise,  the
       OPERATOR  is  asked to set the tape aside and mount a new tape, at which
       point the SAVE is restarted from there.  The only problem with this is -
       30 pages are lost and there's a good chance the tape won't verify.  If a
       lot of "DATA WRITE ERRORS" output, and the recovery was  "UNSUCCESSFUL",
       abort the job and start over with a "new" tape.

            The header record for each tape is actually read back after  it  is
       written to ensure that it made it out to the tape successfully.

            B.  INPUT ERROR RECOVERY.  On input, if an I/O error or consistency
       error  (bad  record  sequence number, bad prologue code) is encountered,
       the tape is searched backwards for the last good record.  If it  is  not
       found,  the tape is searched forwards for the first good record that can
       be found.  If it is found, a message stating what  the  last  disk  page
       restored or verified is printed.  The tape is then searched for the next
       good record.  If it is not found on  the  remainder  of  the  tape,  the
       OPERATOR  is  asked  to mount the next tape (if one exists).  Otherwise,
       the restore continues from the record that was found.

            C.  FATAL TAPE  OUTPUT  ERRORS.   Tape  should  be  given  to  Tape
       Librarian  for salvage or for scrapping.  Another tape should be made to
       take its place in the set.

            D.  TAPE OVERWRITES.  ASP will not allow a tape to  be  overwritten
       during a given ASP SAVE RUN if the HEADER on that tape indicates that it
       has been written during the run.  Should the occasion  arise,  an  ERROR
       message will output.  

            E.  OECMAX AND SRCLEN COMMANDS.  These commands set the  number  of
       times  an  output  record is tried to be written out before asking for a
       new tape, and the number of records to be search in input error recovery
       for a good record in the forward direction.  UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES,
       THESE COMMANDS SHOULD NOT BE USED.

                       MAGCON - MAGNETIC TAPE CONVERSION
                       ------ - -------- ---- ----------

       I.  INTRODUCTION TO MAGCON

       MAGCON is a program which transfers  data  and  will  convert  from  one
       character set to another in the process.  It runs on the TYMCOM X and is
       designed mainly for use with magnetic tapes and disk (FTA, MTA and  DSK)
       although  it  will  use  other  devices.   MAGCON will perform blocking,
       duplication, character set conversion, unblocking, and positioning.   It
       can  also prepare an octal dump of a file which can be printed or type a
       file containing text.

       MAGCON may be used in either of two modes, dialog  or  command.   During
       dialog  mode,  information  is  input  to  MAGCON in terms of answers to
       questions.  Command mode requires the user to input in a specific format
       the  information  needed to effect a data transfer or store a command or
       perform other functions.  MAGCON can be  operated  from  command  files.
       When  MAGCON  is started up, it is in dialog mode;  to change to command
       mode, an "!" is input  as  the  answer  to  the  first  question.   (See
       Sections 3 and 4.)

       Character sets with more than 128 characters cannot  be  fully  handled,
       and  characters  in  some  sets may not have suitable equivalents in the
       target desired sets.  If a character cannot be translated, MAGCON places
       a  back slash "\" in that position in the record.  A tally of the number
       of bad characters (not translatable) is printed out when the transfer is
       complete.

       In general, commands and switches may be abbreviated to  any  number  of
       characters  that  will  allow  that  command to be uniquely interpreted.
       However, no more than six characters are checked for validity in any  of
       the commands.

       A command file that MAGCON will read for  commands  is  denoted  by  the
       character "@".

       To leave MAGCON, type an ALT-MODE or a CONTROL C (^C) or  use  the  QUIT
       command during command mode.

MAGCON


       II.  Definitions

       The  following  definitions  should  be  helpful  in  understanding  the
       information that must be supplied to MAGCON.

       BLOCK

       A block pertains to a set of one or more records which MAGCON deals with
       as a unit.  On a tape, this will be the same as a physical record.

       LOGICAL RECORD

       A record refers to a contiguous set of characters which may be delimited
       by  a  CR-LF  sequence  or be defined by a character count.  A record is
       artificially defined;  it has no relationship to the device.

       BLOCK FACTOR

       This refers to the number of records contained in a block.   This  is  a
       value that the user of MAGCON must supply for tape files.  Blocking, the
       grouping of records together in a block involves a special structure  or
       meaning  in  only  two  cases.   One is the special block structure of a
       VEBCDIC file, and the other is the separation  of  HPASCII  blocks  with
       blank tape.  (See also Section 5.)

       UNBLOCKED TAPE

       In this context, an unblocked tape will refer to one whose block  factor
       is one.

       PHYSICAL RECORD

       A physical record is device dependent and refers to the smallest unit of
       data  that  can  be  processed  by  the hardware (128 words for disk, 80
       columns for card reader, the data between gaps for magnetic tape).   The
       blocks  and  records  mentioned  above may cross the boundaries of these
       physical records.

       CHARACTER OR BYTE

       The number of bits forming a character or byte is dependent on the  mode
       of  the  data.   If one is reading an EBCDIC tape, the character size of
       the input is considered to be eight bits.  If operating in  image  mode,
       the byte size dealt with is a whole word, 36 bits.

       INDUSTRY TAPE

       An industry tape  or  industry  compatible  tape  refers  to  one  whose
       character  size  is  eight  bits  and  which can be read or written four
       characters at a time (in 32 bit words).

       EOF MARK

       An EOF mark follows every file on a magnetic tape.   It  consists  of  a
       record  containing  an  octal 17 (for 7-track tapes) or an octal 23 (for
       9-track tapes).

       EOT MARK

       MAGCON does not write any special end of tape mark.

       III.  Questions Asked in Dialog Mode

       A set of questions is asked the user for the  input  and  output  files.
       The first two questions are always asked.  Depending upon the answers to
       those questions and whether  the  file  is  for  input  or  output,  the
       remaining  questions which apply will be asked.  Changes to the numbered
       questions, asked during the dialog or not, may be  made  as  noted  when
       MAGCON prompts for corrections following the dialog, or before a repeat.

       1.  FILE:

       Enter a file name which may take one of the following general forms.

                        DEVICE:FILE.EXTENSION(username)

                                      or

                           DEVICE:(username)FILE.EXT

       The complete file specification is optional and  will  take  on  default
       values  if  any  part  of  it  is omitted.  For example, the device will
       default to DSK:  and the user name to the current disk area.  The  input
       and  output  file names will be created as follows.  The file names will
       have the form FILXXX where XXX is a three-digit  number,  and  the  file
       extensions  will  have the form XXX where is XXX is the same three-digit
       number.  Numbering starts at 001 when MAGCON is run, and the values  are
       incremented as needed to get unique file names.

       If the output device is a magnetic tape, and the drive is  write-locked,
       MAGCON  allows  the  user  to  remount  the tape correctly and continue.
       MAGCON will type:

               FILE "file spec." STRUCTURE IS WRITE-LOCKED.
               REMOUNT TAPE IF YOU WISH TO CONTINUE
               CONTINUE?

       A "YES" answer tells MAGCON to  continue.   A  "NO"  answer  causes  the
       program to restart the output dialog.

       Changes:  There are no restrictions;  however the rest of the dialog for
       either  input  or  output  is  done  over if the device changes from the
       previous value.

       Wild card file names (or parts of names) may be used to  effect  various
       transfers  of  multiple  files.  The following table explains results of
       the legal wild card transfers.

       3.  VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS?

       This question is asked for disk and mag tape devices  if  the  specified
       mode  is  ASCII,  HPASCII,  or GEASCII.  The supplied default is YES for
       VEBCDIC and SIXBIT mode and NO otherwise.

       4. CRLF'S IN ASCII FILE?

       Are carriage-return line-feed sequences included in ASCII,  HPASCII  and
       GEASCII  files?   This question applies only to one of these three types
       of files on a disk or mag tape and is not asked otherwise.

       Changes:  The value may be changed  if  mode  is  HPASCII,  GEASCII,  or
       ASCII.

       5[A].  [MAXIMUM] RECORD SIZE

       One form of this question is always asked if disk or mag tape device and
       not in OCTAL mode.  The bracketed portion is printed for variable length
       record files.  Enter the number of characters in a  logical  record  or,
       for variable length records, the maximum number.

       Changes:  Need same conditions as for question to be asked.  When making
       a  change,  the item number to enter is "5" and never "5A" regardless of
       which form of the question was asked.

       6.  BLOCKING FACTOR:

       This question is asked for non-disk files.  Enter the number of  logical
       records contained in one block.  The supplied default is 1 for tapes and
       0 for disk (to satisfy MAGCON) when the question is not  asked  or  when
       the user supplies a 0.

       Changes:  Can be changed if tape.

       8.  STOP ON ERRORS?

       This question is always asked.  Should the job be aborted  on  a  parity
       error in the file in question?

       Changes:  no restrictions.

       9.  HEADERS FOR LPT?

       Should the LPT (line printer) listing include a header consisting of the
       user's user name, output file name, extension, time and date?

       Changes:  Can be changed if LPT device.

       NOTE:  Questions numbered 10 through 20 are asked for tape files only.

MAGCON


       10.  IS THIS AN ULTRA TECH TAPE?

       This question is not normally asked, and the  supplied  default  is  NO.
       This feature supplies a terminator (octal 25) for each logical record in
       the non-ASCII output file.

       Changes:  Changes may be made if the following conditions are all  true.
       The  file  must  be  output, tape, and in any mode other than one of the
       three ASCII modes.  The input file must currently be in ASCII.

       11.  DENSITY:

       What is the density of the magnetic tape?  The options are:

                 200
                 556
                 800
                 1600
                 6250

       Changes:  Changeable for tape devices.

       12.  PARITY:

       This question is asked for 7-track tapes only.  The supplied default  is
       ODD otherwise.  Enter the parity of the magnetic tape, ODD or EVEN.

       Changes:  Value may be changed if device is a 7-track tape.

       13.  ADVANCE:

       Enter the  number  of  eof  marks  that  MAGCON  should  advance  before
       processing  a file.  If a magnetic tape has labels, there may be several
       eof marks per file, depending on the label type.  If there is no advance
       count, the user should input a zero.

           BACKSPACE:

       Tells MAGCON to backspace the magnetic tape n eof marks and then forword
       space one eof mark if the tape is not at load point.  BACKSPACE is asked
       only if the answer to ADVANCE was zero.

       Changes:  Changeable for tapes.

       14.  ADVANCE RECORDS:

       This question is asked for input tape files.  The supplied default is 0.
       Enter  the  number  of  logical  records to skip before reading the tape
       file.

       Changes:  Changeable for tapes.

       15. REWIND:

       When should the magnetic tape be rewound?  The options are:

                 BEFORE (the operation)
                 AFTER (the operation)
                 ALWAYS (before and after the operation)
                 OMIT (do not rewind)

       Changes:  Changeable for tapes.

       NOTE:  The following feature is not fully operational (at least not  for
       IBM  labels).  In order to read back a labeled tape, the advance records
       or advance files options may be used to skip over extra records or  file
       marks.

       16.  LABEL:

       What should the label look like?  The options are:

                 NONE (no label)
                 MINE (special DEC labels)
                 DIGITAL   (DEC COBOL labels)
                 BURROUGHS (standard BURROUGHS labels)
                 IBM (IBM 360 labels)
                 GE635 (General Electric 635 labels)

       Labels are written in the character set specified  except  for  IBM  and
       GE635  labels.   IBM  labels  are  written in BCD for 7-track drives and
       EBCDIC for 9-track drives.  GE635 labels are always written in GEBCD.

       If a label is used, the following 2 questions are asked:


            REEL:

       Sets the reel serial number in labels that have this feature.  For  some
       labels  the  reel  serial  number is retained when writing over a label.
       For instance, for BURROUGHS labels the output tape is read  to  retrieve
       the  serial number and then a new label is written with this number.  To
       override this feature the reel option is given and the  output  tape  is
       not read first.


            SCAN TAPE FOR FILE?

       Should the magnetic tape be searched until the input file name is  found
       or  an  end  of  tape condition is detected.  The search is in a forward
       direction only.  (Used with labelled tapes only.)

       Changes:  Changeable for tapes.

MAGCON


       18. SPECIAL 36-BIT MODE?

       This question is not asked during the dialog and is defaulted to NO.  It
       refers  to a means of interpreting the characters read in from tape as a
       series of 8-bit characters  in  a  packed  format  containing  four  and
       one-half  characters  per  word  (characters  may cross word boundaries.
       (The author has found no case in which MAGCON stores the characters read
       from tape in this fashion;  it may be an obsolete feature.)

       Changes:  Changeable if tape and the mode is either HPASCII, EBCDIC,  or
       VEBCDIC.

       19. INDUSTRY TAPE?

       This question is not asked during the dialog.  The default  is  YES  for
       EBCDIC  and  HPASCII  tapes  and NO otherwise.  This refers to a tape in
       industry compatible mode in which its 8-bit characters  are  written  or
       read  in  groups  of  four  (a  32-bit  word).   The  buffer  storage of
       characters  to  be  written  (or  just  read)  contains  words  of  four
       characters with the low order four bits not used.

       Changes:  Changeable if tape and the mode is either HPASCII, EBCDIC,  or
       VEBCDIC.

       20.  UNLOAD TAPE?

       Should the magnetic tape be unloaded after the operation is completed?

       Changes:  no restrictions.

       22.  MULTIPLE OUTPUT FILES FOR THIS INPUT FILE?

       This question is asked for input files.  MAGCON will allow the  user  to
       split  up  the input file by blocks into separate output files.  In this
       case, a block is considered to be a physical record  on  the  particular
       device  involved.  if the user answers YES, then the following questions
       will be asked:


            NUMBER OF BLOCKS TO SKIP:

       If the input file is being split  into  separate  output  files,  MAGCON
       allows  the  user  to  skip  a  number of blocks before writing into the
       output file.


            NUMBER OF BLOCKS TO TRANSFER:

       If the input file is being split into separate output files, MAGCON asks
       how many blocks to transfer.

       Changes:  Need same conditions as for question to be asked.

       23.  DO YOU WISH ONLY 1 OUTPUT RECORD PER INPUT RECORD?

       This question is asked if output, the file  is  on  disk,  the  mode  is
       either  GEASCII,  HPASCII,  or ASCII, and the output record size is less
       than the input record size.  In other cases, the supplied default is YES
       meaning  the  output  records may be truncated.  If the user answers NO,
       then MAGCON will create a new record from information remaining from  an
       input record which will not fit in the output record.

       Changes:  Need same conditions as for question to be asked.

MAGCON


       24. DELETE TRAILING BLANKS?

       This question is asked for output files when the device is disk and  the
       mode is HPASCII, GEASCII, or ASCII.  It does not apply to other cases.

       Changes:  Need same conditions as for question to be asked.

       NOTE:  All of the above numbered questions may be changed as noted  when
       MAGCON   requests   corrections   at   the   end  of  dialog  for  input
       specifications and for output specifications.  For example:

       ALL [INPUT ] ENTRIES CORRECT?
           [OUTPUT]

       To change one of the attributes,  enter  "N"  to  this  question.   Then
       MAGCON will ask:

       ITEM TO CHANGE?

       Enter the number of the  appropriate  question.   MAGCON  will  ask  the
       question  if  the  change  conditions  are  met,  and  the answer can be
       supplied.  These questions continue until a  "Y"  answer  indicates  all
       entries  are  correct.   MAGCON  allows corrections after each dialog or
       before a repeat.  Enter input changes only when MAGCON asks about  input
       entries and output entries only when MAGCON asks about output entries.

       NOTE:  The remaining questions are not numbered and  cannot  be  altered
       once they are answered.

       USING "DSK:MAGCON.DAT" CONVERSION FILE - OK?

       This question is asked if MAGCON finds a conversion file in  the  user's
       directory.  If it is acceptable to use this file, then answer YES.  If a
       NO answer is given, then the standard file found in SYS  is  used.   For
       more  information  about  using  a  special  conversion  table,  see the
       documentation for the  program  MAGTAB  found  in  MAGTAB.DOC  and  also
       MAGCON.INF.

       SUBSTITUTIONS?

       MAGCON allows the user to make a small number of changes to the standard
       substitutions  in the conversion table MAGCON uses by entering them from
       the keyboard.  If this question is answered affirmatively,  MAGCON  will
       type:

       MAKE SUBSTITUTONS:

       Type the new character first.  MAGCON will type " for ".  Then type  the
       character  to  substituted  for.   When done with all the substitutions,
       type an extra carriage return.

       A FOR Z
       Z FOR A

       Each time MAGCON encounteres an "A" in the input file,  a  "Z"  will  be
       substituted and vica-versa.  Printing characters are the only characters
       that may be used for substituting.

       OKAY TO WRITE ON OLD FILE?

       Is it all right to write over the existing file on disk  with  the  name
       specified?

       REPEAT SPECIFICATIONS?

       This question  is  asked  following  a  completed  data  transfer.   The
       transfer  may  be repeated with the same specifications, or the user may
       correct individual responses;  MAGCON will ask if all input and then all
       output  specifications  are  correct.   If either the file device or the
       mode changes, then the remaining questions of the dialog will be  asked.
       In other cases, the user will be responsible for changed responses which
       should be altered to conform with any of his/her corrections.  Use  with
       care.   (See  warning  concerning the use of wild card file names at the
       beginning of this section.)

       IV.  Command Mode Structure


                                         NOTE

           THIS FORM OF MAGCON IS SELDOM USED;  DESPITE IT'S ADVANTAGES, IT
           IS  MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE OPERATOR SINCE THE PROGRAM WILL DO NO
           PROMPTING FOR INPUT AND OUTPUT SPECIFICATION.


       IV.A Format of Data Transfer Commands

       The commands which effect a data transfer, performing the same  function
       as  the  dialog, use the traditional DECsystem-10 command string format.
       MAGCON will accept one input file  specification  and  one  output  file
       specification  separated  by  a  back  arrow "_" or equal sign "=".  For
       example:

                            OUTPUT FILE_INPUT FILE

                                      or

                            OUTPUT FILE=INPUT FILE

       The file specifications are the same as described in Section 2, question

       Each input or output file file specification must  contain  switches  to
       give  MAGCON the necessary information about the files being handled.  A
       switch begins with a slash and is terminated by the next slash or by the
       carriage  return  which  terminates  the  whole  command  as  well.  For
       example:

                                    /SWITCH

                                      or

                               /SWITCH:ARGUMENT

       In all cases, switches may be abbreviated to the  number  of  characters
       that  will allow unique interpretation of that switch.  In the following
       table of possible switches, "n" represents an  integer  decimal  number,
       and "ARG" represents a key word that must be present.  The values of the
       switches and the arguments  should  be  apparent  from  referencing  the
       corresponding  dialog  question.   Switches  flagged  with an "*" can be
       turned off or have the opposite effect noted by concatenating "NO"  with
       the switch.  For example:  NOLIST, NOCRLF.

       IV.C Additional Commands


          BYE MAGCON returns to monitor level, resets all  I/O,  and  logs  the
                  user off the system.


          DIALOG Returns user  to  dialog  mode.   MAGCON  will  ask  the  user
                  questions  about  the  input  and  output file specifications
                  according to the explanation in Section II.


          ERASE This command causes the current retained command to be  deleted
                  and  returns  MAGCON  to  the  immediate  mode  of operation;
                  MAGCON will go back to executing commands as they are typed.


          EXIT MAGCON returns to monitor level and resets all I/O.


          PRINT Types out the current retained command.


          RETAIN Used to save a subsequent command.  In  this  mode,  the  next
                  command entered is not executed immediately.  Instead, MAGCON
                  saves the command line and allows the user to  edit  it.   To
                  edit  the  command string, the user need only retype the part
                  of the command he/she wishes to change.   Items  that  follow
                  the back arrow or equal sign will be edited to the input side
                  of the command, while items that precede the  back  arrow  or
                  equal sign will be edited to the output side of the command.


          REWIND Rewinds the specified magnetic tape.  MAGCON will  prompt  for
                  the  device to be rewound (the device name must be terminated
                  with a colon ":".  In this way, a tape may be rewound without
                  transferring any data.

                  RUN Performs the current retained command.

                  QUIT Same function as EXIT.


          The following commands may be input to MAGCON during a file transfer.
          Unless noted, they will not affect the transfer.


          FILES Prints the input and output file specifications for the user.

          V.  Tape Formats

          MAGCON handles a large number of tape formats.  The
          following is a description of the various record formats
          and their usual characteristics.

          ASCII

          An ASCII record is a set of contiguous 7-bit characters whose
          boundary may be determined by a carriage return-line feed
          sequence or a character count.  An ASCII disk file is stored with
          five 7-bit characters to the word with the low order bit not
          used.  A successive record begins at the character following
          the last character of the previous record.  If
          terminated by a CR-LF sequence, the
          records are probably random length; the records would
          be fixed length otherwise and may contain a blank fill.  MAGCON
          will fill a fixed length record with blanks on output to
          satisfy the character count given.  Null characters found
          during an ASCII transfer are discarded.

          HPASCII

          The general characteristics of ASCII files hold for HPASCII
          files with the exception that the characters are 8-bit
          values.  A buffered record is stored with four characters to each
          word and the low order four bits not used.  Tapes
          written by MAGCON in HPASCII format will contain additional
          blank tape between each block.  Character values = 377 octal are
          equivalent to the ASCII values.

          GEASCII

          The general characteristics of ASCII files hold for GEASCII
          files.  The characters are 9 bits long and are stored on the
          disk four to a word.  Characters whose values
          are = 377 octal are equivalent to the ASCII characters.

          BCD

          Records are composed of a contiguous set of 6-bit
          characters of a length determined by a character count.  In core,
          bytes are stored six to a word.  In order to satisfy an
          output character count, MAGCON will fill with blanks; records
          being read from a tape may have this same characteristic.

          BCL (BURROUGH'S 6-BIT)

          Same general characteristics as BCD.

MAGCON


       CDC (CONTROL DATA)

          Same general characteristics as BCD.

          GEBCD (GENERAL ELECTRIC BCD)

          Same general characteristics as BCD.

          HONBCD (HONEYWELL BCD)

          Same general characteristics as BCD.

          FIXSIX

          Same general characteristics as BCD.

          SIXBIT

          A SIXBIT record consists of a contiguous set of 6-bit
          characters.  When buffered, the records consist of an
          integral number of words.  The right half of the first
          word, the header, contains the number of characters in
          the record, excluding that first word, and the remainder
          of the record follows.

          EBCDIC

          An EBCDIC record is a set of 8-bit characters whose
          boundary is determined by a character count.  When
          buffered or stored, the characters are packed four to
          a word with the low order four bits not used.  In order
          to satisfy an output character count, MAGCON will pad
          with blanks; records being read from a tape may have
          this same characteristic.

MAGCON


          VEBCDIC

          Variable EBCDIC characters are the same as EBCDIC
          characters.  VEBCDIC files may have one of two block
          structures.  In unblocked format, a block and a record
          are equivalent.  In blocked format (blocking factor > 1), a
          block contains more than one record and has an additional
          header word describing the size of the entire block.  The
          individual records follow.


                          |--------|--------|-------------------|
          unblocked:      | length |   00   |      record       |
                          |--------|--------|-------------------|

                          |--|--|--|--|-----|-----------|--|--|-----|
          blocked:        |bl|00|rl|00|rec 1|   . . .   |rl|00|rec n|
                          |--|--|--|--|-----|-----------|--|--|-----|

                          where:  length = block and record character count
                                           (2 byte quantity)
                                  00     = 2 bytes of 0
                                  bl     = block character count
                                  rl     = record character count

          In these formats, the character  counts  include  the  header  words.
          When buffered, bytes are stored four to a word as for EBCDIC.

          IMAGE

          IMAGE mode referes to the treatment of a file as a contiguous set  of
          binary  data.   Every  bit  counts.   If the input file is treated as
          IMAGE, then the output mode must be in IMAGE or OCTAL.

          OCTAL

          OCTAL mode can be used as an output mode only.   The  input  file  is
          treated  as image no matter how the user specifies it.  An OCTAL mode
          file, when typed on the TTY or spooled to a line printer, is an octal
          dump of the original file.

                                MAGCON FOLKLORE

       The helpful hints documented below are derived from  MAGCON  experiences
       and are presented to assist you with situations which might otherwise be
       unduly troublesome.

       When doing a MAGCON restore, you should  always  work  from  a  TYMCOM-X
       utility directory (e.g., OPER).  Only after the conversion has been QA'D
       should files be renamed into the user's directory.

       The most common data formats in use today are ASCII, HPASCII, EBCDIC and
       VEBCDIC.  BCD is seldom used.

       9-track tapes always use odd parity.

       7-track tapes usually use even parity.

       There is no guaranteed MAGCON capability to convert binary files  except
       to or from another PDP-10.  The IMAGE option assumes the conversion will
       be 36-bit word to 36-bit word.

       Given the above limitaion, if you should get a MAGCON job description to
       convert  "all the files in my directory" including REL and SAV extension
       files, expect that those binary files won't  convert  properly.   Unless
       the  destination  computer  has a fancy conversion program at the user's
       end, binary conversions probably won't work.

       If a MAGCON requests that HPASCII be used, it is very likely the  user's
       system  is  a mini-computer;  most mini's use 8-bit ASCII, especially on
       16-bit word lengths where 8-bit can result in two characters  per  word.
       The PDP-10'S, on the other hand, use 7-bit ASCII.

       If you run into trouble in a PDP-10 conversion, it might be a good  idea
       to suggest that PIP be used instead of MAGCON.

       One of the main problems in MAGCON is when the user  doesn't  understand
       or  know  the  record length involved in the job.  To help find out what
       record length applies, it is very helpful  to  find  out  what  type  of
       computer the MAGCON is to be used for.

       In general, it is best to use fixed length records,  especially  if  you
       can  supply  the  record length of the longest record in the file;  then
       smaller records in the file will be filled in by MAGCON.

       However, for most ASCII or EBCDIC conversions, the answer to the  prompt
       for "VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS?" should generally be YES.

       The law of diminishing returns  certainly  can  apply  to  MAGCON.   You
       should  not spend hours on confusing tape conversion;  it is recommended
       that you spend no longer than  30-45  minutes  trying  to  discover  the
       correct MAGCON specifications.

       After  that  a  call  to  the  customer  or  his/her   BT   TYMNET   INC
       representative  for  better  information  is probably the best course of
       action.  Remember, it is not  unusual  for  a  requested  MAGCON  to  be
       technically impossible to perform correctly.

                                MAGCON QA HINTS

       Use the MAGCON terminal hardcopy for  the  directory  of  the  converted
       tape;  it will show the tape positions.

       Comparing CHECKSUM'S is not a good way to QA  a  MAGCON;   even  if  the
       conversion was correct, there were probably enough variables involved in
       the conversion so that the converted file's CHECKSUM will not agree with
       the original file's CHECKSUM.

       If MAGCON reports "bad characters", this does not reflect READ or  WRITE
       errors.   Rather,  it  means  that  it  was  unable to translate certain
       characters from one mode to another.  This is to  be  expected  in  some
       modes;   certain EBCDIC characters might not be in the PDP-10 conversion
       tables.  It is the number of "bad characters" which is crucial.  All bad
       characters  will  have  a  backslash  in  place  of  the  untranslatable
       character.  Check the listing of the converted file;  if there is a high
       number  of  backslashes, a call to the customer or his/her BT TYMNET INC
       representative might be in order.

       Most of the data involved  in  MAGCONS  is  in  field  format--that  is,
       columns.   If  the  listing  you  output  doesn't line up, there are two
       common reasons:

            1.  Slanting columns indicate that the  record  length  number  you
       input might be off a few characters.

            2.  When the data appears to wrap around the listing, there may  be
       an incorrect blocking factor input.

       If MAGCON printout shows one  long  line  with  ***  in  each  righthand
       margin,  it may be corrected by answering NO to the question:  "CR LF IN
       DATA?" Normally, and especially for  ASCII  data,  the  answer  to  this
       question should be YES.

                                  MAGCON BUGS

       When you are converting from disk to tape you can use *.*  to  refer  to
       all  files  in  a  given  directory.   However, to store all the files a
       second time (i.e., REPEAT SPECS?), only the first file in the  directory
       will be stored on tape.  To get around this, answer YES to the question:
       "CHANGE INPUT SPECS?" AND "CHANGE OUTPUT SPECS?" What  you  "change"  is
       merely to type in *.* again.

       MAGCON won't write a logical end of tape mark;  this  is  not  really  a
       problem, but it means that it is impossible to APPEND to a MAGCON tape.

       The LABELS option does not work.  If you use it, you'll get  garbage  on
       the tape instead of labels.

                     PIP - PERIPHERAL INTERCHANGE PROGRAM
                     ------------------------------------

       ((INTRODUCTION))

       PIP is the subsystem provided by Digital Equipment Corp to  provide  for
       the  transfer  of  files  on  the  PDP-10 from any standard input/output
       device to any other standard input/output device.

       Through use of various switches, PIP can perform simple editing  of  the
       files  as  they are transferred from one device to another.  It can also
       control certain magnetic tape  control  functions  as  setting  density,
       parity,  and  positioning the tape.  The program references MTA's (older
       DEC drives) and FTA's (newer STC drives).   Usernames  on  the  TYMCOM-X
       must  be  converted to PPN'S (PROJECT-PROGRAMMER NUMBERS) if they are to
       be used as an operand of a PIP command.


                                         NOTE

           In the exec, a legal username can be converted into it's PPN  by
           using  the  command  PPN USERNAME (CR).  For additional details,
           refer to the mini-manual titled TYMCOM-X ACCOUNTING  AND  USERS.
           For  a  thorough  documentation  on  all  aspects of PIP you are
           referred to the  DEC-10-PPEO-D  writeup  on  PIP  (contained  in
           DECSYSTEM-10 USER'S HANDBOOK AND REFERENCE MANUAL).


       ((COMMAND SUMMARY))

       PIP is accessed from the EXEC by typing '.R PIP(CR)' and  responds  with
       an  asterisk (*) to indicate that it is ready for commands.  The command
       string is entered to perform the desired operation  and  the  string  is
       terminated  and  executed  when  a  carriage return is typed.  When this
       operation is completed, PIP again prompts  with  the  character  (*)  to
       indicated  it is ready for the next command.  To EXIT from PIP, the user
       types a Control C (^C).

       All PIP commands that transfer data have the following general format:

                                  --- -------

       All PIP commands must be formatted to utilize one destination device and
       at least one source device.  In PIP command strings, all devices must be
       followed by a colon (:).  All legal devices are summarized below.

PIP DEVICES AND SWITCHES


                                 PIP SWITCHES
                                 --- --------

       Any of the many options available in PIP may be selected  by  use  of  a
       switch.   Switches  that  do  not  reference magtape are preceded in the
       command string with a slash  (/);   magtape  switches  are  enclosed  in
       parenthesis  and must be typed immediately following the device to which
       they refer.  If more than on switch is used on either the destination of
       source  halves  of  the command string they are enclosed in parenthesis.
       Below is a list of PIP switches that are most  often  used.   (The  full
       list can be found in the document mentioned above.)

        MAGTAPE
        SWITCH           EFFECT
        ------           ------

        (M6)             Set tape density at 6250 BPI (9TRK default)
        (M1)             Set tape density at 1600 BPI
        (M8)             Set tape density at 800 BPI (7TRK default)
        (M5)             Set tape density at 556 BPI
        (ME)             Set parity even (odd parity is the default)
        (MA)             Advance the tape 1 file
        (M#nA)           Advance the tape n (some number) files
        (MB)             Backspace the tape 1 file
        (M#nB)           Backspace the tape n files
        (MW)             Rewind the tape
        (MT)             Skip to the logical END-OF-TAPE
        (MF)             Mark an END-OF-FILE

        NON-MAGTAPE
        SWITCH           EFFECT
        -----------      ------

        /B               Initialize devices in BINARY MODE; transfer
                         data one word at a time, no interpretation.
        /C               Delete trailing spaces; convert multiple spaces
                         to tabs.
        /E               Replace chars. 73 thru 80 with spaces (mainly
                         used with CDR).
        /G               Ignore (skip over) all I/O errors.
        /H               Initialize devices in IMAGE BINARY MODE.
        /I               Initialize devices in IMAGE MODE.
        /L               List a directory of the source device.
        /N               Delete sequence numbers from source file.
        /O               Insert sequence numbers at the beginning of
                         each line.  Start with 00000, increment by 1.

PIP SAMPLE RUNS


       ((SAMPLE RUNS))

       Copying Files from DISK to DISK:

        *DSK:[1,4]TOTALS.DAT _ DSK:PART1.DAT,PART2.DAT(CR)
        This transfers PART1.DAT and PART2.DAT from the directory
        of the user running the program into a single file TOTALS.DAT
        in the directory of the user whose PPN is 1,4.

        *DSK:/X/S[12,576]*.* _ DSK:[1,6]*.*(CR)
        Copies all files in [1,6] to the directory with PPN 12,576
        and inserts sequence numbers incremented by 10 in each file.

       Reading Cards to DISK:

        *DSK:[132,5763]CARDS.FT4/E _ CDR:(CR)
        Reads cards into a file named CARDS.FT4 for PPN 132,5763
        using the switch that replaces positions 73 thru 80 on the
        cards with spaces on the disk file.

        *FTA0:(M8) _ CDR:/T(CR)
        Reads card deck onto a file on magtape mounted on 0 and
        strips off the trailing blanks from each card read.

              (NOTE:  PIP will report the number of cards read.)

       Reading and Writing Magtapes:

        *DSK:[1,15]/X/B _ FTA1:(M8)DATA.BIN,DATA1,BIN,DATA3.BIN(CR)
        From FTA1 at 800 BPI, the files DATA.BIN, DATA1.BIN and
        DATA3.BIN are restored as separate files to the directory with
        PPN 1,15; the files are restored in BINARY MODE.

        *FTA0:(M8)/X _ DSK:[2,24]*.SYM(CR)
        Stores all files in 2,24 with the SYM extension as separate
        files on tape unit 0 at 800 BPI.

        *FTA0:(MW) _ (cr)
        Rewinds FTA0.

       Reading and Writing Paper Tapes:

        *PTP:/I _ [234,567]FILEX.FOO(cr)
        Punches a paper tape in IMAGE MODE of the file FILEX.FOO.

        *DSK:[1,2]FROM.TAP _ PTR:(CR)
        Reads from PAPER TAPE READER to a file in 1,2 named FROM.TAP.

PIP ERRORS


       ((ERRORS AND RECOVERIES))

       If any error occurs while running PIP, the operation will be aborted and
       the  diagnostic message will be preceded by a question mark (?).  On the
       other hand, if the /G switch has been used, the program will ignore  the
       error  and attempt to continue execution.  Be aware of errors that occur
       in the output device.

        There are 5 types of error diagnostics that can occur in PIP:

        ERROR
        STRING                MEANING
        ------                -------

        C                     A command string error has occurred.
        FR                    A file reference error has occurred.
        I/O                   An input/output error has occurred.
        RIM                   A READ-IN-MODE specification error.
        S                     All other types of errors.

       Here are some of the error strings that can provide diagnostic  help  in
       determining why a PIP command failed:

       ?DEVICE DEV: DOES NOT EXIST
        I/O - Either the device name has been misspelled or the device
        does not exist.

       ?DEVICE DEV: NOT AVAILABLE
        I/O - The device has not been properly assigned or is assigned
        to another job.

       ?ILLEGAL DENSITY SPECIFIED ON TAPE DEVICE
        I/O - The density specified is not available on that drive.

       ?FILE FILENAME.EXT ILLEGAL FORMAT
        RIM - Zero length file, job data info not available, block over-
        laps previous block or EOF found when data was expected.

       ?FILENAME.EXT FILE WAS BEING MODIFIED
        FR - Disk file named was being used by some other job; try again
        later.

       ?FILENAME.EXT FILE WAS NOT FOUND
        FR - The file specified was not found during a lookup.

       ?FILENAME.EXT INCORRECT PROJECT-PROGRAMMER NUMBER
        FR - The PPN given for a disk file is incorrect.

PIP ERRORS


       ?INPUT DEVICE DEV: FILE FILENAME.EXT
        I/O - Another message follows (see below).

       ?LINE TOO LONG
        A line greater than 140 characters was found in the source file.

       ?NO FILE NAMED FILENAME.EXT
        FR - No such file was found when PIP searched the directory.

       ?OUTPUT DEVICE DEV: FILE FILENAME.EXT
        I/O - Another message follows (see below).

       ?PIP COMMAND ERROR
        C - Either an illegal PIP command string, a non-existent switch,
        or a filename other than *.* was requested for a device that
        does not have a directory (e.g. PTR, PTP, CDR).

            The following are PIP secondary I/O diagnostic messages.
       They may accompany one of the error messages listed above.

        MESSAGE/DEVICE           MEANING
        --------------           -------

        BINARY DATA INCOMPLETE   Length of a block disagrees with the
           PTR                   word count.

        CKSUM OR PARITY ERROR    A read or write error has occurred.
           ALL

        INPUT BUFFER OVERFLOW    A block is too large for the buffers.
           ALL

        DEVICE ERROR             The DATA CONTROL UNIT for a device has
           ALL                   detected a loss of data.

        PHYSICAL EOT             The end of tape has been reached.
           MTA,FTA

        WRITE(LOCK) ERROR        An attempt has been made to write on a
           DSK,MTA,FTA           write-locked file.
