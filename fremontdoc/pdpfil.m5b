                              USING FILES IN EXEC
                              -------------------

       Files are an important part of the Tymshare  system.   A  file  contains
       information such as a program or data and is stored on a storage device.
       Unless the  user  declares  files  as  temporary,  files  are  permanent
       storage;   that  is,  they  stay  on the system until the user explicity
       removes them, even  though  he  logs  off  after  each  session  at  the
       terminal.    XEXEC  has  commands  to  create  and  modify  files,  list
       descriptive information about the files, change the standard  protection
       controls  for  files,  copy files, print files, rename files, and delete
       files from the storage area.

                            Rules For Naming Files
                            ----------------------

       The user identifies a file with a file name and an  optional  extension.
       A  file name may contain as many as six characters, with any combination
       of letters and digits.  The user may find it convenient  to  include  an
       extension  in  the  file  identifier to indicate the type of information
       stored on the file.  Usually the extension is a standard one which XEXEC
       recognizes.   A  period  (.) separates the file name from its extension.
       The extension may contain no more than  three  alphanumeric  characters.
       The system reserves certain file names which the user should not attempt
       to use to identify his files.  The following are reserved  files  names:
       ALL,  HELP,  NOT, SAME, and any left substring of the words TERMINAL and
       TELETYPE.

                        Referring To Files In Commands
                        ------------------------------

       All XEXEC commands recognize a reference to an existing file if both the
       file name and extension are specified.  Certain XEXEC commands allow the
       user to refer to a file without specifying an  extension  provided  that
       the  file  identifier  has  a  standard  extension or no extension.  The
       compile-type commands, described on page 51 of  the  TYMCOM-X  Reference
       Manual,  search  for a standard extension or append a standard extension
       to a file identifier that has  no  extension.   The  GET,  RUN,  and  GO
       commands,  described  on  page 66 of the same manual, search for the HGH
       extension first, then the SHR extension, then the SAV extension.  If the
       file  identifier has no extension, SAV is assumed.  If a file identifier
       has a non-standard extension,  the  extension  must  be  specified  when
       referring to the file.

                             Asterisk (*) Notation
                             ---------------------

       Asterisk notation allows the user to specify several files with a single
       identifier.   An  asterisk  (*)  can  be  used  as either part of a file
       identifier to indicate all file names or all extensions.   For  example,
       TEST1.*  refers  to  all  files  with  the name TEST1, regardless of the
       extension.  Similarly, *.F4 refers to all files with the  F4  extension.
       The  user  may  refer to all files in his directory with *.* or the word
       ALL.

       Asterisk notation can  be  used  with  the  following  commands:   COPY,
                                                                         Page 4
EXEC


       DECLARE, DELETE, DIRECTORY, FILES, LIST, PRINT, RENAME, and TYPE.

                 Crosshatch (#) or Question mark (?) Notation
                  -------------------------------------------

       Crosshatch or questiom mark notation also allows  the  user  to  specify
       several files with a single identifier.  A crosshatch or a question mark
       can be used instead of a character in a  file  identifier  to  mean  any
       character.   The  crosshatch or question mark can be used repeatedly and
       can be interspersed throughout the file identifier.  If  the  crosshatch
       or  question  mark  is  at  the  end  of  a  file  name or extension, it
       represents no character  as  well  as  any  character.   TEST#.REL,  for
       example,  refers  to all file identifiers with the REL extension and the
       file name TEST followed by one character or by no characters as  in  the
       case of TEST.REL.  

       The user may refer to all the files previously listed by typing

           TEST#.*

       To refer to all TEST1 files, the user types

           TEST1.*

       To refer once to all the above files that have the NEW or REL extension,
       the user types

           TEST#.#E#

       The crosshatch or question mark notation can be used with the  following
       commands:  COPY, DECLARE, DELETE, DIRECTORY, FILES, and RENAME.

                        NOT or Minus Sign (-) Notation
                        ------------------------------

       To exclude a particular file or group of files from a command, the  user
       may  type  NOT or a minus sign (-) followed by the file name or group of
       names to be excluded.  For example, to refer to all files  except  those
       with the .F4 extension, the user types

           ALL NOT *.F4

       To refer to all files that begin with TEST, except TEST4 and TEST5,  the
       user types

           TEST#.*-TEST4.*-TEST5.* 

       The NOT or minus sign notation can be used with the following  commands:
       DECLARE, DELETE, DIRECTORY, and FILES.


               Referring to Files in Another User's Storage Area
               -------------------------------------------------

       A user can refer to a file in another user's storage area  by  preceding
       the  file name with the owner's user name, enclosed in parentheses.  for
                                                                         Page 5
EXEC


       example, (OLSON) INVEN refers to  the  file  INVEN  located  in  OLSON'S
       storage  area.   One  user  may  gain access to a file in another user's
       storage area if the owner declares that file to be sharable.  The  owner
       can allow another user to run programs from his storage area, read files
       from his storage area, or change files in his storage area.

       For example, if user WONG declares his file COMPUTE to be sharable, user
       ALVIN  can  copy  COMPUTE  to  a  file  named MYCOMP which is in ALVIN'S
       storage area by typing

           COPY (WONG)COMPUTE TO MYCOMP (CARRIAGE RETURN) 

       In the FILES, DIRECTORY, DELETE, and DECLARE commands,  only  the  first
       file  name  in a list of file names can have a user name associated with
       it.  This user name applies to all the files in the list.  For example,

           DELETE (MARGE)FIL1,FIL2,FIL3 (CARRIAGE RETURN) 

       deletes FIL1, FIL2, and FIL3 in MARGE'S storage area if  the  protection
       of each file has been declared ALL.

                                     -----

       ((INTRODUCTION))

       DIRIT is the software that processes  the  following  commands:   FILES,
       DIRECTORY, RENAME, and DELETE.  A description of these commands is found
       in the following paragraphs and in the TYMCOM-X Reference Manual.  DIRIT
       is not directly specified on command input.

       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))

                           LISTING FILE INFORMATION
                           ------------------------

       XEXEC offers commands which  print  descriptive  information  about  the
       files  in  the user's directory.  The FILES command prints the names and
       extensions of the files in the directory.  The DIRECTORY command  prints
       the names and extensions of the files as well as the size, creation date
       and time, date of most recent access, and protection of each file.

       The  user  can  request  that  the  FILES  or  DIRECTORY  command  print
       information  about specified files instead of the entire directory.  For
       example, the command

           -DIRECTORY PDATA,PGM.SAV,TDATA (CARRIAGE RETURN)

       prints the directory information for the files PDATA, PGM.SAV, and TDATA
       only.

       When referring to specific files in the directory, the user may use  the
       special  notation  *.   #,  ?, NOT (or -) and ALL to specify the desired
       files.  For example, if the user wants to  list  all  his  files  except
       those with the REL extension, he uses the command

           -FILES ALL-*.REL (CARRIAGE RETURN)

       The user can modify the information printed by the  FILES  or  DIRECTORY
       command  by  including  switches  in the command.  These switches may be
       used to request additional information about files, to specify the order
       of listing files, or to select files according to various criteria.  The
       switches are described in the 'SWITCHES' paragraph below.
                                                                         Page 7

                               The FILES Command
                               -----------------

       The FILES command prints the names and extensions of the specified files
       in  the  user's  directory  and  any additional information requested by
       switches.  The form of the command is 

           -FILES (file list) (Carriage Return)

       where files list is a list  of  file  names  separated  by  commas,  and
       optional switches.  If the file list is omitted, all files are listed.

       Some examples of the FILES command are shown below.

           COMMAND                RESULT
           -------                ------

           FILES                  Lists the names and extensions
                                  of all the user's files

           FILES *.REL            Lists the names and extensions
                                  of the files with the
                                  extension REL

           FILES /HELP            Prints all switches available
                                  with the FILES command

           FILES /ALPHA /ACCESS   Lists all the user's files in
                                  alphabetical order, showing
                                  the most recent access date
                                  for each file
                                                                         Page 8
DIRIT


                             The DIRECTORY Command
                             ---------------------

       The DIRECTORY command prints the name, extension,  size,  creation  date
       and  time,  file  protection,  and  date  of  most recent access for the
       specified files in the user's directory.  The form of the command is

           -DIRECTORY (file list) (Carriage Return)

       where file list is a  list  of  file  names  separated  by  commas,  and
       optional  switches.   If  the  file  list is omitted, the command prints
       directory information for all files.

       Some examples of the DIRECTORY command are shown below.

           COMMAND                RESULT
           -------                ------

           DIRECTORY              Prints the directory information
                                  for all the user's files

           DIRECTORY PROG.*       Prints the directory information
                                  for all files with the
                                  name PROG regardless
                                  of extension

           DIRECTORY /FAST        Prints the name and extension
                                  for all files

                                   Switches
                                   --------

       There are three types of switches:  switches to  request  additional  or
       restricted  information  about  files,  switches to specify the order of
       listing files,  and  switches  to  select  files  according  to  various
       criteria.   A  switch  can  be  abbreviated  to  the  minimum  number of
       characters required to uniquely identify it and can be terminated by any
       nonalphanumeric  character  such  as  a  blank  or  comma.  The switches
       described in this subsection can be  used  with  any  of  the  following
       commands:  FILES, DIRECTORY, DELETE, RENAME, and DECLARE.

       The following switches  request  additional  or  restricted  information
       about the user's files.

           SWITCH                 INFORMATION REQUESTED
           ------                 ---------------------

           /ACCESS                Date of most recent access

           /CREATION              Creation date

           /FAST                  File name and extension

           /PROTECTION            Protection assigned to the file

           /SECONDS               Creation date and time to
                                  the second

           /SIZE                  Size of the file (number
                                  of storage pages)

           /TIME                  Creation date and time to
                                  the minute

           /TOTAL                 Number of storage pages
                                  and files in the file
                                  list.  This switch is
                                  automatic for the

                                         NOTE

           The user may include several switches in a single command


       Files are normally listed in reverse  chronological  order  by  creation
       date;   that is, the system prints the most recently created file first.
       If the user wants to see the files and corresponding  information  in  a
       different order, the following switches are available.

           SWITCH                 ORDER LISTED
           ------                 ------------

           /ALPHABETICAL          Alphabetically by file name
                                  and secondarily by extension

           /EXTENSION             Files with extensions are 
                                  arranged in alphabetical
                                  order by extension, 
                                  followed by the files
                                  with no extensions

           /STORAGE               Decreasing ord storage

                                  of the largest files is 
                                  listed first

           /UNSORTED              Order is which files appear in
                                  the user's file directory

           /REVERSE               Chronological order of creation.
                                  /REVERSE can be used with
                                  any other switch in this 
                                  table to reverse the order
                                  established by that switch


                                         NOTE

           The switches in the preceding table must be used only one  to  a
           command  except  when  the  /REVERSE switch appears with another
           switch to reverse its order


       The remaining switches select files according to the criteria  specified
       with  the  switch.   All  files in the user's directory except for those
       with the extension TMP are selected when a command is  not  followed  by
       file designations or by any of the switches shown below

           SWITCH                 Files SELECTED
           ------                 --------------

           /AFTER date            Files created on and after 
                                  the date specified

           /BEFORE date           Files created before the
                                  date specified

           /TODAY                 Files created during the
                                  present day

           /TEMPS                 All files including those
                                  with the extension TMP
                                  which the system normally
                                  does not print


                                         NOTE

           The /AFTER and /BEFORE switches can be used together to indicate
           a range of dates


       The user specifies the date by the  day,  first  three  letters  of  the
       month,  and  last  two digits of the year, all separated by dashes.  For
       example,

           29-SEP-79 21-NOV-79 5-JUN-80 

       If the user omits the year and/or month, the system assumes the  current
                                                                        Page 11

       one.  Therefore, any of the three following ways of entering the date is
       acceptable:

           /BEFORE 5-OCT-79 /BEFORE 5-OCT /BEFORE 5

                                DELETING FILES
                                --------------

       The DELETE command removes a file or group  of  files  from  the  user's
       directory.  The command form is

           -DELETE file list (Carriage Return)

       where file list is a list of file names separated by commas and optional
       switches,  including  the  /WAIT  switch, described below, or any of the
       item, sort, or select switches listed in the 'Switches' paragraph above;
       these  switches  provide  additional information about the files, delete
       the files in a certain order, or select certain files to delete.

       The system deletes the file only if its protection allows deletion, that
       is,  if  its  protection  is ALL.  If the user attempts to delete a file
       that has protection other than ALL, does not delete the file and  prints
       the message:

           file name **PROTECTED**

       and does not delete the file.  For example,

           -DELETE TDATA (Carriage Return)

           TDATA **PROTECTED**

           -

       The /WAIT switch instructs the system to ask  the  user  to  verify  the
       DELETE  command  for  each  file  specified  in the command.  The system
       prints the heading

           FILES DELETED:

       followed by a file identifier and a question  mark  (?)  for  each  file
       specified in the command.  The user must type Y to delete the file and N
       to prevent the deletion of the file.  A  Carriage  Return  need  not  be
       typed  after  the  response.   For example, the user wants to delete the
       files

           INV.SEP,PGM1.REL, AND PGM1.F4:

           -DELETE /WAIT INV.SEP,PGM1.* (CARRIAGE RETURN)

           FILES DELETED:
           PGM1    F4   ?Y
           PGM1    REL  ?Y
           INV     SEP  ?Y
           PGM1    CRF  ?N **NOT DELETED**
                                                                        Page 12
DIRIT


           -

       In the example shown below, the user  wants  to  delete  specific  files
       created after April 24.  He uses the /WAIT switch and also requests that
       the system print the size with the file identifier.

           -DELETE ALL /WAIT /SIZE /AFTER 24-APR (CARRIAGE RETURN)

           FILES DELETED:
           OLDF                5  ?Y
           TDATA               5  ?Y **PROTECTED**
           TEXT                5  ?N **NOT DELETED**
           A                   5  ?Y

           -

                                RENAMING FILES
                                --------------

       The RENAME command changes  the  identifiers  of  existing  files.   The
       command form is

           -RENAME old file identifier AS new file identifier (Carriage
           Return)

       For example, to change the name of file LDATA to MDATA, the user types

           -RENAME LDATA AS MDATA (Carriage Return)

       The user may simply type RENAME followed by a Carriage Return,  and  the
       system prompts for the file identifiers.  For example,

           -RENAME (CR)
           OLD NAME:  PROG (CR)
           NEW NAME:  LPROG (CR)

           -

       The system prevents the user from changing the  file  identifier  to  an
       existing file identifier.

       The user may change several file identifiers with one command  by  using
       *, #, or ?  notation.  For example, the command

           -RENAME TEST1.* AS TEST6.* (CR)

       changes the names of all files named TEST1, regardless of extension,  to
       TEST6 with the same extension.  The command

           -RENAME EOM### AS ACT### (CR)

       renames all files whose names begin with EOM and contain six  characters
       to ACT followed by the last three characters of the previous name;  that
       is, EOM122 is changed to ACT122, EOMNTH is changed to ACTNTH, etc.

CKSUM


                                   CHECKSUM
                                   --------

       ((INTRODUCTION))

       A CHECKSUM is a unique alphabetic character  string  associated  with  a
       particular  file  content.   The  CHECKSUM  is  calculated by adding the
       binary equivalent of all the words on the file.  if a  file  is  copied,
       renamed,  or  transferred  from one USER to another, the CHECKSUM should
       remain the same.  If the contents of a file are changed in any way,  the
       CHECKSUM  changes.  Therefore, CHECKSUMS are useful for keeping track of
       various versions of files and for ensuring that  a  file  has  not  been
       altered  in any way.  (NOTE:  The CHECKSUM is not related to the size of
       the file.) CHECKSUMS are also included on tape  directories  for  backup
       copies of disc files.

       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))

       File names can be entered in response to the prompt one per prompt or as
       a list of names separated by either commas or spaces.  They should be in
       the following general format:

                   (USERNAME)FILNAM.EXT

       The file names (but not the  device  or  user  names)  may  contain  the
       wild-card characters "*", or "#".  User names are optional if you are in
       same directory.  After each input line, CKSUM will  type  out  CHECKSUMS
       and ask for the input again.  The user's TTY is the default list device.

       Start the CKSUM program with the command:

                   .R CKSUM

       The program will ask for input by typing:

                INPUT:

       Acceptable responses are  a  list  of  file  names.   To  terminate  the
       program, type a carriage return.

       ((SAMPLE RUN))

       .R CKSUM
       INPUT: (SYS)CKSUM.*      (Normal operation - input from TTY)
       CIVRUP (SYS)CKSUM.LOW    (Output to TTY)
       QAVNEY (SYS)CKSUM.SHR
       INPUT:                   (CR to terminate)

FNDFIL


                                 FNDFIL
                                 ------

       ((INTRODUCTION))

       The FNDFIL program allows you to search all or the partial  DISC  for  a
       given  file  name  or  group  of  files (using 'WILD-CARD' characters to
       accept all entries for field or character position.  FNDFIL  is  similar
       to the 1FIND of the 940.

       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))

       The program is accessed by the command .R FNDFIL and prompts with:

           FILE NAME(S):

       The user may enter a string of file names, separated by commas, each  of
       which can consist of one of the following:

           FILE NAME.*           LOCATES ALL FILES ON THE DISC WITH
                                 THAT NAME AND ANY EXTENSION.

           *.EXT                 LOCATES ALL FILES ON THE DISC WITH
                                 THE SPECIFIED EXTENSION AND ANY NAME

           FILENAME.EXT          LOCATES ALL FILES ON THE DISC WITH
                                 THIS FILENAME AND EXTENSION

           *.*                   LOCATES ALL FILES ON THE DISC

       A file name or extension may contain the wildcard character "#"  or  "?"
       in any position to indicate don't-care characters.

       The program will print the names and locations in the following format:

           (USERNAME)FILENAME.EXT    HR:MIN DAY-MON-YEAR

       Output is normally to the user's TTY;  however, it may  be  diverted  to
       the  logical  device  FNDFIL.   If  disc  file  output  is  desired, the
       following command:

           .AS DSK FNDFIL

       must be issued before running FNDFIL.  This causes output to  be  dumped
       to the file FNDFIL.LST.
                                                                        Page 15
FNDFIL


       ((SAMPLE RUNS))

       FNDFIL is run as follows:

           .R FNDFIL
           FILE NAME(S):  FNDFIL.*
           (GADOL)FNDFIL.FIL               06:38   1-JUN-1976
           (GADOL)FNDFIL.CMP               15:55   2-NOV-1976
           (SYS)FNDFIL.SAV                 13:27  13-JAN-1977

       FNDFIL is extremely fast, and the TTY which  is  normally  used  as  the
       output  device can be changed to any device.  For example, let's use the
       DISC as the output device.

           .AS DSK FNDFIL
           DSK ASSIGNED

           .R FNDFIL
           FILE NAME(S):  SYSTEM.SAV

           EXIT

           .DEAS

       FNDFIL will output the  results  to  a  file  in  OPER  directory  named
       FNDFIL.LST.  The file can be listed on the PRINTER or TTY.

           .TYP FNDFIL.LST
           (M33)SYSTEM.SAV               15:04  16-SEP-1976

       ((INTRODUCTION))

       The Storage SZRPT Report  allows  the  USER  to  receive  specific  disc
       storage  information  on  the  entire disc concerning an individual USER

       The Storage SZRPT Report has several features.  If the user has  Account
       Supervisor  status  but  does not have OPER license or RF license, SZRPT
       will run and give information about all files in the account the user is
       in.   SZRPT  prints  the number of files in addition to the total blocks
       used.  The normal printout for a user has percentage, pages,  files  and
       user  name.  When the quuestion SORT BY is output any one of the options
       listed in the COMMAND SUMMARY paragraph above may be entered.

       Any one answer may be given.  Account user would  sort  by  ACCOUNT  and
       within  an  account  by  user.   If  ACCOUNT  or  DISTRICT  is selected,
       subheadings are generated for each ACCOUNT/DISTRICT giving  the  ACCOUNT
                                                                        Page 17

       NUMBER/DISTRICT   NUUMBER.   The  number  of  pages  and  files  in  the
       ACCOUNT/DISTRICT and the percentage of the DISC these  represent.   Note
       that percentages are always of the next higher classification.  Thus, if
       the sort is by DISTRICT account size, the percentages for DISTRICTS  are
       percentages  of the entire DISC.  For each ACCOUNT, they are percentages
       of the DISTRICT the account is in.  For each user, they are  percentages
       of  the  storage in that account in that district.  If a sort on user or
       FILES precedes a sort on size, the percentages for  each  user  are  the
       percentage  of  the next higher category.  If SIZE precedes all FILE and
       user sorts, the percentages are cumulative percentages  since  the  last
       subheading.

       To list the options NUMACCOUNT, NAMEACCOUNT, and  NUMDISTRICT  you  must
       have  OPER or RF license.  The use of any of these will cause additional
       questions to be asked.  They will restrict printout to a single  account
       or  a  single district.  NAMEACCOUNT asks for the name of anyone in that
       account and will report any USER who is over quota.

       The Operator has the option to output the listing either to the PRINTER,
       DISC, or OPER TTY.

                               OUTPUT TO PRINTER
                               -----------------

       To output the listing to the PRINTER, the Operator must  first  type  in
       .AS  LPT  TTY.   The program will come back with LPT ASSIGNED as soon as
       the assign statement is entered.  The next input is .R SZRPT.   Enter  Y
       to  the  next  prompt.   This  tells the program that you want the USERS
       separated:  INHOUSE versus OUTHOUSE.  Your next prompt will be SORT BY?.
       Here  you  enter  your  option  from  the  list  in  the COMMAND SUMMARY
       paragraph above.  After the listing  has  completed  printing,  EXIT  is
       output  to  the OPER TTY.  Release the printer from the TTY by typing in
       DEAS.

                                OUTPUT TO DISC
                                --------------

       To output the listing to the DISC, the Operator must first type  in  .AS
       DSK  TTY.   The  program will come back with DSK ASSIGNED as soon as you
       enter the assign statement.  Follow the steps under the paragraph OUTPUT
       TO  PRINTER  for  your next entries.  After typing in DEAS you can print
       the listing to the printer from the filename LICRPT.LST.  If no  printer
       is  available,  the  file  can either be telecopied or put on a tape and
       printed on another system.

                              ------------------

       To output the listing to the OPER TTY no  assign  statement  is  needed.
       Just type in R SZRPT and enter commands as indicated above.
