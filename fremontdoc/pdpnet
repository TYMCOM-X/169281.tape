<TYMNET IS A GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED VIRTUAL CIRCUIT SWITCHING COMPUTER
NETWORK.
^CIRCUIT SWITCHING INVOLVES THE DICIPLINE OF UTILIZING PREESTABLISHED
PHONE LINE ROUTES BETWEEN EACH ENTRY POINT AND EACH
COMPUTER HOST. 
^IF ANY PATH BLOCKAGE, DETERIORATION OF SIGNAL QUALITY OR
OVERLOAD CONDITION DEVELOPS ALONG THIS 'PREFERRED ROUTE'
AN ALTERNATE PHONE LINE PATH FOR SUBSEQUENT TRAFFIC  CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY SUBSTITUTED BY THE
CENTRALIZED NETWORK CONTROL SUPERVISOR.
^THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE NETWORK
USES AN 'EXPANDED RING' STRUCTURE: THERE ARE TWO (OR MORE)
POSSIBLE PATHS TO ROUTE DATA FROM ANY POINT IN THE NET TO ANY DESTINATION
COMPUTER.
.SKIP 1

^SINCE <TYMNET BECAME FULLY OPERATIONAL IN 1971, IT HAS EXPANDED AND EVOLVED
INTO AN INTERNATIONAL DATA COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
WITH CONSIDERABLE SCOPE AND FLEXIBILITY.
^THE PRINCIPLE USE OF THE NETWORK HAS BEEN PROVIDING USERS WITH TIMESHARING
SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS.
^IT IS THEREFORE ORGANIZED AROUND A 'TERMINAL TO COMPUTER' TECHNOLOGY
INVOLVING LOW SPEED, FULL DUPLEX, VOICE GRADE COMMUNICATIONS LINES.
<TYMNET NULIFIES ANY GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCES BETWEEN THE USER AND
THE USER'S DATA.
^IN FACT, THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE USER'S DATA BECOMES
IRRELEVANT ONCE THE USER DIALS A LOCAL ROTOR NUMBER AND ACCESSES
THE NET.
^AN ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE OF THIS GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IS THE
ABILITY TO LEVEL USAGE LOADS ACROSS TIME ZONES: FOR EXAMPLE, DAYTIME ^EUROPEAN

<TYMNET ALSO INSULATES THE USER FROM PHONELINE ERRORS BY CHECKING

THE DATA IS DEFERRED UNTIL AN AUTOMATIC RETRANSMISSION OF CORRECT
DATA IS PERFORMED.
.SKIP 1

^THE ABILITY TO ACCOMODATE A VARIETY OF USERS REQUIRES THAT <TYMNET

TYMNET DEVELOPMENT
.skip 1
.indent 5
In 1969, a centrally directed network of Varian 620 mini-computers was developed
by Tymshare.
When the network became fully operational in 1971 it consisted of
30 nodes and a central supervisor (with 3 backup supervisors) that ran on an
SDS 940 computer system.  The network has since undergone a prolonged evolution
and has grown to over 300 NODES.
These nodes connect 90 domestic and international cities utilizing
over 50,000 miles of leased telephone lines, including two
independent trans-Atlantic cables and a trans-Pacific cable.
Over 4000 users perform a wide range of data processing activies on
95 large scale host computers tied into Tymnet.
The nodes (or TYMSATS) are equipped with hardware to handle up to
32 or 64 asynchronous low speed ports (110 - 1200 baud) and up to
12 synchronous ports (2400 - 9600 baud) and 4 bisynchronous ports
(2400 to 4800 baud).
Connected to the asynchronous ports are either Bell 103/113 modems or
Tymshare's equivalent MARK XV modems.
The TYMSATS are connected using Bell long Lines with Bell 
(201C, 202, 208, 209, 212, Bell's D.D.S. service) and Vadic modems.
Virtually every TYMSAT is connected with multiple phone lines
permitting alternate routing capability.
Routing within the nodes is done through routing tables
called permuter tables.
.PARA
Tymnet technology is moving into several new areas:
A major message switching system called ONTYME has been implemented
to provide mail storage and forwarding to a variety of user groups;
Design and production of a powerful network mini-computer called the
TYMNET ENGINE is underway to assume a major role in supervisor and
node hardware requirements of the future.

.CENTER
ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION
.skip 1
.indent 5
	A user connects his/her terminal to a host on the network by dialing
a local node.  After typing a character to identify his/her terminal
characteristics, the user enters his/her user name, host number and password.  This
information is sent, by the local node, to the network supervisor.  The supervisor verifies
the user's name in the Master User Directory (MUD) and then checks for a
correct password.
If the user did not specify a host number, his/her
standard "home" host number is taken from the MUD.
	The supervisor now knows the node which the user called (origination)
and the node to which he wishes a connection (destination).  The supervisor then
computes the minimum cost path for the virtual circuit.
Once a path has been plotted,
the supervisor allocates buffer pairs and permuter table positions in each node on the path to create
the virtual circuit.  Messages are sent to all nodes along the path to make the appropriate
permuter table entries.  This implicitly causes buffer assignments in the nodes.
Nodes send an acknowledgement to the supervisor after making a permuter table
entry.  Once all the acknowledgements are in, the supervisor sends the user name,
the user's status (from the MUD),
the originating node number and port number, and the terminal characteristics to the destination
node, plus a message to tell the attached host that there is a new login.
.PAGE
.INDENT 5
	The host may now read the user name to verify that this user name is valid
on this host.  No further checking is required!  All the security checking has
been done for the host, with access restricted to network personnel.
And all passwords are virtually invulnerable to theft.
This allows a host with minimal login security to be connected to the
network, with confidence that only authorized people may log in
through the network.  Additional log in security may, of course, be imposed
by the host computer system.

1. HOST NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH NET
   ------------------------------
.skip 1
   THIS MESSAGE INDICATES THAT THE SUPERVISORS ARE NOT AWARE OF
   THE HOST NUMBER THE USER REQUESTED. IT CAN OCCUR WHEN (1) THE 
   SUPERVISOR HAS NOT TAKEN OVER THE BASE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
   REQUESTED HOST (I.E., ITS BASE IS DOWN), OR (2) IF THE SUPER-
   VISOR IS IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING OVER ALL OR A PORTION OF THE
   NETWORK AND HAS NOT TAKEN OVER THE BASE OR HOST BEING
   REQUESTED.
.skip 1
2. HOST DOWN
   ---------
.skip 1
   THIS MESSAGE INDICATES THE BASE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REQUESTED
   HOST IS UP; HOWEVER, THE HOST ITSELF IS DOWN. THIS MESSAGE
   SHOULD ONLY OCCUR WHEN THE HOST IS TRULY DOWN.
.skip 1
3. HOST SHUT
   ---------
.skip 1
   THIS INDICATES THE BASE AND HOST ARE UP; HOWEVER, LINES
   HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED. CERTAIN USERS (IE. OPER) CAN STILL
   LOGIN WITH THE 'SHUT OVERRIDE' BIT. THIS WILL NOT AFFECT
   ANY USERS ALREADY LOGGED ON THE SYSTEM.
.skip 1
4. HOST OUT OF PORTS
   -----------------
.skip 1
   THIS MESSAGE INDICATES EVERYTHING IS UP AND OPERATIONAL;
   THERE ARE NO MORE PORTS AVAILABLE BETWEEN THE BASE AND HOST.
   IN OTHER WORDS, THE SYSTEM IS FULL.

5. CIRCUITS BUSY
   -------------
.skip 1
   THIS MESSAGE INDICATES EVERYTHING IS WORKING; HOWEVER, THERE
   IS NOT ENOUGHT CAPACITY BETWEEN THE USER AND SELECTED HOST
   TO COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT.  TRY A DIFFERENT PHONE NUMBER,
   OR WAIT AND TRY AGAIN LATER.

   DURING A SUPERVISOR TAKEOVER, LOG-INS ARE INHIBITED.
   THIS WAS DONE AS PART OF THE FIX TO PREVENT GARBAGE FROM
   ACCUMULATING IN THE NETWORK, AND THE HUNG USERS. DURING
   THE TWO TO FIVE MINUTES THE SUPERVISOR RETAKES THE NETWORK
   THE ABOVE MESSAGE WILL BE SENT.

NETWORK SUPERVISOR
.skip 1
.indent 5
	The network supervisor is a program that runs under a special
time sharing system on an Interdata 7/32.  The supervisor, like any piece of
software, and the 7/32, like any piece of hardware, are subject to failure.
Although failures are infrequent (on the order of one every 3 weeks) the absence
of a supervisor to build virtual circuits cannot be tolerated for very long.
To deal with this problem 4 potential supervisors exist in the network, only one
of which is active at any one time.  The active supervisor keeps the other
supervisors dormant by sending "sleeping pills" to them at regular intervals.
If the active supervisor fails, the operators at the network control center 
can immediately awaken one of the dormant supervisors.  Even without
human intervention, the dormant supervisors will notice the absence of the
active supervisor when they cease to receive "sleeping pills".  The various
supervisors have staggered 'drowsiness factors', at the end of which they will awaken
if no sleeping pills have arrived.  Thus, in case of a supervisor failure one of the dormant supervisors will
awaken and take control of the network.  It is possible for multiple supervisors
to be trying to take over the network simultaneously.  This situation is
resolved gracefully by the less dominant supervisor going to sleep when it
discovers the presence
of a more dominant supervisor.

NETWORK TAKEOVER
.skip 1
.indent 5
	In order to control nodes and carry out the supervisor's function of
building virtual circuits, the supervisor must know the capacity of all nodes,
their link capacities, the network topology and the value of every permuter
table entry in the network.
	A supervisor starting network takeover has no presupposed knowledge of
the network topology.  The supervisor first sends a takeover command to its own 
node, and learns of that node's capacity, the capacity of its links, every
permuter table entry in that node and the neighbors of that node on each
link.  The latter is the basis on which the supervisor discovers the topology
of the network.  The supervisor now sends takeover commands to each neighbor
of its own node.  As each of these nodes comes under complete control of
the supervisor, of its neighbors is checked to discover previously
unknown nodes, and these are in turn taken over.
	In this way the supervisor learns the topology of the network, all its
capacities and (from the permuter tables) which resources are in use.
In 1975 the supervisor running on the SDS 940 reached its capacity
and was replaced by a supervisor running on an Interdata 7/32, reducing
network takeover time from 15 minutes to 2.5 minutes.
The time determining factors
are the number of nodes, the bandwidth of links in the vicinity of the
supervisor, the number of permuter table entries and the
connectivity of the network vis-a-vis the supervisor's own node.  From a
control standpoint the supervisor views the network as a tree.
The control tree comprises a subset of the links in the network.
The balance and depth
of this tree is the measure of connectivity of the network in relation to the
supervisor's own node.
	If a previously non-operational link becomes operational it may reveal one or
more nodes that were previously inaccessible.  The supervisor would then
extend the control tree by taking over these newly discovered nodes.  On the
other hand, if a link that is part of the control tree goes out, the supervisor
loses control of the nodes in that subtree.  The control tree is then rebuilt to
regain control of all the lost nodes that are still accessible through the
network topology.
.skip 1
.indent 5
	The original TYMNET#I nodes allowed only 3 links per node.
Presently TYMNET#I nodes allow 16 links per node.  The cost of more links is increased CPU
and memory requirements for the node.  However, even 16 links per node will soon be inadequate
for the growth of TYMNET.  One solution to this problem is the use of node
clusters.  A node cluster is a group of 2 or more nodes in close proximity, interconnected by
an inexpensive high speed distributed memory transfer device.  We call this device a
"memory shuffler", and it is capable of data transfers at memory bandwidth
rates.  A fully interconnected eight node cluster at TYMNET's Cupertino
center, with 72 links to the rest of the network is planned.
This approach creates
a logically very large node (including two supervisor machines) that does not
change the fundamental logical structure of the network.

^SINCE THE ^TYMBASE PROVIDES NETWORK ACCESS TO
TWO HOSTS, IF EITHER HOST CRASHES, THE BASE
WILL CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AS A NODE IN ^TYMNET. 
^BUT FOR MOST BASE CRASHES, THE CHANCES ARE VERY GOOD THAT THE BASE
WILL CRASH THE PRIMARY HOST CONNECTED TO THAT BASE; A HOST WITHOUT A BASE IS 
CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND CANNOT TIMESHARE EFFECTIVELY.
^A LARGE MAJORITY OF BASE CRASHES WILL BE SELF-RECOVERING.

<PROBE IS THE ACCESS AND CONTROL PROGRAM FOR THE <TYMNET SUPERVISOR.
^IT IS A MAJOR SUBSYSTEM WHICH RUNS ON THE ^INTERDATA MODEL 7/32.
^THE PRIMARY OPERATOR FUNCTIONS IN <PROBE ARE:
.NOFILL.NOJUST
.SKIP 1
        1) TO DETERMINE THE GENERAL STATUS OF THE NETWORK;
.SKIP 1
        2) TO CHECK ON THE STATUS OF INDIVIDUAL NODES IN THE NET
           ESPECIALLY IF IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO RELOAD A NODE
           OR MOVE A HOST FROM ONE HARDWARE TO ANOTHER;
.SKIP 1
        3) TO ESTABLISH A CENTRAL LOGGER TERMINAL WHICH CAN
           EXTRACT INFORMATION OF INTEREST TO OPERATIONS ABOUT
           ALL THE SYSTEMS IN AN ENTIRE COMPUTER CENTER.
.SKIP 1
.FILL.JUST
.INDENT 5
^IN ADDITION, <PROBE CAN BE USED TO MANIPULATE THE USEAGE OF INDIVIDUAL
NODES AND LONG LINES, MOVE THE NETWORK SUPERVISOR FROM ONE
^INTERDATA TO ANOTHER, AND PERFORM OTHER ACTIVITIES VITAL TO THE
MAINTENANCE OF <TYMNET.
^FOR THE MOST PART, THESE ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES ARE WITHIN THE
DOMAIN OF <TYMNET <NETWORK <CONTROL <CENTER AND REQUIRE SPECIAL
STATUS.
^IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT <NETWORK <CONTROL BE INVOLVED AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE IN ANY OF THESE OTHER PROCEDURES.

                        in bits, and must lie between 1 and 8
                        inclusive.  When FILL=LEFT, bytes are
                        packed left justified and unused

                        If [sysno] is omitted, an existing circuit
                        will be used if one exists.  Once
                        the circuit has been established, the logged
                        in userid begins to accrue usage charges just
                        as if the userid had logged directly into the
                        remote system with his terminal.  Input from
                        the local terminal is passed along to the
                        remote system, and its terminal output is
                        directed to the local terminal, allowing the
                        user to converse with the remote system.
                        This feature will be needed to use TELECOPY

                        prior to file transfer.

                        Escapes typed at the local terminal will

                        possibility exists that the user may be detached
                        for up to 1/2 hour if the circuit is broken.
                        The recommended procedure for breaking such
                        a circuit is to use the TALK command
                        and to send a LOGOUT command to the remote
                        system.  The warning message "CIRCUIT REMAINS

                        breaking the TYMNET circuit.  The QUIT command

                        TALK connection to a TYMCOM X or TYMCOM

^in order to require confirmation of the replacement.  ^This question
must be answered <Yes or <No.  ^If the answer is <Yes, and file transfer
is between identical system types (except <TYMCOM 370's), or
is a binary mode transfer between dissimilar system types (but neither
is a <TYMCOM 370), then <TELECOPY will switch to <UPDATE mode and send
only blocks of the donor file which differ from blocks  in the destination
file.  ^In this case, <TELECOPY would have printed "'<UPDATING <STARTED'"
instead of "'<COPY <STARTED'".
.paragraph
^Two commands, <REPLACE and <KEEP, may be used to provide automatic
confirmation or rejection, respectively, of file replacement.  ^The
<KEEP command, for example, will cause <TELECOPY to retain any
existing files that would otherwise have been written over.  ^Still
another command, <ASK, restores the normal mode of requiring confirmation
from the terminal.  ^These commands are useful when creating commands
files and it is uncertain whether the files being copied will need
a '^Y' or '^N' response in the commands file.
.paragraph
^When <TELECOPY has finished copying the file, it will print a message
to this effect, including complete "<FROM" and "<TO" specifications.
<TELECOPY also prints the total number of 8-bit characters
transfered, and the number of <TYMNET characters transmitted
in parentheses.

^The second, and prefered, method of beginning program execution
is to type the "<FROM" and "<TO" filename specifications directly
