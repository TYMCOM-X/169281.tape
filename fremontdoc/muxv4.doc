                                 1 -  Using the MUX



                                 1.1  Introduction


           The MUX is a process which  resides in an ISIS slot and  allows a
        user  to  create and  communicate  with several  circuits  through a
        single (physical) terminal,  or circuit.  It  can be used  to build,
        interconnect, and control sets of circuits.

           Each user is allowed to control his own set of circuits; each set
        of circuits is associated with  a unique user name.  Your  user name
        is the name you used to log into the MUX, and this user name must be
        assembled into the code.  There is no way for another user to access
        or control another user's circuits.

           The  MUX  can  be  accessed by  multiple  users  each  having one
        controlling  or BOSS  circuit.   This circuit,  in  conjunction with
        different  MUX  commands,  is used  to  control  the  other circuits
        assigned to the user.

           Through the MUX a user :

              1.  Can have immediate access to more than 1 circuit.
              2.  Can  communicate   with  these  circuits   through  1
                  physical terminal (such as at home or on the road.).
              3.  Can telecopy between circuits.
              4.  Can  interleave  the  output  of  two  different  but
                  related circuits.  (So  that their times  relative to
                  each other may be viewed)
              5.  Can  retain  all  circuit  connections  regardless of
                  status of  controlling terminal.  For  example, other
                  circuits   remain   connected   although  controlling
                  circuit is zapped.
              6.  Can communicate with any other MUX user who is logged
                  in at the same time and who has the HEAR option on.
              7.  Selective output to a hard copy or CRT through use of
                  inter-circuit telecopy.

        Using the MUX                                         August 2, 1985


                                1.2  Operating Modes


           The MUX operates in three different modes. These are:

              A)  Command mode: where  the user's input (from  the boss
                  port) is taken as commands directed to the MUX.

              B)  Send mode: where all of the data entered at  the BOSS
                  port  (by the  user) is  sent along  the  user's SEND
                  port.  This looks like a normal network connection.

              C)  Talk mode:   in which one  user can talk  to another.
                  It  is not  necessary  for the  person  receiving the
                  message  to be  in talk  mode, but  the  receiver may
                  choose not to  be interrupted by talk  messages.  The
                  HEAR command is used to control whether or not a user
                  wants to receive talk messages.  This mode is  not as
                  transparent as send mode:  Certain control characters
                  are filtered out in order to protect the innocent.


                                1.3  Login Procedure


           To gain  access to  the MUX you  must first  have your  user name
        assembled into the MUX's local user directory.  Along with  the user
        name, the user's  default attention character (ATTN),  HEAR [on/off]
        status, and LABEL [on/off]  status is defined.  Once your  user name
        has been assembled in, you may log into the MUX just like  any other
        host  (i.e. username:999;password).   When you  log in  you  will be
        greeted by something like this:

              >>> MUX V4.00 - Host 999 <<<
              <some optional message>
              <list of ports (see LIST command)>

              &

           The version number is printed and therefore indicates  whether or
        not the MUX has changed since the last time you used it.

           The host number  is printed to verify  that you have  logged into
        the MUX that you wanted to.

           An optional greeting  message can be set  by use of  the GREETING
        command.  This message will be  output to each user only  once, upon
        the initial login after the message is set.

           If other  circuits are  still present from  a prior  login, these
        will be listed with the asterisk indicating the current send port.

        Using the MUX                                         August 2, 1985


           The MUX prints a prompt  character to inform the user that  he is
        in  command mode.   The  MUX prompt  character  can be  one  of four
        characters: "#", "$", "%", "&".  This character varies with the host
        number, and can be  used to distinguish between MUX's.   The formula
        for  determining the  prompt character  is based  on host  number as
        follows:

              evenly divisible by 4..........#
              (evenly divisible by 4)+1......$
              (evenly divisible by 4)+2......%
              (evenly divisible by 4)+3......&

           When you log into a MUX that circuit becomes the BOSS.   The BOSS
        is the only circuit that is allowed to issue commands to the MUX.

                                 2 -  MUX Commands



                               2.1  Types of Commands


           There are two types of MUX commands:  "command mode" commands and
        "immediate mode" commands.

           In command mode, you are talking directly to the MUX  (As opposed
        to  one  of your  user  circuits.)  The MUX  will  display  a prompt
        character on your screen to  indicate that it is waiting  for input.
        This is the mode that you start off in.

           Immediate commands are  entered using a special,  user definable,
        attention character  (ATTN), and are  effective only when  you're in
        Send mode.


                                2.2  Command Format


           Commands sent directly to the MUX have the following format:

              <command> <arg1> <arg2>...

              where

              <command>  is a valid MUX command or valid abbreviation
                         of a MUX command.  Commands may be entered
                         in either upper or lower case.

              <arg1>     is a set of arguments to the command (often
              <arg2>     optional) separated by blanks or commas,
                .        such as a port label, or an "OFF" or an "ON"
                .        string as a parameter to HEAR, LABEL, OR FREEZE,
                .        or terminal  parameter numbers for the TPAR
                         command.

           With  the facility  to enter  abbreviated commands,  the possible
        valid entries of,  for instance, the  HELP command are:   HELP, HEL,
        HE, and H.

           No  action  is  taken  on a  command  until  a  <cr>  is entered.
        Corrections can be made before the <cr> is typed by using <ctrl>A or
        <ctrl>H to erase the last  character and <ctrl>Q to erase  the whole
        line.  Multiple commands  may be entered  on one line  by separating
        the commands by a semicolon (;).

                            2.3  Informational Commands



                    2.3.1  HELP

           The HELP command prints a descriptive list of valid  MUX commands
        and a configuration  definable message.  The capitalized  letters of
        the  commands in  the  help list  define  the valid  version  of the
        command with the least number  of characters.  For instance, F  is a
        valid  command  entry for  FLUSH,  but  FR is  the  least  number of
        characters needed to be entered for a valid FREEZE command.


                    2.3.2  VERSION

           The VERSION  command will  display the  current version  and host
        number in the format:

              >>> MUX V4.00 - Host 999 <<<


                    2.3.3  WHO

           The WHO command displays the names of all of the  users currently
        logged in on the MUX.   Your user name is indicated by  an asterisk.
        Users  with their  HEAR option  on are  indicated by  an exclamation
        mark.


                    2.3.4  LIST

           The LIST command is used to list all of your active circuits.  If
        any circuits are built, the output format is:

              Port list:
              <port label1> <login string> <other info>
              <port labeln> <login string> <other info>

           For example:

              Port list:
              * .251  ausrnam:57
                MY39  myusrnam:39 (B)
                OT39  otherunm:39 --> .251


           If there are no circuits  built to ports, "No ports"  is printed.
        When constructing a normal  circuit the MUX automatically  assigns a
        label  in the  form:  ".XXX", where  XXX  is the  decimal  ISIS port
        number, unless the user assigns his own label when issuing  the MAKE
        command.  In  the example,  the first  circuit in  the list  has the

        label ".251".  The user did  not choose to assign a  label (although
        it could  be changed  later with  the ATTN-C  immediate command--see
        below).  The asterisk indicates the current port which is implicitly
        referenced by many commands when no argument is given.

           The login string following each port label shows the username and
        host number used for logging in.  The next item on the list, labeled
        by the user  as "MY39", has the  letter B in  parentheses indicating
        that the circuit  is backpressured.  A  letter F indicates  that the
        output  from that  circuit is  being "flushed"  or discarded,  and a
        letter T indicates that the circuit was built into the  MUX (assumed
        to be a user terminal).  The third item in the example has  an arrow
        after  the  log-in  string  followed  by  port  label  ".251".  This
        indicates that the output  from the circuit labeled "OT39"  is being
        switched to the circuit labeled ".251".  (This is made possible with
        the CONNECT command).

           In cases where the BOSS circuit is transferred, either by a later
        login  or by  the TRANSFER  command, the  old BOSS  is automatically
        labeled SLV.<port number>.


                    2.3.5  TIME

           The TIME  command prints  the date  and the  24-hour time  of day
        (i.e. 31Dec83 23:59).


                    2.3.6  MESSAGE

           Displays the  current system message.   The MUX has  the ability,
        through the GREETING command,  to broadcast a message, once  to each
        user, at  the time they  log in.  Typically  this is used  to inform
        users when the MUX is expected to be down, what the latest revisions
        are, etc.  This commands allows the user to read the  system message
        at any time.


                             2.4  Operational Commands



                    2.4.1  MAKE

           The MAKE  command is probably  the most frequently  used command.
        As it's name implies it is used to make a new circuit.

           The format of the instruction is:

              MAKE <user-defined label><cr>

           If a label is not specified, the MUX makes up a  label consisting

        of a period and the ISIS  port number, and displays it to  the user.
        After entry of ommand, the log-in prompt, "please log  in:", is
        printed, after which the user enters the log-in string:

              please log in:<username>:<host number>;<password><cr>

           After the circuit has  been built, you are connected  directly to
        it (send mode).  Any characters that you type, once the  circuit has
        been established, are now sent down the new circuit and  not treated
        as commands to the MUX.

           The  entire sequence  is as  follows (with  computer  response in
        UPPER-CASE):

              make <optional label><cr>
              PLEASE LOG IN:username:555;<password>
              WELCOME TO TYMSHARE SYSTEM 555.
              READY>_

           You  are  now   in  SEND  mode.    In  other  words,   you're  in
        communication with a host, and  everything you type will be  sent to
        it, and all of it's responses will be sent to you.

           The  only commands  which the  MUX will  respond to  now  are the
        immediate commands, entered by use of the attention character.


                    2.4.2  CHARACTER

           The CHARACTER command has  two separate functions: (1)  to inform
        the user of the current  setting of the attention character,  or (2)
        to change the attention character  to whatever the user wants  it to
        be.  The default, set at assembly time, is usually the  ESC (escape)
        character.

           If  the  command is  entered  with no  parameters,  the  MUX will
        display  the ASCII  representation of  the attention  character.  In
        this example, the character is a tilde:

              CHAR<cr>
              Attention char:  7E       [mux response]

           The  user  changes  the attention  character  by  entering,  as a
        parameter to  the command, the  ASCII code--in  hexadecimal--for the
        character he wants.   As an example, if  the user wanted to  set the
        attention character to be ESC, he would enter:

              CHAR 1B<cr>
              Attention char:  1B       [mux acknowledges command]

           If the attention  character is detected  while in SEND  mode, the
        MUX looks at  the next character and  checks it against the  list it

        has of immediate  commands.  If it does  not find a match  then both
        characters are discarded,  and normal processing continues.   If the
        second character is also  an attention character then  one attention
        character is sent.  If the second character is an  immediate command
        character then  that command is  executed (see section  on immediate
        commands).

           The only way that you can interrupt the normal sending of data on
        a circuit is with an immediate command.


                    2.4.3  SEND

           The SEND  command is  used to define  the destination  circuit or
        port you wish to communicate with.  The command has the format: SEND
        <port label><cr> where port label is the name of one of  your ports.
        If the port label is omitted, then the current send port  is assumed
        (the one with the asterisk in your port list).

           Using the LIST  command you can get  a list of your  port labels.
        For example if your list command resulted in:

              Port list:
                C39  c39name:39
              * PROBE  probname:39

              &

        And you wanted to send data or commands to the circuit that  you had
        labeled "C39", you would type "S C39<cr>", or "s c<cr>", etc.

           This will give  you a full-duplex path  that looks and  acts just
        like a  normal network  connection.  The only  exception to  this is
        that you  must enter the  attention character twice  if you  want it
        sent down the destination circuit once.

           In the example  above, typing "S<cr>"  would have you  sending to
        the circuit labeled "PROBE".


                    2.4.4  EXIT

           The EXIT command, in effect, zaps the boss port.  It has the same
        effect as disconnecting, or turning off your terminal.   Please note
        that all  of your  other non-boss circuits  will remain  intact.  An
        optional  port label  may be  specified to  transfer control  to the
        specified circuit after the  current boss is zapped.   The specified
        circuit must be  a circuit that  was built by  a log-in from  a user
        terminal.

                    2.4.5  QUIT

           The QUIT command zaps all  of the circuits assigned to  your user
        name.  This includes both the boss port and all of your user ports.


                    2.4.6  ZAP

           Zap any given port.  This command zaps the port specified  by the
        label  which  is  entered  as  a  parameter  to  the  command:   ZAP
        <label><cr>.  A zap command  with no parameter will zap  the current
        send port (the port flagged by an asterisk in your port list).


                    2.4.7  BACKPRESSURE

           Starts backpressuring on port.  If the command is entered  with a
        port label as a parameter (i.e., B <label><cr>), then backpressuring
        starts on that  port.  If the command  is entered with  no parameter
        (i.e., B<cr>), then backpressuring begins on the port that  was last
        in SEND mode.  (Indicated by the port label with the asterisk in the
        port list).


                    2.4.8  FLUSH

           Starts flushing or the discarding of output from a port.   If the
        command  is  entered with  a  port  label as  a  parameter  (i.e., F
        <label><cr>), then flushing starts on that port.  If the  command is
        entered with no parameter (i.e., F<cr>), then flushing begins on the
        port that was last in SEND mode.  (Indicated by the port  label with
        the asterisk in the port list).


                    2.4.9  ENABLE

           Turns off backpressuring or  flushing on given port.   If command
        is entered with  port label as  a parameter (i.e.,  EN <label><cr>),
        then action is  taken on that port.   If command is entered  with no
        parameter  (i.e.,  EN<cr>), then  action is taken  on port  that was
        last in SEND mode.  (Indicated  by the port label with  the asterisk
        in the port list).

                    2.4.10  FREEZE

           The FREEZE command has two separate functions:  (1) to inform the
        user whether or not the boss is frozen, or (2) to freeze or unfreeze
        the boss with [ON/OFF] as a parameter to the command.  The  MUX will
        accept  the  letter  N  as  an abbreviation  for  ON,  and  F  as an
        abbreviation for OFF.  Examples:

              FREEZE<cr>              [is the boss frozen?]
              Boss Freeze:  OFF       [mux response]

              FREEZE ON<cr>           [freezing boss]
              Boss Freeze:  ON        [mux acknowledges command]

           The FREEZE  ON command  locks the BOSS  circuit onto  the current
        BOSS port.  It informs the MUX that you want to retain  this circuit
        as the BOSS  even if another  circuit logs in  to the MUX  with your
        user name.  Under normal, default, conditions if you log into  a MUX
        with a user name that already has a boss associated with it  the MUX
        will recognize  the new log-in  as the BOSS  and down-grade  the old
        boss to a SLAVE.

           THE FREEZE OFF  command "thaws" the BOSS  port after a  FREEZE ON
        command has been  issued.  If the FREEZE  option is set to  OFF, any
        new ports logging in  with your user name will  automatically become
        the BOSS port.  This condition is the default.

           Also,  the TRANSFER  command  still works,  even if  the  boss is
        frozen.


                    2.4.11  TRANSFER

           TRANSFER  <port  label>,  Transfer  boss  circuit.   This command
        transfers control of your  boss circuit to the circuit  specified by
        <port label>.  The MUX will only allow you to transfer to ports that
        are logged in to the MUX, not those the MUX has built.   The current
        BOSS port will  become a SLAVE, and  the port specified will  be the
        new BOSS.


                    2.4.12  CONNECT

           Connect two circuits.  The format is:

              CONNECT <label  1> <label  2><cr>

           This command connects the output of the first circuit (designated
        by port label   1), to the input  of the second (designated  by port
        label  2).

           If you want a full duplex path you will need to issue two connect

        commands.   The  first  CONNECT A,B;  the  second  CONNECT  B,A.  To
        restore a  port to normal  operation you may  omit the  second <port
        label> and the MUX will reconnect that port to the BOSS.


                    2.4.13  LABEL

           The LABEL command has  two separate functions: (1) to  inform the
        user whether or not the labeling  option is on, or (2) to  allow the
        user to set the labeling option with [ON/OFF] as a parameter  to the
        command.  Examples:

              LABEL<cr>          [labeling option on or off?]
              Labeling:  ON      [mux response]

              LABEL OFF          [user turns label option off]
              Labeling:  OFF     [mux acknowledges command]

           The LABEL [ON] command directs the MUX to label output  sent from
        a port to the  boss.  The MUX first checks  to see if the  last data
        sent was also from the same port.  If it was, the MUX  simply passes
        the data on.   If the last data  sent was from a  different circuit,
        then the MUX prints the label of the new circuit, and then the data.

           The LABEL OFF command  stops circuit labeling; no labels  will be
        printed with data printed on the BOSS port.

           The LABEL ON/OFF status can  be established for each user  in the
        confguration parameter file.   The  MUX will accept the letter  N as
        an abbreviation for ON, and F as an abbreviation for OFF.


                    2.4.14  GREETING

           The GREETING command is  used for changing the  optional greeting
        message output to users at  login or with the MESSAGE  command.  The
        message only appears at login if  the user has not received it  at a
        prior login.  This command resets the flags which indicate this, and
        all users will get the new message at the next login.

           The format of the greeting message is:

              GREETING<cr>
              <...text...><cr>
              <cr>

        The text  string for the  message is terminated  by entry of  a null
        line (two carriage returns).  Single carriage returns allow multiple

        MUX Commands                                          August 2, 1985


                    2.4.15  TALK

           The TALK command allows one  user to talk to another user  if (1)
        the other  user has a  BOSS port  logged into the  MUX, and  (2) the
        other user  has the  HEAR option  set ON.   Valid recipients  can be
        found  by  using  the   WHO  command.   Usernames  listed   with  an
        exclamation mark by the WHO command are those with their HEAR option
        set ON.

           Once you have switched to  TALK mode, the only way to  leave TALK
        mode is with the ATTN-Z immediate command.  All other characters are
        sent to the other user.

           When  the  user  enters  talk mode,  the  talk  prompt  <TALK> is
        displayed after each carraiage return.  The talk message is  sent to
        the  recipient line  by line.   Each line  sent is  preceded  by the
        display, on the recipient's terminal, of your username followed by a
        colon.  This lets the recipient know who is talking to him.

           The format of the command is: TALK <username><cr>

           "User1" talking to "user2" would look like this:

              TALK user2<cr>
              <TALK>hello user2<cr>
              <TALK>hello again<cr>
              <TALK><ATTN-Z>        [leave talk mode]
              &                     [normal prompt]

              This talk from user1 would look like
              this on user2's terminal:

              USER1:hello user2
              USER1:hello again

        If the  user you  want to  talk to is  not logged  in, the  MUX will
        respond with '?  User not logged in';  if the user's HEAR  option if
        set to OFF, the MUX will respond with '? User hearing off'.


                    2.4.16  HEAR

           The HEAR command  has two separate  functions: (1) to  inform the
        user of the current status of  the HEAR option, or (2) to  allow the
        user  to  hear or  not  hear talk  from  another user  by  using the
        [ON/OFF] parameter with the HEAR command.

           HEAR ON  allows other users  to TALK to  you.  HEAR  OFF prevents
        other users  from using  the TALK command  to communicate  with you.
        HEAR  status  is  initialized for  each  user  in  the configuration
        parameter file.

        MUX Commands                                          August 2, 1985


           The MUX will accept the letter N as an abbreviation for ON, and F
        as an abbreviation for OFF.


                    2.4.17  TPARAMETER

           The TP command allows  the setting of terminal parameters  at the
        BOSS circuit's Tymsat.  The format is:

              SET <type> <value><cr>

              where
                   type  =  the decimal parameter type
                   value =  the decimal value

           What these types and values are can be found in ISIS.DOC.


                    2.4.18  CCT

           The CCT command--Circuit Character Type--has two  functions:  (1)
        to inform the user of the current circuit character type and  of the
        throughput  class, or  (2)  to allow  the  user to  set  the circuit
        character type and  the throughput class.  The  informational format
        of  the  command  is:   CCT<cr>.   The  operational  format  is: CCT
        <cctype> <tc><cr>, where cctype  is the circuit character  type, and
        tc  is the  throughput  class.  These  paramters apply  only  to new
        circuits built by the MUX.


                              2.5  Immediate Commands


           Immediate  commands  are  one  (1)  character  commands  that are
        preceded by  your attention  character.  Many of  them are  valid in
        some modes, but not others.


                    2.5.1  ATTN-ATTN

           The  simplest  of  immediate commands:  The  user  must  type two
        attention characters in order  to send one attention  character down
        the current circuit.

        MUX Commands                                          August 2, 1985


                    2.5.2  ATTN-Z

           Return  to  command  mode.  This  command,  valid  in  all modes,
        returns you  to command  mode, and prints  the prompt  character and
        waits for you to enter a MUX command.  This is used to get back into
        command mode so  that you can make  a new circuit, look  at existing
        circuits, look at who is logged in, etc.


                    2.5.3  ATTN-G

           Switch to New  Circuit.  This command,  only valid in  send mode,
        will cause you to "SEND" to the next port that you have defined, and
        print  that port's  label.  The  MUX treats  your list  of  ports as
        circular so that if you type ATTN-G consecutively, enough times, you
        will end up on the port you started from.  If you only have one user
        port defined you  will remain sending to  that port, but  it's label
        will be printed.


                    2.5.4  ATTN-E

           Same as ATTN-G except turns off backpressuring or flushing on the
        port the user is leaving--if flushing or backpressuring was set.


                    2.5.5  ATTN-B

           Backpressure, and advance to next port.  This command  also moves
        you  to the  next port  (as  does the  ATTN-E command)  but  it also
        applies  backpressure to  the port  you had  been sending  to.  This
        command is only valid when in send mode.


                    2.5.6  ATTN-F

           Flush, and advance  to next port.   This command is  identical to
        the ATTN-B command except that instead of applying  back-pressure to
        the old port, it places it into flush mode, where all  data received
        from that port is ignored.


                    2.5.7  ATTN-D

           Display port label.  Only valid in send mode.

        MUX Commands                                          August 2, 1985


                    2.5.8  ATTN-C

           Circuit Labeling.  This command takes the next 15  characters (or
        up to  the <cr> if  that occur  first) and creates  a label  for the
        current SEND circuit.  ATTN-C works only in send mode.

           Circuits may be labeled/relabeled at any time, except  during the
        login for a new circuit.  The label assigned is printed when  you do
        any of the following:

              ATTN-E
              ATTN-G
              ATTN-B
              ATTN-F
              LIST
              LABEL
              when a circuit is zapped


                    2.5.9  ATTN-N

           Sends user name out on circuit.  This command, recognized in send
        mode,  sends the  user  name, followed  by  a colon  (:),  along the
        circuit.  Very convenient for login dialogues.

                          3 -  Operations Monitor via DDT


           As an operations  monitor facility, it  is possible, via  DDT, to
        examine which ports of a MUX slot have circuits under the control of
        which user name.  While in  DDT, this facility is accessed  with the
        query  status  or ?STAT  command.   After entering  ?STAT,  the user
        enters CIR.  To leave query  status mode, the user enters Q.   As an
        example,  the  circuit  information displayed  and  the  sequence of
        commands to get the information would look like this:
