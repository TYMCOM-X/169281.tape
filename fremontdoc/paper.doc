        I. Overview of the Network Operations PAPER Ticketing System

           A. Purpose

              The ticket program is a method of tracking BT TYMNET
              network anomalies from the time they are reported 
              until their resolution.

              The system includes an archive database in order to
              provide and track historical information on a particular
              problem/trouble/anomaly/project/preventive maintenance.

              It allows multiple users and service groups to access
              and interact with a uniform format for the purpose of
              tracking network issues.

           B. History

              The ticket system originated at NSSC, the Network
              Systems Support Center which monitors and maintains
              the private and subnetworks of BT Tymnet.
                
              The name of the ticketing system is PAPER.
              Pre-1984, network problems that were documented
              by the Network Systems Support Center (NSSC)
              were written on paper forms called tickets. 
              All the steps that were taken to resolve a
              problem were written on the form.  When the
              issue was resolved, the tickets were filed
              for possible future reference.
              Don Murtaugh; then manager of Network Operations
              wrote a program to enable the technicians to
              utilize a relational database on a PDP10
              instead of writing paper tickets. 
                                                                  
                                                                   
              Used originally by only a few  technicians that
              comprised NSSC,  PAPER has evolved into a worldwide
              ticketing system utilizing a relational database.



              


                                                                            







           C. Who Uses the Ticket System?

              PAPER originally was used only by NSSC, but even-
              tually it became a ticketing system for all U.S. 
              Network Operations groups. The Field Engineering
              organization was later given ability to insert
              statuses, including the U.S. Novadyne Computer
              Systems, Inc.   After a time, communications
              specialists, project managers, and eventually, ATT
              management, and customers were validated to view 
              and update tickets.  The list of valid users was
              then expanded to include Software Technical Support
              (STS), National Technical Support(NTS), National
              Technical Development(NTD), Project Implementation
              (PI), and finally, International Operations Groups, 
              and Support Personnel.   

              PAPER is now a worldwide ticketing system.  The status
              of users varies with the highest status  going to a
              'control group'.  A control group is an operations
              organization that can open and close tickets in addition
              to statusing and transferring tickets between refer groups.
              The user of a non-control group has the restriction of not
              opening or closing tickets.  


           D. Ticket Structure and Types

              A PAPER ticket consists of:  

                1. Header - which contains three columns of
                   information about the particular aspect of the
                   network that the ticket is referencing. (The
                   header is covered in full in section II.)
                   Some of the information in the header is entered
                   at the time a ticket is opened.  Some header
                   information is kept in a relational database. The
                   relational database will add the information to
                   the header of the ticket each time a new ticket is
                   opened on that particular network aspect.

                   Example:  The first time a ticket is opened
                             on host 123 of slot 1 of Node 11430 the
                             technician will be prompted to enter the
                             name of a contact at the node site.  Every
                             time thereafter that a ticket is opened on
                             host 123 or node 11430 the site contact
                             will automatically appear in the ticket 
                             header.


                                                                            






                2. Problem Description - appears just below the
                   ticket header and consists of a maximum of 10
                   lines of a brief description of the anomaly 
                   and any diagnostics or suggestions toward
                   resolution.

                3. Each  status consists of  up to 4 lines of
                   information in the steps toward resolution. A
                   status also contains information automatically
                   entered by the program such as,  the control 
                   group, the initials of the person entering the
                   status, the date, GMT time.

                4. PAPER recognizes 3 types of tickets in the following
                   categories:

                   Node    Host    Circuit

           E. Problems with the PAPER Ticket System

              Report any problems with the PAPER program to the
              control group handling the ticket.  The control 
              group will resolve the problem or refer it to 
              Network Control for resolution.

           F. Caution

              At NO TIME should a username or password appear
              any place in a ticket!

    A. NETWORK
         
       1. In the ticket system each network is assigned a number.
          Use this number whenever prompted for 'network number'.
              
          A list of the networks follows and can also be found in
          Appendix A.

       2. On the following page the networks have been arranged 
          in alphabetical order for quick reference; the ticket
          system lists the networks in numeric order.

       3. All public network tickets are opened under Network #1
          for Tymnet.

    B. NODE TKT#

       1. This is the system ticket number assigned automatically.
          There are numerous groups with the capability of
          opening tickets.  The numbers are assigned at the 
          time the ticket is opened (originated) in numerical 
          order, regardless of the group that has opened it.



    C. NODE #

       1. Can be up to 5 digits and must be assigned.  A node
          number must be greater than zero.

       2. In the case of a ticket for an internodal link, use
          the low node number in the node pair.

    D. KERNAL

       1. The kernal host that is assigned to the subject node.

    E. HOST

       1. The host number within the slot if opening with 'H'
          option. If opening ticket as an internodal link, the 
          host field will come up as 'HI NODE # and will be the
          higher node number of the node pair.

    F. SLOT

       1. If using the 'H' option when opening a ticket for a
          host problem, the SLOT field will appear.  Enter the
          identifying software slot number the host resides in.

    G. PORTS

       1. Will only be in the header if ticket is opened as a host
          ticket using the 'H' option. Enter the identifying port
          number.
                
       2. If problem with the slot is a specific port, the port 
          number will be entered here.

    H. PRODUCT

       1. Assigned according to what product has the trouble.

       2. Product IDs are divided into 4 categories: ACCESS,

    N. SEVERITY

       1. Severity is 1,2,3,4, which reflects the severity level 
          of the problem; to be determined by the guidelines
          which can be found in Appendix D.
            
       2. The severity will determine when the problem will be
          escalated and how often the ticket will have to be
          updated (statused).

       3. Once the 'time up' or RESOLVE TIME (see 'W' this section)
          has been set, it is not necessary to change the severity.
          For example, if a node crashes and is reloaded but a 
          hardware dispatch to run diagnostics is desired the resolve
          time will be set up, but the severity of the ticket still
          remains a 1.

    O. STATE

       1. The state of the ticket will be:

          OPEN
          MONITOR
          TRACK
          CLOSED

          A. OPEN    - The ticket is in an active state.  
                                
          B. MONITOR - The problem/outage has been resolved but
                       there is a need to document a recurrence 
                       without opening a new ticket.

          C. TRACK   - When a ticket is being used for documentation;
                       activity is not expected.  Also for
                       documentation of future dispatches or releases.
                       MTTR* report is not affected.
                       *(Mean Time To Repair)

          D. CLOSED  - Ticket is inactivated and ready to be sent
                       to the archive database. Anomaly is resolved
                       and verified.






                   
     
    P. CONTROL GROUP

       1. The group that has opened the ticket will appear here.
          It is this group's responsibility to track the problem
          through resolution and close with the person/group
          that appears in the 'Reported By' field.
           
       2. The control group's are: NCS, NSSC, VANCF, or NETCON, but

          Area".
         
       2. This field indicates who is to be currently working
          on the trouble.  

       3. These fields can be found in APPENDIX C with an 
          explanation of each abbreviation. 
            
          Example: The field engineer in New York might be
          dispatching on a trouble ticket.  The "Referred To"
          would read 'EFONY' which stands for Eastern Field 
          Operations New York.



     R. MGMT ESCAL  - (Management Escalation)

        1. Indicates if the ticket has been escalated.

        2. H1 would indicate no escalation within hardware.
           H2 would indicate an escalation to first level manager
           in hardware.
           S1 is the escalation field for software
           T1 is the escalation field for TELCO (telephone Company)

     S. TECH ESCAL  - (Technical Escalation)

        1. Defaults to NO.

        2. If a ticket is escalated to STS (Software Technical 
           Support) or NTS ( National Technical Support), the 
           field will become a YES and remain YES even after
           the ticket is referred to another group.





     T. DE-ESCAL CODE

        1. Defaults to 0

        2. If a ticket is de-escalated, the technician is prompted
           for a de-escalation code which will appear in this field
           either while a ticket is open or after it is closed.
        
     U. DEFER

        1. If there is not to be any action taken on a ticket
           (that is open with resolve time not set),  the ticket
           must be deferred to prevent the  accumulation of 
           elapsed time on the Mean Time To Repair.

        2. The field appears as #/#.

           The first number is the amount of time that the
           ticket is currently deferred in number of hours.

           The second number is the amount of cumulative 
           deferred number of hours. 

        3. See Appendix E for a list of instances in which
           you can defer a ticket.


     V. OPEN

        1. The date and time the problem was resolved or when
           service was restored. The outage time for the ticket
           is stopped at the time entered in this field.
            
        2. The service may be restored and the ticket can remain
           open. 

           Example:  Service is restored but diagnostics
           are scheduled for the node. If service is restored the
           resolve time should be set.

           When service is believed to be restored, but a period of
           time must pass before the customer can test and verify,
           set the resolve time to when the current restoration
           activity was completed.  When the customer can test (often
           the next morning) and they find restoration not complete,
           simply re-open the ticket as explained in section VIII C.

       IV. OPENING A TICKET
   
           A. OBTAINING A TICKET HISTORY

              Before opening a ticket check the ticket history! This 
              will help in the diagnosis of the problem.  Also, if 
              the same problem has occurred two times with in the past 
              30 days, it is considered chronic on the third occurrence
              and may require a higher severity.

              1. Ticket history must be put in the opening status of 
                 a ticket.

              2. Type 'N' for history. The following will appear:         

              THIS COMMAND WILL DISPLAY TICKETS EVER CREATED BY TOPIC.
              THE TOPICS ARE...
                1 = CIRCUIT NUMBER
                2 = NODE + NETWORK
                3 = HOST = NUMBER

              ENTER THE NUMBER

              3. Choose 1,2,or 3; the system will then prompt user for
                 a network number.

              ENTER THE NETWORK NUMBER OR A ZERO (0) FOR HELP :
                
              4. See Appendix A for an alphabetical list of the
                 networks or type a zero to get a numeric list.
        
              5. The system will prompt for a node or host number.
                 If option #1 for circuit number is chosen, the
                 system will not prompt for the network as all 
                 circuit numbers are unique.

              6. If there are open tickets or tickets not moved to
                 the archive database the ticket numbers will now
                 appear on the screen. 

              7. After checking the current database, the program
                 will ask if you want to look at old tickets:

              DO YOU WANT TO OPEN THE OLD DATABASE?







              8. Enter 'Y' or 'N'
                 A "Y" will list all current and historical tickets
                 that may be related to the current network problem.

              9. Check the current tickets and the old tickets of
                 the past 30 days by doing an 'L' for Look. Enter
                 the ticket number when prompted.

             10. Use the history of problems for information in
                 your ticket opening status.


           B. 'A' Command

              1. Type an 'A' to open a ticket - 'A' indicates Add.

               DO YOU KNOW THE NODE NUMBER, HOST NUMBER OR CIRCUIT NUMBER?
                  ENTER N,H,C ? :

                 Indicate whether ticket is being opened by node,
                 host, or circuit (line). If the problem involves a 
                 circuit or link, use C. If a slot is involved, use 
                 the H for host and get a host number from the slot 
                 or the tymfile. For node problems use N.

                 The system will then prompt for the node, host 
                 or circuit number.

               ENTER THE NETWORK NUMBER OR A ZERO(0) FOR HELP :
        
              2. See Appendix A for the network names in 
                 alphabetical order - or type a zero for a list 
                 of the networks by number.

              3. The program will search for currently open tickets
                 on the node, host or circuit. If there are open 
                 tickets a listing of ticket numbers and a summary 
                 of information such as date, node, host, circuit, 
                 product ID will appear.

              4. A review of the current tickets will help determine
                 if a new ticket needs to be opened.  The program
                 will inquire if opening a new ticket should continue.






                 Indicate whether or not to 'ADD YOUR CONTACT TO THIS
                 TICKET'S CALL BACK LIST'.  Answer 'Y' or 'N'.  If 'N',
                 the program will go on to #5.  If 'Y',  your name and
                 number (after entering them) will appear in the ticket
                 header and you will be called when the problem is
                 resolved.

              5. If there are no current tickets or the program is told
                 to open a new ticket, the new ticket number will appear.
                   
              6. The ticket system will look for information already
                 entered into the system by a previous ticket on
                 this particular node, host, or circuit.

                 If a ticket has never been opened on this trouble you
                 will be prompted through each field.

                *There are, however, some fields which you will have
                 to enter information each time a new ticket is opened.


                 See Section II for complete description of the ticket
                 header for the information to be entering.

                 ENTER TIME OR C.R. FOR current time will show here.

              7. A carriage return here will enter the current GMT
                 time as the time the ticket was opened.  If the 
                 outage occurred other than now, type in the time of
                 the outage in GMT.

               **This is important to accurately calculate the amount 
                 of time it takes to repair the trouble.  

                 Example: If XRAY indicates a node crashed and recovered 
                          an hour previous, enter that time here.








              8. After the required information has been entered, the
                 program will prompt for a:

                 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

                   10 lines are allowed to describe the problem.
                   Be sure to include the following information:
                   The location, if different than LOCALE in header.
                   How the problem was discovered.
                   A description of the problem.
                   All troubleshooting done. Results of any testing.
                   Possible resolutions.
                   Related ticket history of past 30 days.
                   What group or person the ticket is being turned
                   over to for resolution. (See Appendix C for 
                   REFER groups)
                   In the case of a dialup access problem, indicate
                   whether the problem was duplicated in the 
                   troubleshooting process. Also indicate an alternative 
                   dialup number that the customer can use.
                   For circuit tickets or internodal links include 
                   the following:
                   Diagnostic address or if applicable,
                   addresses and phone numbers and site contacts for
                   both ends of an internodal link. (Needed for
                   site testing or dispatch)
                   Address of the 'drop' for multidrop problems.


              9. When finished with the opening status, type a
                 period in the far left hand margin and a carriage
                 return to continue to the final steps of opening
                 a ticket.
                   
                 ENTER THE NUMBER FOR THE GROUP WITH THE PROBLEM
                          OR ENTER A ZERO FOR HELP :     
                  
             10. Choose what group the ticket is being referred
                 to for resolution.
                 See Appendix C for description of REFER groups.

                 SEVERITY

             11. The severity reflects the impact the problem
                 has on the customer.
                 See Appendix D for complete descriptions
                 and examples of severity levels. 1,2,3,4.








                 COMMENT(20 CHAR. MAX):

             12. Enter a brief description of the trouble using up 
                 to 20 characters.  This description will show up 
                 when doing an N or an O command.

                 
             13. The last thing the program does is search the
                 ticket history for recent outages and automatically
                 enters the results of that search as a ticket status.

           C. REVIEWING WHAT YOU HAVE DONE

              1. At this point the ticket header can be reviewed
                 to see if changes need to be made to any of the 
                 fields.  Since some information might already be 
                 in the ticket from previous openings, it is important
                 to be sure all fields are correct.

              2. If service has been restored, i.e., the slot 
                 restarted, the node has been reloaded, set the
                 'timeup' or resolve (RESLV) time.
                      
                 Do this by issuing the 'S' command and then
                 choosing #10 from the menu.  Type a period in
                 the left hand margin and a carriage return, and 
                 when prompted, enter the time that service was
                 restored.
                 Note: Time up can also be set by using the 'G' command 
                 or by entering the date and time separately. Use the
                 G command to set time up if the date up is different
                 from the current date.

           D. CHANGING THE TICKET HEADER

              1. THE 'G' COMMAND

                 To change any of the fields in the header type 
                 a 'G'; the following list of fields will appear:

















     THIS COMMAND WILL ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE AN ITEM IN AN ENTIRE TICKET
         1 = SUPPORT AREA    2 = PRODUCT TYPE
         3 = SEVERITY        4 = CIRCUIT NUMBER
         5 = TROUBLE NUMBER  6 = SITE CONTACT
         7 = SITE PHONE      8 = NODE NUMBER
         9 = HOST NUMBER    10 = SLOT NUMBER
        11 = REPORTED BY    12 = CALL BACK #
        13 = CONTROL GROUP  14 = DATE UP
        15 = TIME UP        16 = DATE DOWN
        17 = TIME DOWN      18 = ELAPSED TIME (AFTER CLOSING TIC.)
        19 = COMMENT        20 = REFERENCE NUMBER
        21 = CUSTOMER       22 = TECH SUPPORT
        23 = PRODUCTION STATUS 24 = TOP 40 STATUS
        25 = BILLABLE       26 = PORTS
        27 = LOCATION       28 = KERNAL HOST
        29 = CONTRACT       30 = START HOUR
        31 = END HOUR       32 = VERSION
        33 = LONODE         34 = HINODE

                 See Appendix G for further information on the
                             fields in this list.

                 Enter the number of the field you want to change
                 and then the ticket number and the system will
                 display what is now in the header and ask you
                 to type in your change.


                                                                           






         V. MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS AND BILLABLES

            A. MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS

               Categorized as B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 and A

               Customers are charged according to the above plans.
               See Appendix F for a complete description.
               For instance B2 is maintenance service provided
               Monday through Friday 08:00 to 24:00 local time.
               Outside of this maintenance period the customer is
               billed - see below.

               The ticket header has a field for entering the
               maintenance plan. When using the G command enter
               a #29 to change it.

            B. BILLABLE

               If a customer requests maintenance outside of
               the maintenance contract they are informed
               that the dispatch is billable.

               A Billable Service Call form is filled out 
               by the technician.

               When the field engineer has dispatched to the 
               site, the needed information is received, such
               as time of travel to site, parts used and arrival
               and departure times. This is then entered on the 
               billable form and submitted to the appropriate BT
               Tymnet person.

               Other reasons for Billable Calls:

               Customer has caused the problem.
               No trouble found. 
               Customer moved equipment and is requesting reinstallation.
               Customer has denied access to the site after
               the Field Engineer has dispatched.
               Dispatch occurred during contract covered period but
               customer requested Field Engineer remain on site 
               after covered period.



                                                                             






        VI. ESCALATIONS

            A. Managerial escalations are made to all BT Tymnet and third
               party support groups following specific time frames to
               guarantee the quality of service provided to the customer.

               'Escalate' means that the network technician makes a
               phone call to the superior of the person assigned to
               the ticket (support group). The technician informs the
               superior of the ticket and of the non-resolution or
               non-status of the problem.

               If the superior cannot be reached, the next higher level
               of management is informed.

            B. Time frames for escalation vary according to the severity
               level that has been assigned to the ticket. They are as 
               follows:


                    SEVERITY      STATUS EVERY        ESCALATE AFTER

                      1              2 hours             4 hours
                      2              4   "              12   "    
                      3             12   "              24   "
                      4             24   "              at control group
                                                        manager's discretion
        
               1. Whatever support group  the ticket is assigned to
                  for resolution must provide status according to
                  the time frame for that severity. 
                            
                  Example: The ticket is a severity 2 and is over to 
                           Novadyne to dispatch and perform maintenance.
                           The support group should provide status at 
                           least every 4 hours.
        
               2. The problem should be resolved within the 'ESCALATE'
                  time frames above.  A severity 3 must be resolved
                  within 24 hours or it is escalated.


            C. When an escalation is instituted the technician does
               the following:

               1. Issue the command 'E' in the ticket system.
                  Or '7' after an 'S'. See Section VI

               2. Enter ticket number when prompted.








               3. The program will then want to know what type
                  of escalation is being performed.  

                  The screen prompt is:

               WHICH DISCIPLINE WAS THE ESCALATION PERFORMED UNDER ?
                     1 = HARDWARE
                     2 = SOFTWARE
                     3 = TELCO
                     4 = CUSTOMER
               ENTER SELECTION :


               4. The next prompt will be for the level of escalation:
 
               ENTER THE LEVEL OF SOFTWARE ESCALATION THAT YOU HAVE PERFORMED..
                     1 = NONE
                     2 = DISTRICT
                     3 = REGIONAL
                     4 = DIRECTOR
                     5 = EXEC. DIR.
                     6 = VICE PRES.
               ENTER THE NUMBER :
                   
                  The final prompt is for the name of the person
                  escalated to and the time of escalation.


            D. Supporting commands related to escalation.

               1. '2' lists, the tickets currently open and escalated.

               2. '9' lists the time the last status was added to the 
                  ticket.

               3. '6' is not used at this time.

               4. '8' will create a file of all of the tickets currently 
                  closed but had been escalated to STS during the 
                  repair cycle.








               5. Commands that advise when to escalate.  

                  '71','72','73','74','75','76','77','78'- Will list tickets
                  according to severity levels that are due for escalation,
                  status update, have no time set up, or have been on monitor
                  for more than 24 hours.
              
                  a. The commands are listed below with the control 
                     to which they correspond:

                     70 All groups
                     71 NSSC
                     72 NETCON
                     73 VANCF
                     74 Cust Serv
                     75 NETOPS
                     76 NETQC
                     77 BTAUS
                     78 ENOPS
                     79 ORDPR


                 



                                                                             






        VII. DEFERMENTS

             A. Deferring a ticket means the technician is stopping
                the 'clock from ticking' on the repair time of the
                ticket.
                This means ---
                    1. If a ticket is opened on a trouble/problem and
                       the time of resolution is not set up, a timer
                       is logging the time it will take to repair the
                       problem.  This information is used to calculate
                       the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).  MTTR is an
                       indication to operations groups and customers
                       as to how quickly anomalies are being resolved
                       or repaired.

                    2. Once the RESOLVE time is set in the ticket header,
                       the repair time clock will stop.

                    3. If there is an uncontrollable reason preventing 
                       maintenance or repair, the repair time clock needs
                       to be stopped temporarily.

                    4. The repair time clock is stopped by deferring the
                       ticket.

             B. Reasons for Deferment

                1. No access to the customer site.

                2. Customer has requested the repair be delayed.

                3. Outside of customer's principle maintenance
                   period.
                   See - Appendix F and Section V. of this 
                   document for more information on billing and
                   maintenance periods.

             C. Deferring a ticket

                1. There are two commands to defer a ticket.
        
                   a. 'D'
                   b. '8' after issuing an 'S'



                                                                            




                      'D'
                      Will prompt for a ticket number.
                      Then give a three choice menu:
 
                           1 = REDUCE DEFERMENT (ENTER NEGATIVE TIME)
                           2 = ZERO OUT DEFERMENT
                           3 = DEFER TICKET ACTION

                      Choose one of the above, and, if appropriate, the
                      program will prompt to enter the number of hours.
                    
                      Note: The maxium hours allowed for a single deferment
                            is 144 hours.  If additional deferment is
                            needed, repeat the process.

                      Typing an 'S' and then choosing #8 from the menu 
                      will accomplish the same thing as a D, but will
                      allow the technician to first enter a ticket status. 

                2. The ticket header 'DEFER' will reflect the number
                   of hours the ticket is currently deferred and the
                   number of total hours the ticket has been deferred.
                 - See Section III U.

                   Additionally, The ELAPS:  Elapsed time is calculated
                   from the time the ticket is opened.  If a ticket
                   is deferred, the effect on elapsed time will not
                   be affected while ticket is open.  Deferral times
                   are used to determine elapsed time at the time a 
                   ticket is closed.


                             See also Appendix E.




                                                                             









         VIII. Statusing a ticket and the 'S' command

               A. A 'status' is information entered into the ticket
                  system.

                  4 lines of text are allowed in a normal status.

                  Every action taken on a ticket must be entered 
                  as a status.

                  Statusing a ticket must be done when an action
                  is taken or information obtained.  The ticket
                  system enters:

                  1. The GMT time of the entry
                  2. The date of the entry
                  3. The initials of the person entering the status, 
                  4. The Control group - or support group to which
                     the person belongs.
                  5. A sequential number assigned to the status, ie
                     #1,#2 etc.

               B. A typical status looks like this:

     --# 2 STATUS ENTERED FROM NSSC       BY BVS ON 19-JUL-90 @07:32ZULU.
                       REPORT SENT YET?: YES    (311954)
   THE NETWORK CONTROLLER IS REPORTING A NR ON ADDRESS 1/107/1/01 AT 06:55Z.
    CALLED DISCO AND TURNED THE PROBLEM OVER TO BEV.  DISCO TICKET #13935.

                  1. A person from NSSC entered this status with the
                     initials BVS at 07:32z on July 19th on ticket
                     #311954.

                  2. There is one previous status, therefore, this one
                     is numbered 2.

                  3. Only pertinent information is entered. Under no
                     circumstance should editorial comments or personal
                     opinions be entered into a ticket.
                     

 
                                                                            
 
 
 
             
               C. Type 'S' to status a ticket.  After responding to the
                  prompt for the ticket to be statused, a menu similiar
                  to the one below will appear.


               CUSTOMER; IMMIGRATIONS       NODE   2110    PROD: 9.6
                      TICKET # 311954 IS CURRENTLY OPEN.
                      WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO WITH IT?
                                1 = ADD STATUS
                                2 = PUT ON MONITOR
                                3 = CLOSE TICKET
                                4 = REOPEN TICKET
                                5 = MAKE NO CHANGE
                                6 = ENTER TICK MARK
                                7 = ENTER ESCALATION
                                8 = DEFER TICKET
                                9 = TRACK
                               10 = SET TIME UP ONLY
                               11 = DE-ESCALATE THE TICKET
                               12 = ADD LONG STATUS
              ENTER #
        
              #1 is to add a new status.
                (Explanation of the rest of the options will follow.)

                Enter the number 1 and the screen will look like 
                this:

              TICKET STATUS
                Type in your 4 line status.  If you use less than
                4 lines, end your status by typing a period and 
                carraige return in the far left hand margin.
                

                The program will then ask:

              IS THE STATUS CORRECT ? FOR TICKET #  307438
              C.R. WILL WRITE IT TO THE DATABASE, ANYTHING ELSE, 
              WILL CAUSE YOU TO START OVER AGAIN :

                If any character is typed at this prompt, the status
                is discarded and the prompt to enter ticket status
                will appear again.
                                       
                A carriage return will save your status as shown.
                Then:



                                                                             




              ENTER TIME OR C.R. FOR 09:24 GMT :

                The 9:24 will be whatever the current Greenwich Mean
                Time (GMT) is. To change it, type in the change now
                in the format:  07:24
                To keep the time the same, type a carriage return.
                The next prompt will be:



              IS THIS STATUS ADMINISTRATIVE (A), OR TECHNICAL (T)?

                A technical status constitutes:
                                  
                * Description of the outage/problem.
                * Information contributing to resolution.
                  e.g., diagnostics, parts replaced, code change.

                An administrative status constitutes:

                * Information not directly contributing to resolution.
                  e.g., leaving a message for someone to status ticket,
                  informing a CS of status entered by STS.
                * Ticket maintenance.
                  e.g., transferring ticket from one refer group to
                  another, entering an incident # or DISCO, 
                  acknowledgement of acceptance of ticket.
                          

              
              PRODUCT = XCOM REFERRED TO = NSSC SEVERITY =           3
    DO YOU WISH TO CHANGE ANYTHING ABOVE (Y) OR RETURN TO THE MENU (C.R.)?:
        
                The Product ID, refer group and severity level currently
                in the header are indicated here.
        
                A carriage return indicates no change is needed to these
                fields and the user is returned to the main prompt.
                If a change is needed to any field in the ticket header
                type 'Y'.  The same choice list as the 'G' command will
                then appear.  See Appendix H or Section IV., D for more 
                information.








            #2  To put a ticket on monitor

                The ticket state of monitor is used to ensure the
                stability of network components following service
                restoration. Monitor should only be used in cases
                where component stability is not immediately evident.
                In any case, the maximum period of monitor is 24
                hours at which time the ticket is closed or reopened
                as appropriate. 

                Resolve time is automatically set up when a ticket 
                is placed on monitor.

                See Section X. for a complete discussion of monitor.



             #3 Close a ticket.

                When a problem is resolved and all investigation
                complete, the ticket is closed.
                Status choice #3 prompts the user through the
                sequence of closing a ticket covered in section XI.

                Note: A 'C' can also be used to close a ticket from 
                      the main prompt.


             #4 Reopening a ticket.

                1. Reopen a currently closed ticket or an open ticket
                   that has the resolve time set. This can only be done 
                   if the ticket resolve time reflects less than 24 
                   hours from the current time.

                2. Using this command will zero out the resolve time
                   on an open ticket.  It will then reset the elapsed
                   time to reflect the amount of hours from the time
                   the ticket was opened to the present and continue
                   to increase.  When the ticket is closed the elapsed
                   time will reflect only the total time the ticket 
                   was open without resolve time set.

                3. When issuing this command the user will be prompted 
                   to add status, time, and changes with the 'G'
                   command just as above with the #1 command.








             #5 Make no change.

                Returns the user to the main prompt.


             #6 Enter "Ticmark"

                A "Ticmark" is a comment about the service received
                from a Hardware maintenance group, a Software group,
                or a Vendor such as Telco.
                "Ticmarks" can also be entered using the 'V' command; 
                the difference being, with 'S' #6 you will also have 
                the ability to enter a status.
                See Section XIII for a complete explanation of
                    Ticmarks.


             #7 To document an escalation

                See Section VI for complete discussion of
                escalation.
                Escalations can be entered using the 'E' command.


             #8 To defer a ticket

                Any deferral time entered will be subtracted
                from the elapsed time when the ticket is closed.

                See Section VII for complete discussion of
                deferments.
                Deferment can also be entered using the 'D' command.


             #9 To place a ticket on 'track'

                Stops all data from being included in MTTR.
                Used by all Ops groups for the following:

                1. PM (Preventive Maintenance) tickets.
                2. Project (installations, upgrades) tickets.








                3. Documentation tickets.
                4. Non - BT Tymnet problems.

                Will prompt you to add status, time and changes
                with the 'G' command just as in option #1 above.



            #10 Will set the resolve at whatever time is chosen.

                The program prompts the technician for a status. 
                Enter a status as shown in #1 above. If no status is
                needed, type a period carriage return at the far 
                left hand margin. The program prompts for a time which 
                is then entered as the resolve time in the ticket.
                Any time entered (GMT) previous to the current
                time will be registered automatically with the  
                correct date for the past 24 hours.

                Example: If it is 02:00 GMT June 30th  and the resolve 
                         time needs to be set for 10:00GMT  the day before 
                         or June 29th, typing in 10:00  when prompted will 
                         set resolve time for June 29th.



            #11 De-Escalate a ticket.

                Used if a ticket has been escalated to Software
                Technical Support (STS) or National Technical Support
                (NTS) (in-house Technical support).  When a proposed
                or actual resolution is reached by one of these two 
                groups, the ticket is de-escalated and may or may not 
                be closed at that time. If the ticket is being closed, 
                the de-escalation will be required at that time.  If 
                the ticket is to remain open (for further investigation 
                by another group or implemention of the escalation
                resolution), use this option to de-escalate.
                After prompting the user for status and time,
                a code must be entered to indicate what type of
                resolution was arrived at by STS or NTS.
                The De-Escalation Codes are:

            A1 - Add Call Back-Adds a person's name, company, and phone 
                 number to the opening status of a ticket. Used by public 
                 network operations, because an outage/ticket may involve 
                 more than one  company.  Rarely used by private network
                 operations.
                 When closing a ticket with A1 added, system will not
                 close ticket until the technician has indicated that 
                 the callbacks have been completed.
             L - Look At A Ticket-Prints the ticket on the screen with the 
                 number of total statuses indicated and offers a choice of

                 particular Host, Node, or Circuit for a given network.
             W - Whats New For Today-Lists all tickets that were opened 
                 in the time between the 'End of Shift Reports'. 'End of 
                 Shift Report' is run by Network Control every night. 
             I - List Chart Of Nets-Creates a list of all networks with 
                 the number of tickets open, on monitor, and total at the 
                 current time.
             7 - List Un-Updated Tickets-Lists the tickets according to 
                 severity levels that are due for a status/update or 
                 escalation.

             X - Examine A Ticket-To see tickets currently open when one 
                 of the following is known: Host #, Node #, Circuit #, 
                 Customer name (first 3 letters), Ticket #.
                 Note: Is used mainly by NETOPS technicians when 
                 information is needed on a public network customer.
                 Example: X then C MOT will list the tickets open for
                 customer Motorola without going through all TYMNET 
                 tickets.  Note that if another customer name were
                 to begin with MOT, those tickets will be printed
                 also.
             1 - Tickets By Product-Lists all tickets open on a particular 
                 Product ID.
                 See Appendix B for a list of Product ID's


                                                                            




             4 - Tic By F.E. Region-Will print a list of the tickets which 
                 are referred (Attention Group) to a particular region. 
                 F.E stands for Field Engineering but this option also 
                 includes software regions and project tickets.
             ? - Extended Help List-Prints privileged commands.
             S - Update/Change Status-See Section VIII for complete 
                 information on statusing.
             G - Modify Attributes-See Section IV and Appendix I for 
                 complete information on changing ticket fields.
             D - Defer Ticket-See Section VII and Appendix E for complete 
                 information on deferring tickets.
            SW - Start Work-Used by support groups to indicate when and how

             F - Create A Disk File-Will create a file on system 26 
                 containing tickets categorized by Network, Support Group, 
                 or individual tickets.
             K - Know What Is Yours-Lists all tickets currently assigned to 
                 a group.
                 i.e., typing 'K' and '59' will list tickets that are 
                 currently referred to MDUK since their referred to
                 group number is 59. 
                 See Appendix A for network numbers.
             E - Escalate-See Section VI and Appendix D for complete 
                 information on escalating and severities.
             6 - Escalation Matrix-Does nothing.
             Q - Quit Program-Exit program
             5 - All Open Tickets-Lists every open ticket.
             2 - List Escalated Tickets-Lists all the tickets currently 
                 open that have been or are escalated.                          
             3 - Report Escalated Tickets-Creates a report on system 26 of 
                 the escalated tickets for a certain date.
             8 - Historical Escalated Tickets-Creates a file on system 26 
                 for closed escalated tickets during a designated repair 
                 cycle.
             9 - List Last Status Time-Indicates the time, date, and initials 
                 of the last status for the ticket you choose.

                    archive database into  the current one.  Do this to 
                    make a change to a ticket that has been closed for more
                    than 24 hours.
             REP  - Transfer To Report Program-Calls up the report program 
                    which is a separate program from 'PAPER'.
                    In report mode there are 22 different reports e.g.,
                    Shift reports, MTTR (Mean Time To Repair); and Database 
                    administration.
             VER  - Prints Version Of PAPER-Prints the current version of 
                    the program.
             MSG  - Program Changes-If the programmer has made a change to 
                    the program, and has documented it, the message would 
                    print here.
                    Most recently this feature has been revised somewhat
                    to print a message/update when user logs into PAPER
                    for the first 5 times after a new message is entered.
             REOPE- Reopens A Ticket-Moves a ticket's records out of the 
                    archive database so that it can be reopened.
             COM  - Transfer To "CO-Automatic running of the Shift Command 
                    used by Network Control and run nightly to move ticket 
                    records.  Option is the same as typing 'R COM' at the 
                    exec prompt of PDP10.
                    Will prompt for the name of a command file.
             Z    - Resets Ticket #-If the system has mistakenly opened two 
                    tickets with the same ticket number, using the Z will 
                    reset the ticket number to a different number thus 
                    avoiding duplication.
             V    - Enter Q.A. Points-See Section XIII. Adds a comment about 
                    a support group.



 
          C. Addtional Commands not printed in the Ticket System's Help Lists
            








            TT    - Transfers a ticket from one Refer (Attention) Group
                    to another.  See also - G command Section IV. D. and 
                    Appendix H.

            AR    - Enters the time a field engineer arrived on site.

            AC    - Enables the technician to put a comment into the
                    system that will display every time a ticket is 
                    opened on the particular node/host/circuit.
                    This  entry is  limited to  one line of text 80
                    characters in length.

            DP    - Enables the user to review the information contained
                    in the database for a particular node, host or circuit.

            AP    - Add information to the database for a particular
                    node, host, circuit.

            A1    - Adds a callback name and number for a ticket.
                    If there is more than one customer affected by the
                    outage and the various customers must be called when
                    service is restored, this command puts the information
                    into the database and prints the information when
                    looking at a ticket header or closing a ticket.

            C1    - Indicates that a call back has been made to a 
                    particular customer on the callback list.

            D1    - Indicates some information about a callback number
                    such as who entered callback and when.

            






                                                                            




         X. MONITOR
    
            A. The Use of Monitor

   
               1. The monitor state can be used for up to 24 hours to
                  ensure stability of a network component prior to closing
                  a ticket.  At the end of the designated monitor period
                  (24 hour maxium), the trouble must be closed or reopened.
                  The monitor state should be used very sparingly.  In
                  most cases, when an outage has been resolved and verified,
                  the ticket should be closed.  An example of the use of
                  monitor would be to verify the "fix" (stability), of a
                  chronic problem such as intermittent errors on a circuit. 

            B. Placing a ticket on monitor:

               Type an 'S' from the menu choices use # 2. Type in an 
               informational status if desired. The time entered 
               automatically sets the resolve or time up.




                                                                            







         XI. CLOSING A TICKET
           
             A. WHEN TO CLOSE A TICKET
        
                1. There are 4 types of tickets to close:

                   a. Tickets reported by someone other than a Network
                      Technician.

                      Reported tickets have been opened at the request of
                      a customer, CS or Project manager. Such tickets should 
                      be closed with the person reporting the problem by 
                      calling and confirming the problem is resolved.  This 
                      person's name should always appear in the ticket header
                      under RPTD BY. The phone number to reach this person 
                      should appear in the ticket header under RPHONE (See 
                      also Section II)

                   b. Tickets reported by ontyme from a CS or
                      escalation group for escalation purposes to STS.

                      This type of ticket will generally be brought
                      to the operation groups attention by changing the
                      REFERRED GROUP in the ticket header.  The
                      ticket will then show up when a technician 
                      does a 'K' command (See also Section IX).
                      If at that time the CS, etc has statused the
                      ticket that a resolution has been reached and
                      the ticket can be closed, you can do so without
                      a phone call.

                   c. Tickets opened by an Operations Group. 
                     
                      This will occur when an anomaly is recorded 
                      through the various monitoring processes.
                      In these types of tickets, when the 
                      technician is satisfied that the problem is 
                      resolved, the ticket can be closed with
                      no phone call. *Exception: When there
                      have been call backs added to the ticket.
                      These people need to be called first.



                                                                            




                   d. A ticket opened on a problem which is now
                      resolved, but customer has requested a 
                      monitoring period.         


                2. In summary: close a ticket when the problem is 
                   confirmed resolved. Close a ticket with the 
                   concurrence of the reporting person or after an 
                   agreed monitoring period.


             B. COMMANDS TO CLOSE A TICKET
        
                1. 'S' and then option #3.

                2. 'C'

                3. Either of the above will obtain the same result.
                   The following will appear:




                    ******** NO Q.A. ENTRIES MADE ********

       CTT RR COMMENTS..................................................




                4. Above is the prompt to enter a ticmark or Q.A.
                   This is a comment about the service rendered in
                   resolving this ticket.
                   (See Section XIII for complete explanation of
                   Ticmarks/Q.A. and Appendix J)


                5. After entering the ticmark or if entering no
                   ticmark, enter a -1 in the left hand margin and
                   then carriage return to close the ticket.




             C. CLOSING THE TICKET.


                1. The technician will then be prompted to add a status.
                   The system will prompt - 'WHY IS THIS TICKET BEING 
                   CLOSED?'

                2. Enter the resolution--tests/diagnosis performed
                   to confirm resolution, who confirmed the problem 
                   is resolved (i.e., customer), who has been informed. 
                                     
                3. Enter 4 lines of status or a period and carriage 
                   return in the left hand margin to end the closing
                   status.

                4. The technician is to review the closing status and 
                   change it if appropriate.

                5. The next prompt is to enter the 'CLOSE OUT CODE'
                   The choices are:








         ENTER THE CLOSE OUT CODE...
            1 = NTF/D&R
            2 = HARDWARE
            3 = SOFTWARE
            4 = UNKNOWN
            5 = CUSTOMER INDUCED
            6 = TELCO INDUCED
            7 = O.E.M. (MODEMS, ETC)
            8 = POWER OUTAGE AT THE SITE
            9 = PERIFERALS
           10 = DEAD ENDED NODE
           11 = PROJECT
           12 = ASYNC PROJECT
        ENTER CHOICE...?:


                6. For an explanation of Close Out Codes and what
                   they are used for See Appendix G.

                7. Numbers 1 and 4 should be used limitedly since
                   a technician's job is to identify the cause and
                   resolution of network problems to prevent their
                   reoccurence.    


             D. DE-ESCALATION

                1. If the ticket has been escalated to STS, NTS, etc.
                   the system will prompt the technician after entering 
                   Close Out Code.  
                   (See Section VIII,C,11 for explanation of 
                   De-escalation choices.)

             E. CHANGE HEADER FIELDS 

                1. The last prompt, is the same as when statusing a 
                   ticket, i.e., to change any field using the 'G' 
                   Command.
                   (See Section IV,D and Appendix I)







                2. The comment field should be changed at this time.
                   If, for any reason, the direction of the ticket
                   was changed from the original opening comment,
                   change it now.

                   The comment field prints every time the archive 
                   database is accessed and must be kept accurate.

                3. The correct attention/refer group should be verified
                   since the ticket may have been transferred to the
                   control group for closing.  

                   The refer group should accurately reflect the
                   ticket progress.

              
             F. CALL BACKS

                1. Ensure all callbacks have been satisfied.
                   Primarily for async group tickets for Public 
                   Network.



                                                                            





      XII. REOPENING TICKETS

              A. The purpose of the ticket system is to record
                 problem occurrences.  Every time a problem occurs 
                 there should be a ticket to track it. Therefore, some
                 controls have been built into the PAPER program:

                 1. If the ticket has been closed for more than 24
                    hours the program will not allow it to be reopened.

                 2. If the 'resolve time' has been set up more
                    than 24 hours, a ticket cannot be reopened.  

                    (a) In this case, a technician would try to zero out
                        the resolve time if the problem reoccurred before
                        the ticket was closed.

                        Example:  A node crashes;  a dispatch takes place.
                                  A hardware fix is accomplished and service
                                  is restored. Ticket is statused.
                                  'Time up' is set (Resolve Time). While 
                                  verifying that everthing is O.K., the  
                                  node crashes again.  The ticket would then 
                                  be reopened to set the resolve time to zero
                                  since the service is gone. 
                                  This can be accomplished as long as the
                                  ticket had not remained open for 24 hours
                                  after the time up was set.

              B. Option #4 of the 'S' command will reopen a ticket
                 after it has been closed.

                        










     XIII TICMARK
                                     

          A. TICMARKS / Q.A. (QUALITY ASSURANCE)

              When closing a ticket the technician will automatically 
              be prompted to add a "ticmark" if desired.  Otherwise 
              one can be added later.

              The commands are:

              1. 'V', to enter a "ticmark".
            
              2. 'S' and then option #3, to enter a "ticmark" and a ticket
                 status.
      
              3. 'C', to enter a "ticmark" and close the ticket.

              4. Any of the above will bring the technician to the same 
                 point.

                 The following will appear:

                    ******** NO Q.A. ENTRIES MADE ********

              If a Q.A. entry had been made it would show up here

            1. A ticmark can be entered at any time during the course
               of a ticket.  The above printout is to remind the
               technician when closing a ticket if there were any
               reasons to make a comment.

            2. A ticmark can be positive or negative.


            3. Enter "ticmark" in the following format:

               C = H,S,V  (Hardware, Software, Vendor)
                          (Vendor = Telco, Paradyne,etc)
              TT = Qualilty Assurance Code.  See Appendix J.
              RR = Refer Group # that you are commenting on.
                   (See Appendix for 2 digit # corresponding
                    to the appropriate group)

            4. If a field engineer from Minneapolis arrived an
               hour late on site for dispatch the technician would
               type:

         The following guidelines/rules govern deferment of a ticket.
        
             1. No customer site access. i.e., site closed from 6:00 pm
                to 6:00 am - ticket would be deferred 12 hours.
        
             2. Customer requested delay of repair - ticket would
                be deferred for the requested period of time.
        
             3. An outage occurs outside of the customer's principle
                period of maintenance and the customer does not want
                a service call made.

                i.e., customer has a maintenance contract effective from
                8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday; they ex-
                perience an outage at 6:00 pm Friday night and want
                the hardware dispatch at 8:00 am Monday; the ticket
                would be deferred 62 hours.

             4. Tickets are not deferred while awaiting parts from a 
                Field Service Vendor.


                * Note - It is not necessary to defer a ticket if the
                         resolve time is set up.
