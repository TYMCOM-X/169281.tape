^EACH <MDC COMPUTER SYSTEM HAS A ^LOCAL ^USER ^DIRECTORY
CALLED THE <LUD.
^THIS USER DIRECTORY IS USED BY THE MONITOR TO KEEP TRACK OF USERS AND
USER PARAMETERS ON THAT SYSTEM.
^TWO OF THESE PARAMETERS ARE THE ^GLOBAL ^ACCOUNT ^NUMBER (<GAN) AND
THE ^UNIVERSAL ^USER ^NUMBER (<UUN).
^THE <GAN ORGANIZES USERS WITHIN THE SAME ACCOUNT INTO A GROUPING FOR
FILE SECURITY AND CERTAIN BILLING PURPOSES.
^THE <UUN PROVIDES EACH USER WITH A NUMBER WHICH IS UNIQUE TO THAT USER
AND WILL REFERENCE THAT USER REGARDLESS OF ANY SIMILAR USERNAME ON
ANY OTHER <MDC COMPUTERS.
^IT WILL REMAIN WITH THAT USER EVEN IF HE/SHE REQUESTS THAT THE USERNAME
BE CHANGED.
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
^TOGETHER, THESE TWO PARAMETERS COMPRISE THE ^PROJECT ^PROGRAMMER
^NUMBER (<PPN).
^THE <PPN ORIGINATED WITH THE STANDARD <DEC FILE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE WHERE
IT TOOK THE PLACE OF USERNAMES.
^FOR THIS REASON, SEVERAL OF THE <DEC SUBSYSTEMS WHICH ARE STILL
IN USE BY <MDC ^OPERATIONS REQUIRE THAT A <PPN BE USED RATHER THAN
A USERNAME. 
^THE TWO MOST COMMONLY USED SUBSYSTEMS REQUIRING <PPN'S ARE <PIP 
(^PERIPHERAL ^INTERCHANGE ^PROGRAM) AND <FAILSA.
