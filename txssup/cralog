   Appears to have done about three impossible things at once: was
   processing an interrupt at PI 1 when it got an illegal instruction
   (opcode 0) in the null job (user mode), then took an exec mode
   UUO trap and page-faulted trying to store the halt status in
   job 0's second context page (it only has one).  Right. (Darren)

   Exec page fault at SIMIO:INBLT2+2 for exec page 341 (nicely mapped
   to physical page 1415) while running DSKCLN.  OPER mail says
   memory problems.  We believe it. (Darren)

   No OPER mail indicating reason for dump. (Darren)

   Took wild branch to location 3 while doing SIMIO output. (Darren)

6 JAN 0838 C29-P034/J27-1 $H #1286-KL CRA007, StopPC/ERRCON:ILLINS+2
   Crashed while running DSKCLN at one of the two instructions
   following INBLT2.  Crash is identical to CRA003, except it claims
   to have gotten an illegal instruction rather than an exec page
   fault. Chalk it up to same cause. (Darren)

   Received msg type 40 (octal) for port 172 (octal) from base -
   highest network port number is 164 (octal). (DARREN)

   DRB in RH(SYSDRB) not found on chain based in LH(SYSDRB) in GETCOR
   because clever systems hacker patched it out of the chain after
   using TSTSUP on the user's UFD. (DARREN)

31 MAR 2008 (C29) $U CRA003, Bad dump SysNam[0 No data to analyze;
   usually due to clearing memory before dump.
   OPER mail says base init, no error lights, so can't tell. (DARREN)

28 JUL 1425 C29-P034/K-6 $N #1286-KL CRA001, StopPC/SCNSER:BADPRT+2
   Base sent us message type 40 (response to terminal characteristics
   probe) for port 303, which is out of range.  User GLEE running
   NAD on job 6 reportedly caused problem by building circuit to HORUS:290
   which is an X.75 gateway.  The problem appears to be repeatable.  (WRS)
