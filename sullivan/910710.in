Thanks for the quick replies.

I have a few more questions.

Neil metioned that he thought the input data was corrupted because it
may have used an incorrectly formatted file as input to DAILY.

If this is true, did Neil isolate this to any specific day or days?

Also, if the input data was corrupted, then I still can't see why
only three files would be bad?  The DAILY processes all of the ".ALL"
files from the same input.

Your comments would be appreciated.  Again, simply rerunning would
produce the same output.  I think we need to investigate any possible
corrupted input files.

Any help would be appreciated.

thanks,

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ken,

Further to our conversations on July 8th, the followings are some
of the concerns or issues that we have for PCI:

1. PCI's representative
   --------------------

   With  Bob  Kelly leaving PCI, we would like to  find  out  who
   will be the replacement for Bob? As mentioned by you, Bob will
   continue  be working as a consultant for PCI. Should we  still
   deal direct with him in terms of any PCI projects or  somebody
   from PCI will be designated as our main contact?

2. Work relationship
   -----------------

   Since my takeover as a project manager for the PCI account  in
   April,  I haven't had any luck to get Bob Kelley to  agree  on
   setting up a conference meeting with us on a regular basis  to
   monitor/discuss  their  problems and  project  activities  for
   PCI.  This  in fact has caused us a lot  of  frustrations  and
   time  to try to beat them up for status and  directions.  With
   periodic reviews and proper communications, it sure will  help
   us to serve them effectively and efficiently.

   I am hoping this can be improved once a dedicated PCI's rep is
   assigned.

Please  bring this up to the attention of PCI's CEO when you  are
meeting with him on July 10th and 11th.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,
