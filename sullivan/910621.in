Parish Closes Quotron Account


Southwest District Account Manager, David Parish,
has closed a TYMNET Shared Network solution for
Quotron Systems Inc. to deliver information services
to the 500 offices of its brokerage firm, Raymond James.
The Quotron contract will provide BT North America
with revenues of $100K per month over the next two years.

The Company and the Solution

Quotron provides real-time stock quotes and financial
market information to brokerage firms, banks, S&L's, and
financial planners.  The company's strategic direction
is to streamline operations and focus on their core business.
Quotron was looking for a partner who could provide
complete network management.  Dave says, "They
were definitely looking for a telecommunications
partner who could handle every aspect of the
Raymond James solution."

The BT North America solution supports the financial
applications and communications services for Raymond
James.  The brokerage firm has three requirements:

%	Small offices will use an async dial-up solution.
%	Medium-size offices requiring dedicated access
will utilize Private Access Ports.
%	Large offices requiring multiple dedicated access
ports will benefit from a TYMNET XLINK solution.  Quotron
will purchase four or eight port pads.

The initial host configuration consists of two 56K bps
connections and X.25 interfaces.  BT North America will
provide Telematics Customer Premise Equipment to fulfill
the requirement for multiple 9.6K bps connections.

The Competition

Dave closed the account over a five-month sales cycle.
His main competitors were MCI and SprintNet. The primary
advantages provided by these companies were cost-related.
Both offered significantly less expensive solutions, in a
simple pricing scheme. This made forecasting much
easier for Quotron and, in conjunction with ubiquitous '800'
coverage, presented a significant obstacle to a BT North
America win.  Yet, neither of these competitors could
offer a single-vendor solution.

BT North America's Triumph

Dave says, "BT North America triumphed because we
could provide Quotron with a turnkey solution and
comprehensive support to enable the company to pursue
its strategic plans.  Quotron felt comfortable that we
had the capability and desire to provide a single-vendor
solution for them. Fully knowing and understanding their
business provided another key advantage."

Sales Manager Mary Huson considers the win a strategic
step towards positioning BT North America within Quotron.
"Over a year ago, SprintNet won a large network bid and BT
North America's opportunities were limited.  Because of
David's efforts within Quotron this last year, BT North
America is now considered a preferred vendor."

Dave also emphasizes the importance of teamwork in
closing the sale. "Although Quotron was initially skeptical,
we won their confidence because we made them comfortable
with the choice of BT North America as their long-term
strategic ally."  The sales team relied heavily on the
talents of Deb Mielke's Western Region Systems Engineering
and Proposal Writing Group to close the business.  Deb
provided technical expertise; Systems Engineer, Bob
Hammond, worked closely with Quotron's technical personnel
and was virtually on-call during the final phases of
negotiation; and Technical Writer, Janice Little, followed
up with a powerful proposal.  Communications Specialist,
Anthony Luu, also managed the successful in-house testing
which contributed greatly to the sale.  Scott Zarriello, the
Account Manager for Citicorp, Quotron's parent corporation,
helped illuminate the relationship between BT North America
and Citicorp.

Additional Opportunities

Besides the revenue which this contract provides, BT North
America will benefit because Quotron is one of only two major
players in the stock quote business. This contract gives BT North
America a strong foothold to pursue more business from Quotron,
plus the business of the other major player and the hundreds of
client firms it represents.

Quotron has also indicated that if the present project proceeds
satisfactorily, they may use the TYMNET Shared Network to
provide connectivity to more of their brokerage customers.
Dave says, "Because we have been working closely with the
Quotron sales and marketing division, as well as network
services and technical operations, there are several BT North
America proponents within the Quotron organization who are
very excited about this solution, and who hope to use it as a
strategic marketing tool with which to pursue additional stock
quote customers."

Congratulations to all who contributed their efforts to
this important account!

I would be happy to meet with you and bring you up to date on what
I know about the history and status.  Much of the information you
are asking for should be in the files that are with the settlements

Kathy,

Further to our conversation of yesterday, before I accept taking over the
settlement for SNET I need to meet with you and get full background
particulars on the account.  Such as what is the history on the account,
when did we last settle with SNET, is their an outstanding unrecorded
liability on the account, if so how much and dating back to when?  Are their
any other accounts of this nature?  Cami Ashton tells me SNET is an Enhanced
Routing Service customer and that their are others (Ninex & General Video
Text).  Are you expecting to hand them off to me as well?  What is the
customers attitude toward us?  Are we settled to date?  How long have you
been responsible for these settlements and when were your last customer
contacts.

If and when we agree to the transfer of responsibility, I will need up to
date customer files, any records of problems, claims and their current
status.

SCHLUMBERGER SINET

I  have  received  your fax on the subject of the address translations
desired by Schlumberger. The only facility that I know of that  Tymnet
Technology could provide is the DTE that is a user name.

We can cause a DTE range such as 3106912340000 to 3106912349999 to  be
targeted  to  a  single  interface. In fact each address that is to be
used would be entered into the Supervisior  as  a  username  with  the
target  that  was  desired.  The  names could have multiple targets if
desired.

The  number  9  in  position  5 causes this address to be treated as a
username and the true address looked up in the sup tables.

The  address  passed to the host network will be the DTE used on entry
into the network not the host address from the sup tables.

Calls  from  their network would not have the 310691234xxxx address as
the calling DTE.


In  TYMVISA  we use a MENU SERVER to do a crude mapping. A username or
CALLED DTE addresses a MENU SERVER and a second call is produced  that
goes  to  a  canned X.121 address in some other network (normally in a
non-TYMNET country). This allows the  host  service  provider  in  the
other  country  to  pay  the  bill  and  provide  toll  access to
customers on Tymnet.

This may be able to be modified to serve the function you desire.
