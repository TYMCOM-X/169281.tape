Subject: "D54's crash had the same buffered"... 

D54's crash had the same buffered message as D34 - INFO stopcode BASE just
before the IME stopcode.

Let me see if I've got this straigt:
18:11 D35 dies with a KL10 CLOCK STOP - FM PARITY.
18:11 D34 dies with IME stopcode (and has a buffered BASE stopcode).
18:18 D25 dies with APRFAT stopcode from NXM=Nonexistent Memory.
18:22 D54 dies with IME stopcode (and has a buffered BASE stopcode).
18:30 D65 dies with NONAME stopcode in SCNSER (it ran out of TTY buffers).
--:-- D56 did not die, mail from D56 is duplicate of mail from D65.

Was there a sudden burst of ionizing radiation in Dallas?  A power fluctuation?
D35 and D25 are hardware failures in the PDP-10, D34 and D54 look like a
failure in the base.  Very strange.
