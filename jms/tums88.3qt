Yes, it is a very good idea as to not to refer to X32 as "SPARE"
system.  SPARE has the connotation of being dispensable which
I don't like our system being refered to.

By the way, Joe tested the 41 day crash on the base successfully.

   User name is (EBUS), file name NWxxxx.BND.

   Fremont D.C. has been running with the "NEW BASE CODE" successfully and
   without any problems.  Again, one of the important fixes in the new base
   code is: Prevention of host/base crashes when system has been up more
   than 41 days.

   If you have any problems with the new base code, please send mail indicating
   on what system it was not successful.


o  I am planning to be in Dallas Aug 2-4 to teach a seminar to "Operations"
   and "MDFSCO" and whoever else is interested in attending.

   The basic thrust of the seminar will be to go over the new and updated
   monitor functionality and some system utilities.

See you all soon.

The odd output must be a bug in the routine that prints the date.  It was not
intended that way.  The system date error is caused when it comes across a file
that is MAX+1 days old.  This means that either the date is screwed up and it
may really not be that old (in which case we shouldn't return all the mail to
sender) or the mailer has not run for more than a day.  Most likely the former.

Subject: TUMS/ONTYME gateway on host 65 (RIP) and other matters 

I need your help.  

Up until last week, most of our developers used host 65 for code development
and used TUMS.  They all had their ONTYME mail read by TUMS.

As late as yesterday, it appears that ONTYME mail is still being read by
TUMS and attempting to deliver it to usernames on 65--and, of course, being
returned.  I obviously was in error in that I thought the file for 65 TUMS
users who wished their ontymes read existed on 65 and would disappear with
it.  Guess not.

Anyway, we need to turn off this feature, and I need to know what we must
do to make sure this is accomplished.  

Also, and I am not sure who else to ask, and this is why you are getting the
question, would you have any idea what is file "LLIBA2"?  I attempted to
load my init file on this (25) host and got the error message that it was unable
to find that file.  If you could direct me as to whom to ask...

Thank you very much.  I hope our oversight regarding TUMS has not caused
you any headaches.

	The "NEW EBUS BASE CODE" which has had a couple of fixes, has been
running in Fremont D. C. successfully.  Dallas D. C. will start running it
this week.  They are loading the bases from user name (EBUS) on systems
25, 54 and 33.  The base codes are named NWxxxx.BND.

	Process of releasing the Base Code officially is in progress with
the NTD people.

Subject: Hodgepodge from August Sci-Am 

Have you seen "Computer Recretions" in the August Scientific American?
For simulations with N=63, all states would show up on an extra-halfbrite
screen.  Is it difficult to get the Amiga's blitter to do integer division?
I'd love to see an Amiga version of HODGEPODGE running at blitter speeds.

Joe;

I have no knowledge of what you todl FSC to do or not to do.  I
do not know what operator you talked too.  What operator did you talk
too?

I was called and asked if I wanted to do anything on the system.  I told them
No.  I said if FSC had return the sytem to them to bring it up.

One would think they would do what was asked of them.

I talk to Brad Dong.  He claims that sense-switch 4 was set but the monitor
came up anyway.  You were there when he said it, but I did not register its
significance.  Looking back, I should have made sure F74 did a full DSKCLN
the moment I walked in, but my brain was not fully awake yet.

I will be in to look at the hardcopy.   /Joe

Tracking down MM interlock problems on an SMP system is very nasty.
I looked at it, and found nothing obvious.  My guess is that it will take
over a week of solid looking to find the problem, which will undoubtedly
require a change to the software to fix.  As I understand it, this would
exceed the amount of software support we have promised (if any) to this
customer.  I'll leave it at that.     /Joe

WRS fixed (MAIL)ONTYME.DAT sometime last night so that ONTYME mail would not
got to D65.   I don't know what refers to LLIBA2, but do know of a better
program than INIT.SAV and INIT.SAI.  All of us in the development group
have our INIT program set to (SYS)LOGON.  That program reads a file called
SWITCH.INI, which is easier to change than editting and recompiling a SAIL
program.  I recommend everyone use LOGON instead of INIT.SAV.  For further
info, type "HELP LOGON".                 /Joe

The latest version of TUMS (on 39, but not sure where else) should report this
problem and then promptly fix it (using a heuristic).  Its rather graceful.
I thought I distributed it, but maybe not if he is still seeing this problem.

Remember he will still get the message (once) but the symptoms of having TUMS
think the messages begin and end in the wrong places should not appear.  -Bill

Subject: F30's problem was an off-by-one bug in ONCE. 

EVASIZ has the highest unused address.  When EVACLR rounded it up to a page
boundary, it did so using a method that failed if EVASIZ just happened to
be on a page boundary.  In particular, the monitor asked for memory up to
and including address 744777, which made EVASIZ be 745000 (the first unused
location).  The old code using IORI T4,777 and ADDI T4,1 would round that
up to address 746000, instead of leaving it at 745000.  (A kludge to get
around the problem was to bump PATSIZ up by a couple of pages - incrementing
it by any number that was not a multiple of 145 did the trick.)  The file
EVACLR.PAT has been created, and added to DMON.PAT as patch #8.   /Joe

Subject: Dispatch wants us to close incidents. 

A typical call to Central Dispatch goes like this:
  o  The Data Center has a problem that may be software, they call Dispatch.
  o  Dispatch opens an incident number, pages us.
  o  We call Dispatch, get system number, this marks incident as answered.
  o  We look at problem, fix it, or tell them it's a hardware problem.
  o  Third Party Maintenance fixes the hardware, opens a new incident number,
     gives Dispatch a code number for what was replaced, closes the incident.
  o  Third Party happens to notice an open incidence number pertaining to
     the system they just fixed, and closes it for us.

We have been unaware of that last step.  If it is not done, a timer
automatically escalates it.  If the original incident was logged on Friday
evening, it may escalate to the Regional Manager by Monday morning.

To avoid this in the future, we need to be sure to get the incident number
when answering the page from Dispatch, and to call Dispatch back when we
are done working on the call.  The incident number needs to included in the
mail sent to MONITOR and included in (M33:33)HOTLIN.LOG.

The July 11, 1988 issue of Federal Computer Week has an editorial
written by Fred Reed ("Ada: A View From the Field", page 19) which
supposedly presents both the pros and cons of Ada. The following
quotes are representative:

"What follows is one man's opinion, but it is an informed opinion --
he programs in Ada as well as C and other -- so I thought it was worth
passing along. We'll call him Bob because, Ada being a fairly sacred
cow, he didn't want to be named."

"... Ada has been called everybody's favorite 17 programming
languages." 

"Fewer programming errors. Among other features, Bob explained, Ada
has what are called strong typing and range checking. Strong typing
means that the programmer is forced to tell the computer the nature of
each piece of information he uses. This allows the machine to be sure
incompatible kinds of information are not mixed."

"Ada, said Bob, is well suited to being understood and maintained by
many programmers who will work on a large program over its lifetime.
This is why it saves money, he said."

"However, he noted, these strength also result in weaknesses. For
example, the programmer has to write extra code to do the strong
typing and range checking, and this, among other things, makes Ada
code slow to write."

"Further, because the program constantly has to check ranges and data
types as it runs, Ada produces much slower programs than some other
languages.

"An Ada program typically runs a tenth as fast as the same program in
C," said Bob. "I think we are seeing the bureaucratic attitude at its
ultimate. Ada is a prudent approa

ch to software. It is defintely
suboptimal in performance -- slow, bulky, verbose and slow to write.
But it is reliable and easy to work with after it is written. It is
safe. These are qualities prized by bureaucrats. DoD chose reliability
over performance."

Subject: "I gave explicit instructions on"... 

I gave explicit instructions on what to do on system 74 that were not followed.
I asked that FSC work on BPA12 until it could be made on-line, and that the
operator bring the system to the FILES dialog so that the monitor would
verify that all of DSKB was present and not come up to users.

I regret not having demanded that F74 be halted when I was informed that it
went into auto-restart anyway.  At least one SAT page on BPA12 was wrong, and
since a full DSKCLN was not run, it allowed new files to be written on top
of old files.

The list of damaged files is so long that it overflowed the CTYLOG buffer.
It is important that the hardcopy from F74 be saved for analysis.  Did
DSKCLN report all errors on one unit (DSKB6:)?

     Ogura-san, I spoke with Rick Daniels this morning.
 
     As you probably already know, the problem with Magnum was caused by a
     Disk hardware problem (again) with host F74.
 
     The problem caused bad Magnum (and other) files, which resulted in
     your users receiving the FATAL MAGNUM ERRORS.
 
     Rick said all BAD files had been restored by this morning except for
     a few.  He said he would call me if any of the files could not be
     restored; I've received no phone call, therefore assume all files
     should now be okay.
 
     If you should continue to have problems, please contact us immediate-
     ly.  Also, if you require additional detail on the hardware problems,
     please inquire via Ontyme to Rick, with copies to me.
 
     Best regards. Ken

Makoto;

Yesterday, before I left, I also GFD'd to MVX and had no problem 
accessing MAGNUM.  The only other suggestion I have is to check
if files are declared correctly and proper status is set before
running program.

Thanks Rick

     Ogura-san, I've been busy all day and did not follow up on your prob-

     he had departed for the day.
 
     I tried GFD'ng to MVX and had no problem as of 1722 PDT.  If you
     should find you continue to have problems with Magnum, please Call or
     Ontyme Mike Bellopatrick (Shift Supervisor at the Fremont Center).
 
     Best regards. Ken

MIKE,
     
I HEARD YOUR NAME FROM KEN AS SHIFT SUPERVISOR OF FREMONT CENTER.
SO I SEND THIS ONTYME TO YOU. 
     
AS YOU KNOW MAGNUM ON F74 HAD A PROBLEM AT THE LAST WEEKEND. FROM THAT TIME,    
I HAVE A PROBLEM ABOUT (MVX:74)MAGNUM ACCESS.
     
AS KEN MENTIONED, HE TRIED GFD, CHECK MVX ACCOUNT, AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG.
HOWEVER, THIS MORNING, AT MY CHECKING, THE PROBLEM STILL APPEARED.    
I ATTACHED THE LOG OF MY TRIAL, SO PLEASE CHECK AND ADVISE ME.   
     
BEST REGARDS,  
MAKOTO    
P.S. IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE KEN'S USERNAME AND MY USERNAME OGURA CAUSING  
     DIFFERENT RESPONSE FROM THE MAGNUM SYSTEM ?

MAKOTO,
 
AS KEN WAS ABLE TO GFD TO "MVX" AND RUN MAGNUM, SO WAS I THROUGH "MICHAELB".
WE HAVE RUN SEVERAL PROGRAMS THIS EVENING USING MAGNUM, SUCH AS: ACCOUNTING,
STORES AND RESTORES.  ALL WITH NO PROBLEM.
 
MY ONLY SUGGESTION AT THIS TIME, IS TO COMPARE A DIRECTORY OF YOUR MAGNUM
FILES ON SYSTEM 74, PRIOR TO THE PROBLEMS, AGAINST YOUR CURRENT DIRECTORY.
IT MAY BE THAT ONE OF YOUR FILES IS MISSING OR BAD.
 
WE HAVE RUN THE "FNDBAD" PROGRAM TO LOCATE ANY BAD FILES AND AT THIS TIME
THERE ARE NONE.  BOTH "OGURA" AND "MVX" HAVE PLEANTY OF DISK SPACE.  AGAIN,
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF AT THIS TIME, IS ONE OF YOUR DIRECTORIES MISSING
A MAGNUM FILE.
 
PERHAPS RICK DANIELS CAN BE OF MORE ASSISTANCE.
 
REGARDS,
 
MIKE

Subject: SYSDAT, SYSSHO 

A newer version of SYSDAT and SYSSHO have been propagated to (CARL) on
all KL-10s in TYMNET.  Didn't do B39 or the 2020's except :17.

SYSDAT corrects a bug which overwrote the high-order 5 bits of the 12-bit
apr serial number with ones in the data.

SYSSHO now displays a new field after the memory usage "m%%" which is the
percentage of user memory required to meet the need of memory usage.  It
contains a slight hack, assuming the size of the running monitor is the size
to deduct from the amount of physical memory available for each sample, to
determine user available memory.



Note:  This change is in response to monitoring D56 when they get to adding
more memory.  For Sept.. the approx. highest usage was 350%, with the normal
usage above 150%, only a few periods that fell below 100%.

Subject: (PJ)JOB001.HGH has been updated. 

The version running everywhere was dated Aug-79.  It used <JRST .-1> to
keep polling for incoming characters.  There was a version in SSPAMSYM
dated Aug-82, but it had 3 problems.
1. It was loaded with a version of PAM.MAC that had the debugswitch set.
   This made it incompatible with the existing PAM.LOW, and caused I/O
   to unassigned channel due to mismatch.
2. The ACs weren't defined consistently.
3. The routine to do waiting did not have 2 <SOS (P)> instructions to
   retry the AUXCAL that read in characters.

The new version is running everywhere - it hibernates while waiting for input.

Joe,
  User TUMS has a strange shell (/usr/local/lib/smtp) which is set-uid
and read-protected, so I can't even tell if it a script or a short
program.  I can't even copy it blindly...
  We need to find out what this is, if we can make it work on SunOS, etc.

Subject: Re: Can TUMS talk to the Suns directly? 

I think Steve did something special on tymix to allow SMTP via Tymnet.  I'm not
sure what it was, but it was very simple.  I will try to research it.  At any
rate, tymix is sort of the designated clearing house for all Unix mail so I
think it would be the best solution to add their hosts to our /etc/hosts file.
This will cause them to eventually get added to router.net in a semi-automated
way.  Also of note is that we will be running a domain name server soon so it
should ease the name registration problem.  Almost certainly within the next 90
days as it is semi-necessary for our connection to MILNET.  At this time, tymix
will become the ARPAnet gateway to replace Office-1.  Julie Stier is the person
who is supposed to add hosts to /etc/hosts
STIER, JULIE                  x6311  B5-305  (B51)  CC#4040 NTD
so you might give her a call whenever you add a host off of antares until the
name server is all working.  -Bill

Subject: TUMS and antares 

  Adding hosts not on the local (to tymix) ether to the host list (wherever
is is kept) and to /etc/hosts doesn't buy us anything until we get a gateway
or router or bridge.  A domain name server on tymix would help as long as we
get our domain names standardized on hosts (I think all the unix machines
are claiming to be host.Tymnet.com, with some still claiming host.sun.com).
I guess we need to get another level of domains going?
  The problem (as I see it) is that is is hard to make tymix know about
machines that are hanging off of a neighbor.  For example, I have a work-
station, alchemy, off of antares.  How do I make tymix know about this,
or do I even want to make it know?  How do I generalize this to support
workstations on documentation's servers (which are sort-of uucp neighbors
of antares)?  To complicate things, tymix can't currently deal with an
address like krumvp%alchemy@antares (it loops between tymix and 39).
  The standard solution is to say use bang-path notation and fix tymix
to correctly handle user%subhost@host, but I'm not sure that all the
potential users can deal with this...  Even a domain name server may
not entirely solve this aspect of it.

Subject: Re: TUMS and antares 

The loop is because the host is not known to tymix.  Tymix is configured to send
any unrecognized host to TUMS.  On the other hand, if TUMS known its a unix host
it will send it back to tymix.  Sigh.  If there is no way for tymix to deliver
to antares-connected hosts, then you are right that TUMS should not be sending
it to tymix in the first place and tymix would be correct in sending it back.
This is all too brain damaged to talk about without a whiteboard - why not come
by and we can draw on my board.

We are also going to be arpanet connected in 2-6 weeks so our domain name will
become official (i.e. registered with arpa net) and will be:
	something.Tymnet.MDC.COM
The something is for us to decide, but almost certainly will be the host name.
The name server will resolve this to a host address taking care of gateways
such as TUMS or UUCP automatically.  This will no doubt take a while to get the
bugs out of, but in the long run will be very nice, I expect.

This also means that you'll have to renumber all your hosts to have official
host numbers or we won't be able to talk to you.  We will be getting some sub-
network numbers from St. Louis for us to distribute within Tymnet so we won't
have to register with SRI everytime we bring up a new subnet.

Anyway, I'm here this afternoon so please drop by.  Might want to bring Joe
if he is around and interested.

Joe,
  People here are complaining about getting hung off of D37, even in the
middle of jobs.  We noticed that OPER has run TAKEIT twice today (about
9:30 and 11:38).  I believe that this is not usual?  Do you know who in
Dallas operations might be a reasonable contact for complaints about this?
I hate to bother you, but don't know anybody in Dallas operations.

Thanks,

Subject: Killing jobs 

System D37 got down below 8000 pages free on disk.  Apparently LEHRMANN
killed a bunch of ^C jobs, which has a side effect of freeing up disk space.
The operator I talked to says that they have a policy of doing a TALK ALL
to warn users when space is critical; apparently that was not done today.
He says they will give warning if this situation reoccurs, and they ask
that unnecessary files be deleted so that it doesn't occur.    /Joe

P.S.  Anyone can call (214)
637-7435 and ask for "System 37 Operator".

The following proposal is submitted of the intended dates when the
remainder of the TYMCOM-10's are scheduled for conversion at the
Fremont Data Center.

     F58 - Weekend of 9 through 11 September

     F29 - Weekend of 11 through 13 November

     F38 - Weekend of 25 through 27 November

At the completion of this schedule all Fremont TYMCOM-10's
will be running on a PAGE vice BLOCK monitor  This will prevent
some confusion as to what type of monitor the systems are up on.
It will also cut down of remembering what PACKCOPY version to
use.  Instead of remembering FOUR version;s; only have to
remember TWO.

Please review and distribute this schedule to allow projects and
workloads to be planned accordingly.

If any of the systems poses a problem, please call me at (415)498-2595
as soon as possible and we can make arrangements to reschedule.
