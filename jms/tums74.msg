Re: TINGLE.EXE - great.
    We have two (2) choices.  1) Use (WRS)FTPTNX or FTP10X however he
   spelled it, or 2) ask operations to copy the file(s) via tape from
   office-1 username <carl> to say C29, username (CARL).
   Operations requests are made via the BATCH program... sigh.

Subject: Galaxy library and KERMIT

Bill Soley tells me that you may know about KERMIT and the GALAXY
library.  I have sources for TOPS-10 KERMIT in BLISS and MACRO.
Apparently they require GLXMAC.MAC otherwise known as GALAXY
for assembly.  I am interested in getting a copy of KERMIT
running because we have a customer who wants to be sure that
KERMIT will run on Tymnet, and may need to arrange a demo.
I have KERMIT running on the IBM, WANG, and NORTHSTAR pcs, and
have had some success running it via outdial to other hosts on
non-tymnet computers that way.
~p
Please let me know if you can help me with this.

Subject: BUG in MACRO 43 

I remember when the SPR came out to fix this bug.

File 1)	DSK:S.BAD	created: 1307 26-Jun-85
File 2)	DSK:S.MAC	created: 1531 26-Jun-85

****
2)11	IFIDN <CONT>,<.>,  <S$TEMP==0>;;	;Same as ".+1"

The first line does not assmble with MACRO 46, the 2nd one does.
MACRO 46 spaced out the 4th "<", and thought the 4th ">" was end of macro
definition, and started assembling the remaining lines.

Restriction: With MACRO 46 it is OK to put ">" after ";", but not "<".

Subject: Monitor changes 

Joe,
  I'd like you to put together a PCOM command file, whether it be done with
some sort of TECO macro or what... but something that will produce a set of
output files *.SCM or *.DIF (or something unique?) which can then be filed
with the transmittal or the MEM file to show all the changes made to all the
source files.
  I'd like to see an INCREMENTAL differences... such that

    COMMON.MAC <= COMMON.N13 <= COMMON.N12 <= COMMON.N11 <= COMMON.N06
    CORE1.MAC  <= CORE1.N12  <= CORE1.N10
    ONCE.MAC   <= ONCE.N12   <= ONCE.N02

We see for each module, differencs from the .N00 released monitor to present:

    COMMON.DIF <= {{.N00,.N06 + .N06,.N11 + .N11,.N12 + .N12,.N13 + .N13,.MAC}}
    CORE1.DIF  <= {{.N00,.N10 + .N10,.N12 + .N12,.MAC}}
    ONCE.DIF   <= {{.N00,.N02 + .N02,.N12 + .N12,.MAC}}

Maybe produce a single file... (N to P)
    P034NP.DIF <= {{ COMMON.DIF + CORE1.DIF + ONCE.DIF + ... }}

At least think about it.  Because we need some sort of control over the
changes after they've been done, as a review to insure thaat we have not
added any problems by mis-typing anything.

Subject: 12-bit node numbers 

Sigh... SYSTAT only reads up to node 3000!   That's why we see *6657* in
the systat listings.  FYI there are two places in SYSTAT that do a
  MOVEI M,3000   instruction then later CAMGE M,xxxxx to check the node
number.  I binary-patched (SYS:930)SYSTAT.SHR to  MOVEI M,7777  to test
it and "le voila" it now prints node names higher than 3000!

Oh, and since TYMNET may or may not have updated things... I wrote a
little program, DEFNOD which is in (TYMNET) that reads NODES.MAP and
does nice things to it.

It's basically DEFSYS/DEFPRI/DEFNOD hacked to work on the right file.
DEFSYS looks at (SYS)PERP.SYS,  DEFPRI looks at (SPOOL)NODPRI and now
DEFNOD looks at (TYMNET)NODES.MAP....

sigh... gee.. it's easy to write/modify programs which read binary files
and print out the entries, and modifies them... real easy... sigh...

Anyway... nodes should type out on 930 a little more sensibly now...
However, don't bother trying to transmit SYSTAT or anything like that
until we get the new 14-bit node standard implemented....

I've talked to Dave Smith, and since he was asked to co-ordinate with
me how to do the new standard, and the base gets it as a 16-bit word,
chances are that we will go to 2 8-bit bytes as I proposed the other
day.   (however, NOTHING will be done until the new bases are completely
deployed in the network and the varians are all gone!!!)

Peter Stratman has sent me mail indicating that they keep getting a
timeout from initia, and that initialization does not complete correctly.

I know that 2020's are NOT allowed to have CRSHID on (SYS) unless they
have the new initia (not available for 2020s at the moment).  However, I
do not think that this is their problem.

If we can check the BASE node number to see if they are running TYMNET-I
or TYMNET-II code, we may have an answer... or maybe not...

Joe, do you know what software you had to change on system 95 to get it
to do everything correctly?

Subject: SWITCH.INI package 

Please see (SPL:930)SWITCH.REQ, .SAI, .REL for a "small" sail routine
which reads switch.ini in most [sic "all"] it's glory.  It handles
continuation lines ok, but I believe comments in SWITCH.INI may not
work they way DEC expects.

It takes 3 arguments... Name, Option, PPNFlag.  It looks for a line
which starts:
  NAME     or
  NAME:OPTION   (if option is non-null)

and returns the line (or lines) as a single string, continuation lines
concatenated together minus the " -" at the end of the line(s).

See (SPL)WHEN for an example of it's usage. PPNFlag is true if you want
to read from the GFD'd ppn, otherwise it reads from your AUN (I think,
read the code to be sure).  It's a well-behaved program as far as
channels and break-table variables go... sigh.

Subject: 930 backups 


Since we are now without a COOP student to do the backups on system
930 we must have an alternative mechanism. After discussing with each
of you some suggested ways of handling the backups I am proposing
the following procedure in the interests of simplicity and reliability.
Each person in the list will have one day of the week assigned to
do incremental backups- this assignment will last "forever" and should
be easy to rememeber.  The monthly ALL FILES backup will rotate
across all memeb
across all members.

The winning assignments are:

Monday - Osman
Tuesday - Dan
Wednesday - Carl
Thursday - Joe
Friday - Bill

Monthly ALL FILES:

September - Dennis
October - Bill
November - Joe
December - Dan
January - Carl
February - Osman

See Osman if you have any questions about the procedure to follow.
Please do the incrementals at a regular time each day, say between
4 p.m. and 6 p.m.

If there are any problems with the assignments see me and we will
consider adjustments

You can now transfer files from a PDP-X to the FSC OnTyme account.
For this to work, modify or create the file ACCESS.ONT under your
PDP-X username as follows:

	USERNAME;EMSFSC
	ACCOUNT.FSC

That should do it.  If you have any problems with this, call me.

Gosh.  
The only one I can think to try is <WRS>;NOMINAL also maybe <WRS>;WRS
otherwise, it might be one of my "real" passwords, but I seriously doubt
I'd have done that on a system where they're storred in the clear.  As
for Ellen's packs, I think all you do is bring it up on a 2020 that's
connected to an LSI-11 base and go in and load the KMC somehow.  I
think there's a program like KMCLOD in <WRS> that you just run.  You'd
have to ask Ellen for more details, but she's left the company.  -Bill

   Subj:  PIR# 1903 - Your message A40652 & A40655

	The purpose of PIR 1903 is to expand CCT from currently 5-bit
   CCT to 6-bit CCT. With compatibility in mind, the new SUP will support
   one of the following login strings when the circuit is a half-duplex:
	1). 5-bit CCT plus control-H
	2). 6-bit CCT with bit 5 as half-duplex flag. (I adopt your naming
	convention here, where bit 7 and 6 are ignored, bit 4-0 are TID.)

	The second option is new. From the PDP-10 point of view there should
   not be any changes of CCT. The only difference is that the CONSAT has 
   options to specify the half-duplex circuit in the login string, as 
   described above.

	I will callwhen we test this feature in Bubbnet, so you can
   help us confirm the compatibility.

Subject: FCR.E+3/4 

I followed the code a little further...
  it goes as follows... the user is doing SIMIO output and ends up at
  SIMBOU:  no problems, @SIMBO1+15 does a PUSHJ P,DDO(T1) which does
  a JRST OUTBLT.    P1,T4 are put on the stack, SIMIOA returns with a
  page in  %UPT+UPTSIM(W), SIMIOB sets up the POS in J and %UPT+UPTPOS(W),
  NEDMAP (bit 20) is set so we see PUSHJ P,SIMIOM @OUBLT0+15.  [No idea
  about whether SIMRMV is called, but I doubt it else we couldn't get a
  #3 error from map-file-page.]  SIMIOM puts P1,P2 on the stack, NEDRMV
  is not set, cause we made it past the STOPCD.  IO was set in S, so we
  jump off to SIMIM1 for output.  GOTPHP is set, so we hurry down to
  SIMIM2 where we call SIMCRE to do the right stuff with the output file.
  That probably succeeds (since we know we got a MAPERR not a FCRERR) and
  we try to map the page @SIMIM3+2.  That fails with #3 %FLVEX (FALVEX)
  and we go into the literal that clobbers the page number and JSPs to
  MAPERR which clobbers the page number again and sets the UUO value to 1
  and scurries off to SIMIMF which pops P2,P1 back into place, sets up S
  from DEVIOS(F) and returns to  OUBLT0+15  which goes to SIMIOS which
  pops T4,P1 back from the stack.  T1 = UUO,,ERR  == 1,,3  is pushed on
  the stack for the UUO-range check.  Then at MAP.E/FCR.E it's popped
  back off the stack, mangled and checked...  we then hit our STOPCD at
  FCR.E+3 (old FCR.E+4).

Looking at the stack, it's clear that 1001,,3 is returned from the CHANIO
UUO (EPT+1,,PG)[suspicious no?]  and that we have some other clues to
verify this.
  %UPT+UPTIOC[ usecount  which is found in %UPT+UPTSIM(W)[ usecount,,501001
  and %UPT+UPTPOS(W)[ 11  which was also in DEVPOS(F).  We can now check
  the old FCR.E+4 crashes for lh[ UPTSIM(W) ]==UPTIOC to find out what page
  and status bits {GOTPHP,NEDRMV,NEDMAP,GOTHOL} are set.  In this case, the
  501001 says GOTPHP,NEDMAP,page 1001.  %UPT+UPTPBM[ 600000,,177777  which
  says ppp 1000 & 1001 are marked in use.

It's possible that more checks for NEDRMV are needed, or a non-faulting
test is needed to see if the page IS there even though NEDMAP is set?
I looked at SIMRMV and it looks like it makes sure that the page is gone
one way or the other... so we need to make sure that the page is NOT in
the indicated slot for that channel.  GOTPHP and USETO may play a part in
this too.  Need to insure that USETO will clear GOTPHP if the pos is less
than DEVPOS(F)/UPTPOS(W).   sigh.

Hope you can follow this commentary through the crash and dig up any new
leads on what to look at.  I've already spent too much time looking at it
instead of doing other things.  /Carl

is really APRINT+2 plus 3 from bits 0-1 == APRFAT+2 which is by a weird

were caused by a message type 15 (leave deferred echo mode) while there
were characters left to be echoed  LDBECC(U) ... Hmmmm.  Both crashes are
at DIEREH!  Both crashes have a completely different idea of how they got
to DIEREH... one was at TTYBMT (bad message type? how did it get here?)
if it was processing a stopcd?  and the other was in the null job!

Both had a CH1 in progress from the same location DIE1A+13... Hmmmm.

Joe?  any ideas?

  Subject  Tymcom-X monitor urgently required for S90 (P034P).
 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  We are currently involved in the process  of installing a Tymnet II base
  on  S90 (the  PDP10  installed here  in St.  Cloud).   Jack Snavely  has
  informed  us of  the  fact  that one  of  the  problems that  have  been
  detected, an  intermittent loss  of characters,  has been  solved on  US
  PDP10's by installing a recent release of the operating system.
 
  As this is one of the reasons why we have reverted to the Tymnet I base,
  and because of the  fact that we would like to test  the new software as
  much as possible, we would like to have the  new monitor release for S90
  very soon.
 
  It may, however, also be necessary  to update other system software. S90
  is currently still  running on a /K  monitor, and a lot  of software may
  have changed since. I  am not aware of what changes  may be necessary to
  move to a  /P monitor, (CUSPS, operator  procedures, user documentation,
  APL-related, etc).
 
  Could you give me the information I  will need to plan this upgrade cor-
  rectly ?  Tentatively, given  the current Tymnet  I elimination  date of
  Dec. 15th,  Tuesday night, Dec. 12th.   our time, seems  appropriate for
  the monitor  upgrade. (this  means the  day of  Dec. 12th.,  your time).
  Could you please confirm this schedule as soon as possible ?
 
  I can be contacted via ontyme on  ct.dpm, or mail to CTMKTG7:930, if you
  need more information or assistance.
 
  Best regards, Peter Stratman.

Subject: Re: Patch to avoid losing characters. 
In-reply-to: your message of Wed, 11 Dec 85 12:41:12 PST

I can produce on demand (using an internal circuit) gross and frequent
character lossage over a circuit:
  1. log in to host with new base
  2. build an internal circuit (to same host) with taux, auxio, mhx or anything
  3. do a DIR (SYS)/EVE or something to generate output
  4. wait - you'll see lots of garbage after a few hundred chars
I've been talking to Carl about it.  I'm convinced it happens on non-internal
circuits, although less frequently because of very poor (2*9.6KB) connect-
ivity of new bases to eachother.  I see 3-4 instances per week in the TUMS
log file.  I'm also convinced its a backpressure protocol problem.  The base
is not implementing a flow quota:
  * Never send more than XXX characters to a given port without completely
    emptying the host output ring in order to insure that no backpressure
    message has been sent.
The value for XXX is 32 (should be 30 or 34) for the ten.  I don't know what
it should be for the base, but it should essentially be the amount of buffer
space guarenteed to be available for a port after backpressure has been sent.
32 is a good guess, but it should be checked by looking at PDP-10 or Varian
code.  -Bill

I just talked to Dave Smith and he showed me a trace of base/host traffic
where the 10 is appearently not honoring the quota rule I mentioned in
the previous memo.  The code is clearly there, so it might not be working.
-Bill

It still seems that the base does not have the ability to honor the quota
since it doesn't buffer and the dispatcher doesn't honor quotas.  ???

Peter,

Carl Baltrunas tells me that he has patched the current P034/K Monitor on host
S90, to fix the character-loss bug.  This patch will allow host S90 to work
with the new base.  I'm sure that if Carl where not in a class he would be
giving you this information himself.

The P034/P monitor is not urgently needed for host S90, and thus other
software need not be changed to accomodate the new Tymnet-II base.

Someone in NTD sent validations a request to delete a list of users not

disappeared and he went to validations and stopped the purge...  I went
to check on 39 and found username (CARL) gone, and called validations to
see what happenned.

In all, 12 GAN 3 usernames were purged.  Bill and I made a list and gave
it to Jan Krivanek to have the accounts restored.  So, if you notice that
things on 39 are missing, ** Don't Panic ***,  they are being restored.

Of concern were: (BRING), (CARL), (DENCOFF), (FLETCHERC), (HELGEM), (JMS),
(SPL) and (TSUCOOP).  There were others, but of no consequence.

Jan assured me that she would put in the batch rquests to have operations
restore the file that were deleted.

Carl or Joe:
I've been trying to customize RPG for the SPOOL Operator username (SPPOPER) on
host 22 (among others).  I can successfully do what I need for the current
frame, but when I logoff and log back in the special processors and the do
list I established are no longer in my list, in spite of my having given the
command CTEST MAKINI after all my other CTEST commands.

The do list I get when I run TC after logging in contains MCH, SPL & MPL.  I
don't know how Mike's directory gets in there, and the other directories I
specified in my CTEST in my prior frame get deleted.  I use exactly the same
RPGINI.CTL with PCOM that I successfully used on the other hosts.  It appears
there's something unusual about host 22.  I don't understand the difference.

doesn't allow username:host/subhost as a valid format.  AUXIO
passes whatever you type, substituting username for (^P), i think,
but if you just say :host it loses, while ^P:host should work.

TAUX ought to be taught to to more checking, or less checking.
Sigh!

Subject: TUMS on 39 

I've changed the new log code to use HALT in place of FLEXIT until
I hear from you that FLEXIT is okay.  This may be a problem because
I'm not sure that HALT will logout on detach, so please hurry.  In
the process of checking things out, I got two more fail exits and the
system stayed up so it doesn't seem to happen every time.  Let me know
if I can help track it down by trying to reproduce it or anything.

Meanwhile, TUMS seems to be back on the air on 39.  A bunch of mail
was probably returned to sender due to my incompetence, but it
is probably not much.  It would be only messages waiting to be sent out
from 39 but couldn't due to system down or something - maybe none.

Thanks for renaming the files, it was probably the only appropriate
solution under the circumstances.

Subject: FLEXIT reliability 

I have a test program put together to test Bill's FRMRUN routine, but I
think that he's using a newer SAIL version than I have.  I need to obtain
the source that he's using and incorporate it into the test program to
reliably attempt to simulate the same environment MAIL is using.

I'd take a look at the crashes and try to determine which locks were NOT
released and see where they were gotten.  Apparently someone called by
FLEXIT isn't following convention.  Or FLEXIT isn't!

If Bill responds today and I get back on tonight, I will put together the
test code so that we can test FLEXIT.

Bill,
  Can you "guess" at what environment we are looking at?  Things such as
what files were open at the time, in what mode(s), etc...  Since we're
getting used to SUMUUF dying with bad file info, maybe someone else isn't
releasing locks for the same kind of causes...

  Are you using (SAILIB)FRMRUN  or ?????

Subject: BIONIC on (SYS) 

I want to wait a week (total of 2 weeks) from the time it was put on
(FTSYS).   If ONLY system 55 is affected, and Terry wants to inform
people that she's asked for a pre-release and to contact her in case
of problems, then it is OK for Dennis Coffey to move it to (SYS) on
that system, (or for Dennis to have Ingrid "officially" move it).

My belief is that NONE of Terry's customers are having the zero-records
problem, and that is the only thing that the new version fixes, that was
broken.  If ANY of her customers are still getting zero-records when they
in fact have date, then that too is cause for putting up the new version
on system 55.  [Most of her support is for people using VS3780].

Subject: ONCALL working again 

I moved some code and that seemed to fix the problem (assuming that it
didn't cause some other more obscure problem).  Anyway, it defaults the
list from ONCALL.RES in the proper order, and when ONCALL.SCH exists it
builds the table in the order Joe,Osman,Carl.  So, at the moment, I've
copied the .SCH file as .SCN so we get Joe,Carl,Osman which is the order
that we're using for the moment.

It may work to actually schedule in the .SCH file the correct order and
let it take it from there....

Subject: Obscure INFO command 

Since we're playing with trees and our own names of things I though
you'd be interested in this.

The BUILD command takes as argument, a pointer to the info tree.
If the master file INFO.DAT already exists (even if empty) then
it will be built in your own directory.  If the master file does
NOT exist, then INFO.DAT will be written to the master directory
(INFO).  So, to create your own INFO tree...

1)  Create INFO.DAT empty.
2)  Create your info tree file X.Y with main menu Z.
3)  Run INFO
4)  enter "BUILD X.Y:Z"
5)  watch it build.

Your main menu does not need to be called "ROOT".  If no arguments
are supplied the program uses "INFO.NFO:ROOT".

I plan to change this slightly in preparation for the tree selection
code which will allow multiple trees.  Probably some sort of search
for .DAT files and reading the first lines... anyway, when this is
done the name of the tree X.Y will cause it to look for X.DAT instead
of INFO.DAT as it does now.

  Ken, receive my apologies for answering so late to your December memo.
 
  1.  Oper names  for host 930 to  access INFO database: copying  930 INFO
      database to system 90  will not work. System 90 is  due to be defin-
      itively taken out of the network way before the end of 1986
 
      System 74 (accounting host) might be a better choice
 
      We need essentially EVERYTHING that exists in the INFO database
 
      Removing RF from 930  does not seem practical: as far  as I can tell
      this is used both to access INFO database and to access monitor code
      when weing for a replacement
 
  2.  Accessing on host 74 the Validation database: we will be using user-
      name CTOPSMGR and oper names JAY or STRATMAN (the latter to be vali-
      dated)
 
      Files accessed are: USERDB.DMS, CUSTDB.DMS, ADDRDB.DMS
 
  3.  Current status  of the  project: we  are running  January accounting
      cycle with your and our data in  parallel. We will let you know when
      we do not need your data any more
 
      We can  give you a royalty  report containing connect,  tru (without
      pru), pru (as a separate amount) for prime, nonprime and batch time.
 
      Please provide  a list  of royalty codes  as viewed  by MIS  and the
      relationship between each royalty code and the corresponding code in
      the TYMCOM/370  raw accounting. After reviewing the TYMCOM-370 moni-
      tor notes,  it seems that the  corresponding TYMCOM-370 code  can be
      one of the following raw accounting fields:
 
          Accounting record type 5, field  "PREMPGNM" for the royalty code
          and field "PREMPRU" for the pru amount
 
          Accounting record type 9, field "TRNSPGNM" and field "TRNSCHGS"
 
      Please indicate what kind of record layout you need for your royalty
      data
 
  I hope this answers your questions.
 
    Regards,
    Eric
 
  PS: special note  for Patrice de Beranger: the royalty  report will have
  to be  taken from your  data and sent  to Ken  BeDell. Since we  (YM and
  myself) provide you with detailed data you  are the only one in position
  to provide this report, since you do the totaling

Ken,

      Eric referred to two items to which I can (should?) provide answers:

1.)  PERP replacement:  the project is our number two priority, and should be
completed within about one month (my rough estimate--I'm not directly
involved in it at this time).  We are confident that this is poenty of time
prior to the date expiration of the 940s.

2.)  OPER license access on 930:  Eric's point about the plans to take system
90 out of the network well before the end of the year is news to me, and is a
very valid point.  Their need to access monitor code on 930 will be taken
under advisement.  No answer to this problem immediately, but soon.

Carl,

In reference to the previous memo from Bill Soley about PCOM, do you
think you will get a new copy of PCOM on 70 by tommorrow?  I have a lot
of testing to do and was going to come in early.  I won't bother if the
new version of PCOM is not out there (on 70).

Also it seems that the terminal emulation program on the rainbow (TRM)
does something unusual when uploading files onto the DEC's.  It seems to
hang on control charactors.  do you know anything about this or how to
stop it?  Any interesting info you have on the use of the rainbow and
the DEC's would be greatly appreciated!  I just got this rainbow and have
found many useful features, and severe limitations.  For example what
are the optimal host settings in TRM for PDP interaction?  If you don't
use TRM, could you send me a copy of whatever you use? I could really
use any utilities for the rainbow that you have. 

Thanks, Dan

Joe,
  can you answer this message.  You have more info available about the

The version of PCOM on 70 is old and doesn't implement license
passing.  Until a new version of PCOM is transmitted to 70, I
have redeclared MERLIN so you shouldn't need any license.  This
is only a temporary fix because next transmittal of MERLIN will
cause the protection to revert.  Hopefully, it will hold out
until the new PCOM arrives on 70.  Let me know if it doesn't work.
[Carl: has the latest PCOM been transmitted?]
-Bill

About uploading files from a Rainbow...I'm not a rainbow user,
but I use TYMCOMM which has built in file transfer.  If you just
want to send a text file, it is probably best to use the BIONIC
program on the 10.

	-r bionic
	*run
	INPUT FILE NAME: foo
	READY FOR INPUT
	(send file here, then wait 20 seconds)
	1 RECORDS INPUT
	EXIT
	-

The file won't be echoed, it will be recorded faithfully in the file
you specified.  There is no EOF character, it just waits for 20
seconds without data (so you can use all 128 characters).  It uses
block input and should be faster than anything else (including TUMS).

Still, there is yet a better way - KERMIT.  I don't know if there is
a KERMIT running on the 10 though.  [Carl: what do you use on your
Rainbow for file transfer?]

KERMIT can of course be used by having KERMIT record the output from the
10 into a file.  From the Rainbow, BIONIC sounds like a good idea.  We do
not yet have any KERMIT running on the 10s at the moment.  We don't do
much in the way of transferring back & forth from our rainbows.  Joe Smith
<JMS@C930.Tymnet> will probably eventually get around to making KERMIT for
the PDP-10 work, but not in the next few months.

Subject: BAD SYSUFD PATCH 

Correction:  The patch to turn off the weird SYS:.UFD = (UFD).UFD does
what we expected... however, we didn't expect that some old accounting
programs actually used that "feature"/"bug" and thus, we cannot patch
it at the moment.

   I went around to most of the Dallas machines with the new /P-8 monitors
and in an effort to just "get it done before I forgot again" I put the
instructiuon  "CAME T1,MFDPPN" back where it was patched out of both the
running /P-8 monitors and (SYS)NEWMON on
  27, 31, 37, 56 and 65.   Just fixed (SYS)NEWMON on 25, 72 and 79.

DID NOT FIX systems 23 and 54 since they were unavailable for some reason
at this time.  Someone (OSMAN,JOE) please check them and un-do the SYSUFD
patch:

  FILUUO$:   CHKPP1+2/ JFCL 0   <== replace with CAME T1,MFDPPN

I did NOT update P-8 to P-8 because I was in a hurry and don't feel all

I will probably NOT be in early today....  I've finished a REFSTR that
works as best as the packs will let it.  (It created SPAGES.SYS just fine,
but I think DSKCLN didn't like 2 pages in the file and marked them as
holes in the rib, [I donno what it did to the pages in the SATs]).  I built
a 3-pack system, dumped a bunchof files to it from 930, and thinned the
files down a little.

There's a "working" skeleton system on 24 now... not everything works...
for example, TELECOPY works pulling, but not pushing?  May be a base bug,
but don't depend on it!  SPOOL is not expected to work, etc...

I didn't write a boots, and am not worried about it at present.... we need
to do that Osman,...  

Most of the MONITOR utility programs and such are out there...

  (SYS) has some compilers, etc, PEAK, VUE, TECO, ...RPG, PIP, DIRIT, etc.
 (FTSYS) has TECO 124a, and a few updated things, eg MACRO %53B
  (OSU) has some tools, some things that were in (WRS)
  (MPL) has more tools
 (CARL) and (JMS) have various copies of other things & DEC programs.
 (PJ) has a jOBS.DAT FILE but there is no (TYMNET) files.

Good night....

OSMAN will make an all-files of this system then overwrite it by making
the biggest 3650 system he can without wiping out our 2 1-pack systems.

Subject: (TYMNET)NODES.MAP updated for 14-bit node numbers. 

NODES.MAP is now 96 pages long - it has a 3-word entry for all 16834 possible
14-bit node numbers.  All nodes that do not have an explicit name now have
a 9-character implicit name.  The implicit name consists of a space, a hyphen,
the 5-digit node number (from 00000 to 37777), another hyphen, and another
space.  The program (TYMNET)DEFNOD does not list implicit names so that
it is easier to see the defined node names.

Now that the fully expanded NODES.MAP has been telecopied to all systems,
SYSTAT won't get into a loop anymore.  SYSTAT currently does not even attempt
to look for the name of any mode above 7777, which is OK since the base passes
only 12 bits to SCNSER (for LDBLOG).

Try running SYSTAT (with license set) on a "real" system to see the new names.

I think it is because F38 has two 3672 control units and four 3673 string
controllers.  This means that 4 disks can be seeking to a new cylinder at
the same time, and 2 disks can be searching for ID= at the same time.
C24 has only 1 control unit and 2 string controllers.

  In addition to modifying SYSTAT's table, there are two functions in the

Command code A4 is READ AND RESET BUFFERED LOG.  When the disk controller
sees this command, it returns the 24 sense bytes corresponding to whatever
disk unit got an error.  This function works for any disk controller that
talks to the SA-10 (ie, it is not specific to the 3650).  I'm not sure what
.FSETS is supposed to do, but .FSRRL works as is.

Subject: 26: BPA1/BPA10 == DSKB5 

Joe,
  The reason that this happens is that the BPA1 is a left subset of
BPA10 and since there is no BPA1 at the moment (powered off) it picks
the first unit that matches... i.e. BPA10 and returns DSKB5.  As for
DSKB1 (BPA15) and DSKB11 (BPA2) both returning BPA2, again this is
doing the same thing... it's searching the physical tables for a left
subset and stops when it finds a match.  *** THIS IS A BUG ***  It
ought to check for exact matches first, then if it cannot find one
return the left subset.

  I manually checked each unit, and got the correct results in BPA
order.  SY checks using logical device names.  If Osman had not reversed
the order of the logical units and the physical units, this would never
have shown up!  Osman did a good thing!!!  It means we need to fix it
at some point.

Unknown as to how that will work.... I've obsconded with a copy of SMITII
and it is in (SMITHDE) which seems to be the only place that it will run
from without logging you out.  So, if 930 & 6657 is up, we can load from
there, and after copying it to 62, we should be able to go the other way
with some ease.  TELECO works fine through the gateway, and LOADII will
go through a gateway, but I do not know the procedure.

System 57 is a backup of some fo the code on 39, but (CURR11) and (NEW11)
are not backed up anywhere as far as I know.  maybe we should also find
the reason whay we cannot load 6657 from 930... I believe it has somethng
to do with CIOPR... sigh.  History bites us again!

Subject: Maze of twisty passages 

Following the code for USETI and IN chanios, just starting in IOCSS at
the dispatch table, winding it's way to FILUUO's DSKDSP table, not always
the same index, possibly recursive, bouncing through SIMIO, IOCSS, FILUUO
and MAPIO is enough to give someone a case of claustrophobia... even a
headache...

Anyway, it appears the UUOs probably work fine in their present form.  So,
someplace after the data has been placed in the LMA chains and it get's
"pulled" into memory by FILIO or some other entity, a register must be
getting clobberred... maybe even while in the UUO and it's waiting for a
response back from the actual I/O stuff.  Anyway, I followed the UUO part
without finding anything where it "could" go wrong.

U is setup from DEVSUP which contains 0 (if a STR) or the UDB (if a unit).
I'm not clobbering U in the UUO.  STRPPU is used both as a divisor and as
a multiplier to find the right unit or check the highest page on the STR.
UNIPPU is checked if mapping a range of pages (which DSKCLN is not!).  I'm
calling it quits for tonight, will look for a register getting clobbered
in FILIO, PCBIO or SWAMP in the morning...

Things followed out, DSKCHR uuo works [FILUUO], CLOCK1 watchdog on disk
space should be OK (or we'd crash once a minute?). I haven't tried the new
SYSSTR UUO but will before I log off.... from what you saw, any ideas?

Apparently, EXEC is doing CHANIO ac,P1  (in SIMIOM code), user had done
a .CHIN CHANIO  (monitor was doing a .CHSMP) ... and it was waiting ...
The monitor got into FILIO... I need to see the crash PDL. Sigh!

      I've received a phone call from Tymnet:  FSC's access to Tymnet in this
building, both for terminals and for our hosts, is not 'legal'.  I.e., Payment
Systems Co.  pays for the engines in this building and for the synchronous
network line to connect to the public network.  Pmnt. Sys. Co.  is billed by
Tymnet for this service.  We do not pay for it at all.  I am told, by Tymnet,
that our traffic "degrades Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s service", and that our use of
service purchased by another company is not allowed.

      I have discussed this with Pat Diamond, and he has agreed to handle the
solution of this problem.  He and I discussed some alternatives, and the
suggestion which he said he will persue most strongly includes:  the
installation on site here (as a 'lab' machine--self installed) of a Tymnet
Engine that FSC owns; and upgrading the line(s) (from here to Solar Way) which
Pmnt. Sys. Co.  'owns', from 9.6 Kbps to 14.4 Kbps.

      Our lab machine would be the pass-through connection for our micro-
Tym-Bases and would provide any terminal connections we might need to take off
Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engines.  The only traffic that Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engine
will have may be pass-through traffic.  We could share costs for the lines
with Pmnt. Sys. Co., connecting one line to their machine and the other to
our machine.  Pat tells me that this would probably provide service MUCH more
quickly than ordering new phone service from Pac. Tel., and--if Sal Spinelli
of Pmnt. Sys. Co. agrees--be less expensive.

      Pat tells me that he will contact Sal next week:  Sal is in Irvine this
week, but next week will be available at Tymnet, Orchard Parkway.  He will be
in meetings there next week about their network access problems, but be able
to be reached by the Tymnet operator.

Subject: Network access change: Liberty. 

      Discussion of this pending change with Joe Smith has shown this to be an
opportunity:  if we get the lab node, we could have an ISIS machine which
would allow an Async Host Interface TYMCOM slot, as well as a Async Terminal
Interface CONSAT slot.  The Host Interface slot could allow us to bring the
the 2020 (host 95) into the network quickly, plus we could put the consoles
for the hosts on them -- allowing us to use the consoles remotely (through
network sub-addressing).

      Another alternative could be connecting to the Albrae St.  location.
This could provide redundancy, if this were in addition to the lines discussed
previously.  If we order any lines, I believe ordering directly from Pac.
Tel. will will be significantly less expensive than ordering from Tymnet.
Tymnet's monthly charge for service between here and Solar Way:  Tymnet's
monthly charge would be over $700 -- the advantage they offer is Tymnet
Network Control's reporting of and follow up on the line outage.

      Pat suggested another cost-saving alternative for redundancy from our
engine to the network:  a dial-up Network sync line, rather than a 4-wire
dedicated line.

Subject: Using the GATEWAY command in TELECOPY. 

To TELECOPY files to or from system 39, you have to start on a PDP-10 on the
public net, build a gateway to BUBBNET, then copy the files.  The host numbers
of the gateways are: 5946, 1461, 1579, 5516, 5981, 1552, 2866, 3171, and 7255.
For example:

	.R TELECOPY
	: GATEWAY 7255;JMS:39
	Password <password for JMS on BUBBNET>
	: (*6NEWS:39)TELECO.DOC,(JMS:930)		;Pull a file from 39
	: (JMS:930)SWITCH.INI,:39			;Push a file to 39
	: QUIT

The gateway host numbers are listed in (*6NEWS)BUBNET.DOC on most PDP-10 systems.

Subject: 3650 disk project. 

Remaining items in the 3650 project:                    17-Mar-86

1) Verify that APT10 works.  It is designed to transfer files between the
   TYMCOM-X system and KLDCP DECtapes via the CTY.  Use it to put SA10NW on
   a DECtape.   This requires a standalone KL, brought up in CONSOLE mode.

2) Determine why the paper-tape version of BOTLOD does not work like the version
   in MONBTS.  This requires a standalone KI with 3650 disks for complete veri-
   fication, although most of the work could be done on C24 with Ampex disks.

3) After the KI version of BOTLOD works, put the KL version on the DECtapes
   using APT10.  This can be done during a scheduled downtime.

4) Determine where PAKCP5 fails when writing the secondary HOM and BAT pages.
   This is the only thing keeping the COPY command from working.  This requires
   standalone time on the CPU with 3650 disks, not more than one weekend.

5) Make a single version of PAKCOPY that understands 3675 in blocks and pages.
   This means that the size of the areas used for channel command lists need to
   be determined at run time, not as an assembly option.  This can be done on
   C24 with Ampex disks.

6) Locate the routines in the monitor that assume that all units of a structure
   are the same size.  Determine whether it is feasible to have a DSKB composed
   of a mixture of packs formatted in blocks and in pages.

7) Modify BOOTS to understand all 4 disk types.  Right now, "BOOTS" understands
   3675 blocks only, and "BOOTX" understands 3650 pages only.  This requires
   standalone time on C24 with Ampex disks, and can be verified on C26
   during a scheduled reload of the system.

8) Add a command to BOOTS telling it which set of packs to look at.  This is so
   that a one-pack test system can be kept spinning and not confuse the Monitor
   by having two packs claiming to be "DSKB0".  This will have a side effect of
   making BOOTS much faster in loading the monitor, and can be done on 930.

9) Install 2nd upgraded SA10 for continued testing on C24.

10) Add code to PAKCP5 that can rewrite HA/R0 on 3650.  I have disassembled the
   relevant portions of SA10NW.SAV, and will put them in PAKCOP.MAC.  Testing
   requires days of standalone time on C24 with new SA10 and 3650 disks.

11) Merge PAKCP5 with the pages version of 3675 PAKCOP.

12) Determine whether bad blocks really work.  Verify that PAKCOPY assigns
    alternate tracks correctly.  Make it look at the BAT block that SA10NW
    creates.  Make the monitor add new entries when it discovers bad pages.

%FROM: Per_Lindberg_QZ@ODEN

Have I told you about the large computer now installed and running at
Stacken, the computer club at the KTH (the Royal Institute of
Technology) in Stockholm? No? Well, then...

A few years ago, DEC (Digital Equipment Corp) in Sweden had a sort of
"white elephant" on their hands, a DECsystem-10 (the same type you are
running COM on), but a very old model with a KA10 CPU, single
transistor logic boards and good old core memory. Big as hell, lots of
blinkenlights, and with an appetite for kiloAmpere that would ruin any
computer hobbyist. The customer that had leased the thing did not want
it any more, and DEC did not even try to find another. But instead of
scrapping it, they gave it to us in Stacken. Sure, we could take care
of it, and even payed the transport (about 3000 SEK). But where would
we house such a beast? Fortunately, KTH promised us a place to run it.
For two years it was kept in a garage at KTH while we lobbyed the KTH
administration to give us that place. (There is a constant shortage of
space at KTH, alas). It was not after a new guy in Stacken, Peter
Lothberg, had renewed the efforts by pestering the Principal himself
for a while that we finally got the promised room to install it in.

Then around last spring (1985) the work started. During the summer of
1985 the place was refitted with a real raised computer room floor,
electrical power, terminal lines, a cooling machine with outdoor
condensors, and everything else needed to make the place a
full-fledged computer center.

Meanwhile, our DEC-10, now named "KATIA" (a pun on "Nadja" which is
the DEC-2020 at KTH and "KA-TIA", where "tia" is 10:er in swedish),
was temporary installed and tested at CCCC (Colossal Cave Computer
Center), Peter:s playroom where he already has a DECsystem-10 going.
That DEC-10, (named KICKI) was used for testing and debuggning Katia.
Without it, it might still be nonfunctional.

When the room was finished, Katia was moved in and re-debugged. (You
don't move such a beast without dislocating at least a few wires). And
then, one night last autumn, the champagne bottle, which had been
bought for just this reason, was opened. Katia was installed, and up
and running! According to the tradition, which begun with the
installing of Kicki a year eariler, the bottle is uncorked when you
can give the command MAKE LOVE on the console, which makes a file
named "LOVE" with the venerable TECO editor, and get the resonse "NOT
WAR?" on the console. (This is a "hack" in TECO, installed for obvious
reasons long ago, probably way back in the sixties).

Then on the 23rd of October 1985 Katia was officially inaugurated as
Stacken was throwing its first Big Party in its 7-year history, where
participants could awe at the extremely rare sight of over 100
computer hobbyists, nerds and hackers in (get this!) ties and jackets
(some of them even pinstriped!) The members and a large number of
specially invited dignitaries met at a splendid Dinner With Everything
at the KTH student corps house. Speeches were held, glasses were
raised, jokes were cracked and the atmosphere was high. After the
coffee everyone walked over to the room where Katia stood happily
humming since a few days, where the Principal inaugurated Katia by
cutting a punched tape spanned across the door.

Such a project can't be done without two things: many highly skilled
enthusiasts and a lot of money. Fortunately, Stacken had both. The
latter came from selling copies of our EMACS workalike editor "AMIS"
for about 500 USD a copy to other installations of DEC-10s, VAXen,
PR1MEs and Norsk Data. AMIS was our first success back in 1980, when
me and six others got fed up with not having a really good editor.
(I'm using it right now for writing this text). So AMIS, aside from
preventing us from going berserk, gave us the means to install Katia.

By the way, we can use more hardware. All sorts of donations are
appreciated. Especially disks, but we'll take anything that could
possibly be connected to a DECsystem-10. Also terminals, cooling
machines... anything. Send inquiries to me, or better still, to:
Datorforeningen Stacken, c/o NADA, KTH, S-10044 Stockholm, SWEDEN.

Katia is a neat hobby computer. Those kids and their daddys with
CBM-64:s can go suck on a BASIC manual. The DEC-10 is a REAL COMPUTER,
36 bit words, real tape, disks, DECtapes and a glorious collection of
blinking lights. It runs the TOPS-10 timesharing operating system, one
of the finest and most user-friendly OS ever made (it beats both VMS
and UNIX singlehandedly), rivalled only by TOPS-20. And the awesome
sight of Katia:s 12 large blue cabinets with the blinking lights, its
designed front panel and the rest of the hardware filling the room
stirs the heart. Katia looks like a computer should! This machine and
its worshippers are not unlike the phenomenon of people lovingly
restoring old steam engines and cars. But while Katia definitely is a
veteran computer, it's still modern. It outperforms a medium-sized VAX
and has a much neater instruction set. (Long live the DECsystem-10
designers!) And there are gigabytes upon gigabytes with highly
sophisticated software which we can run on it. Our only problem so far
is what to do with all those unused CPU cycles.

Anyone wants a million prime numbers?


(Text 16633)------------------------------


[Actually the MAKE LOVE trap is in COMPIL and in the old days when tops20
 exec still had the compil interface in it, you could get the not war
 response on tops20 as well. Although this code has been conditionalled out
for some time it was only with tops20 version 5 that it went alltogether.
A sad day !! To the maintainers of PCL : If goto hell on the dec10 responds
with get stuffed can't we have something like that or better under tops20 ?

Subject: Writing fixed length 8-bit ASCII records to tape. 

This is in answer to Roe's question of how to write a tape on the DEC-10 to
be turned into microfiche (such as the full-save listings).

	.R CHANGE

This will create a tape written in ASCII with fixed length records, a record
size of 132, one record per block, unlabelled.

Subject: LOGON and SWITCH.INI 

It is "nice" that LOGON will let you select options based on node-port
or simply node.  TYMNET nodes on the otherhand do NOT, (I repeat, do NOT)_,
report the physical port number anymore.  Not just the micro-nodes... all
TYMNET nodes are that way...  so, physical port number is meaningless in
99.9 percent of the cases.  (On a micronode,connected to a host, it has a
little meaning, by co-incidence).  The port reported is more likely the
circuit number reported to ISIS (or it's look-alikes).

So,  please don't feel that you are having problems with LOGON if you
cannot get it to select on a specific port.  TYMNET isn't really reporting
the physical port to the host anymore.  The Node information IS correct if
you are coming from a real node, and sometimes is a lie for internal circuits
on a micro-node host.  All "real" circuits, are supposed to be correct.

Sigh!

Symptom:  SPOOL not running, SPLFIX gets a fatal error on file SPOOL.GBK
        Renaming files, wait...
        LOOKUP failed for (SPOOL)SPOOL.GBK.
        Fatal error.
        Enabling SPOOL . . . Enabled.
         Can not continue !
        Please call the TYMCOM-X Support Line : (408) 446-6709

Diagnosis: SPLFIX had created SPOOL.GNW, SPOOL.FNW, and SPOOL.MNW.  The files
        SPOOL.MBK and SPOOL.FBK were dated 28-Feb-86 but SPOOL.GBK did not
        exist (maybe DSKCLN deleted it).  SPLFIX thought it needed to find
        this BAK file just so it could delete it.

Cure:   "COPY SPOOL.GDF,SPOOL.GBK", "RUN (UTIL)SPLFIX".  Done.

Note:   Carl and I both agree that this is not really a hotline problem.
        Maybe we need another policy for this kind of support on weekends.
        Anyway, SPLFIX needs to be changed so that it does not use the old phone
        number.

Woke up at 3:56 Monday morning with the bed shaking.  KGO says it was 5.6 on
the Richter scale, epicenter at Del Val Lake, between Fremont and Livermore.
No damage, some knick-knacks fell off the shelf, and the cuckoo clock started.
All the PDP-10s are up (except 74); I expected to find some down due to disks
powering down.

Subject: CONSAT/TYMCOM class. 

I am in the TTE 235 class until Friday.  I cam across some interesting info.

SUB HOST ADDRESSING - Allows a user to connect to a particular line or set of
lines on a TYMCOM (async host interface).  Selection is based on two 
characters in the username.  For instance, "TRAINING78", "TRAINING75", and
"TRAININGKL" would allow connection to the 780 host, the 750 host, or the
KL host.

PORT ADDRESSING - Allows a host (or user) to connect to a particular line
on a CONSAT (async terminal interface).  Selection is based on digits after
a period in the host number.  For instance, "JMS:931.19" and "JMS:123.1".
Each addressable line can have many HOST.NUMBER combinations assigned to it.
Any host can seize an addressable port as long as no one else is using it.
These lines can also be used to log in from.

Addressing features must be enabled on a line by line basis in the TYM file.

Subject: Port Addressing 

{sigh} Yes, this is exactly what I've been talking about for our CONSAT to
put in each data center so that we may login to the KLINIK lines on our KLs.

JMS:DALLAS.27  or JMS:984.27  etc. ... it would be nice if they could be
username:KLINIK.27  or  :KLINIKC.33  :KLINIKF.28  :KLINIKD.25 ???

I've been calling this subhost addressing, similar to :TYMNET/930.4  where
the .4 probably doesn't work... Dennis can give us port numbers on a uNode
if we can give him a host number to assign to it...  eg. :118.4 to use on
a printer port or some such.

I prefer this to KLINIK57 as the usrname....

      The reason for their use of LOADII is to re-load the node code for the
micro-Tym-Bases in the "micro-network" (currently 5 nodes) which supports the
unit's lab hosts.  These hosts (930, 62 and 95) are used for development and
testing of the Operating System and utilites for Tymcom-X hosts.  The hosts
from which we will need to run LOADII are those on which the micro-Tym-base
code is developed and stored:  39 and 57.  The users are:

In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 31 Mar 86 15:39:27 PST

We can't use :DALLAS since host numbers are numeric only.  If the CONSAT in
Dallas was host 1234, then we could define a username KLINIKD with a home of
1234.  To get to 25's CTY, we would have to use KLINIKD:.25;KLNIKD-PASSWORD
or JMS:1234.25;JMS-PASSWORD.

Addressable ports are not supported on solo TYMSATs like 3143 and 3146; they
need an ISIS CONSAT.  We could experiment with them by connecting the 2020 to
the micro Engine.  All we need is permission to use node 4605 and get another
host number assigned to it (it currently has kernel host 4079 and accounting
host 18927).  There is an option in the TYM file that will suppress node
generated text messages, such as "please log in:" and "see your rep...", the
documentation is not clear as to whether this affects messages like "error,
type password" and "host down".

It sounds like we should get Validations to assign us 5 more host numbers for
use at Liberty Street.

       -  C24 to be moved to an available PDP10 in Northern
          California or taken out of service.


The  Tymnet  and Ontyme groups will need to determine what to  do
with network and outdial equipment located in  Bldg.  'A'.   Also
maintenance will be canceled on the 940 hardware on their removal
date from service;  but all equipment should be left in place and
declared excess on 12/86.

School to all ISG employees.  The school will be held at the
TTE facility in San Jose, California on May 5-8, 1986.

Not only will the school better acquaint you with TYMNET in
general, but it also will provide you with knowledge of what
services and products TYMNET provides as a Value Added Network.
As a leader in the data communications field and as an integral
part of ISG, we know that many of you would like to know some-
thing about us.

We encourage those wishing at attend to enroll as soon as possible

Dallas Operations, Tyrone Hill, (214) 637-7435, System 27.

Problem: PFLLDC crashes, system stays up between 4 min and 2 hrs.
	 Also, DIEREH intersperced over the past 3 days.

Analysis: Nothing positive, system was crashing at PFLLDC in CORE1.
	  Both J and Job reported 0.  Stack showed EXCMPE probably
	  fell into USRFLT then xct PFLLDC at USRFLT+3.  I patched
	  the running monitor & system.sav to determine if the STOPCD
	  was caused by null-job or non-zero LDC.. Added PFLNUL in
	  patch area & system crashed at PFLNUL a while later...

Solution: Still unknown, Steve Atwell in Dallas maintenance tried
	  swapping various boards, the latest were E/UBR and address
	  decoders and after the PFLNUL crash the diagnostics finally
	showed a positive fault in the PI clock interrupt and they
	took over to run diagnostics about 18:00.  Will call me at
	home if it starts crashing again after fixing the problem.
	They feel it is definately HW but wanted help in pin-pointing
	the problem.  (they had replaced all of the pager boards and
	the problem still wouldn't go away).

Well, I finally got everything loaded with the code from (new11:57) or
(dernst:57) whichever was newest...

    throughput is atrocious at the moment, from home, long turnaround
    time... makes me think I'm using GTE's TELENET?

Here's the scoop:

    6657 loads fine with LOADII, only one problem (see below).

    6760 had some cards jumpered wrong, DLV11-J was either bad or had
	 the jumpers address and interrupt vectors setup NOT for the
	 console; DUV11 were switched wrong for TYMNET and for uNet.
	 After fixes, it loaded fine with LOADII.  (did not check to
	 see if co configuration links were correct)  However, it seemed
	 to think that host 95 wasn't there.... (see below).

    2346 would not load through 6657 or 10115 using NODLOD at first.
	 jumpers were wrong for DLV11-J, reset them and console worked.
	 as a last resort I pulled the DRV11 cables out for 6657 and
	 flipped them over and swapped J1 & J2.  It loaded fine from
	 6657 after that.  I attempted the same swap with the DRV11 to
	 10115 and met with similar results (loading went ok).  But...
	 although it loaded from 10115, the link between 10115 and 2346
	 never stayed up (if it ever came up), same if loaded from 6657.
	 If I attempted to login to :930, I got the message "host not
	 available through net", yet... it let me login to XRAY:st@6657
	 and XRAY:st@2770 without any trouble.

   10115 loaded fine with LOADII, and seemed to be configured ok. Seemed? 
	 becuse attempts to login to 930 or 95 were met with the weird
	 message "NET940/111 circuit cleared" which we have seen before.
	 Also, it never connected with 2346 even though it could load it!
	 this "NET940/111" message also comes from 6760... did we lose our
	 group and class status for these nodes again?

The load device... Ok Dennis, fine when I ^C out of NODLOD that I have to
    reload or restart 6657 to get rid of the "*" busy status... but when I
    finish loading 2346 and it says "F" status, then wait awhile and it
    turns into "*" without me doing anything and the "*" won't go away for
    a long time (if ever), and I want to load 10115 from 930 through 6657
    and 2346, now what do I do????  The same thing happens if I load 2346
    from 10115.  The load device stays busy for a long time and I can't even
    reload the same node if I crash it or swap boards or some such...


I think I covered everything...  I cannot spend any more time on this problem
at the moment!  I also cannot put up with any more downtime for system 62.
Joe & Dennis, can you work on getting these things to talk to each other?  I'd
appreciate it if you could keep 10115 up (but if you can work on that part of
the problem first, today...wednesday is a good time to work on 10115 and 2346
while I'm taking my long lunch with the old TYMCOM-X group.

The whole focus of this network is to allow access to our machines from each
other without going through TYMNET nodes... it would be nice if we could do
at least that much...

The DUV11 links need some attention to make sure that they have
the proper cros-ovrs and such... it seems that 2346 thinks the link to
6760 is NX ?   10115 should think it's link to 6760 is NX but not the
one from 2346!  Sigh!

Carl,

   Here is what I think.  

H6657   There used to be an OLD load problem like that.  Maybe
	930 has on old version of nodlod.

H6760	Perhaps a device has the same address as the DRV for 95.
	That would give some strange results.  The most likely thing
	is a loose cable to the DRV.  Less likely, but possible is
	a broken DRV.

H2346	The DUV to 6760 is not addressed correctly.

H10115	The link to 2346 may be down because you did the load over it
	and it may have a clean-up problem.

Subject: Job Queue - License bits 

We need to maintain some level of control over what entities (persons and
programs) can manipulate the job queue data.  We have at our disposal one
free bit in the privilege word, 3 free bits in the "real" license word and
(I think) 9 or 10 free bits of "pseudo" license.

I propose that we use one of the 3 bits in the license word to allow users
and programs to perform certain "privileged" queue functions, such as insert
delete and setting system-level priorities.  I also think that OP license
may be enough to allow operations to run some programs, but that operators
in general should not have this Queue-Manipulation (QM) license.  Instead a
pseudo license Queue-Administrator (QA) ought to be given them which would
require a TATTLE record to be written with their OPERNAME whenever they need
to change something and programs having QM license would check QA license
before they allow users/processes to do things.

**** Defacto **** Temporarily, in lieu of discussion, I've defined LC.QM as
1B11 (1B29 for frame) for this purpose.  Nothing {SETOP,OPER,MONITOR,etc.}
knows about it (yet), but it's there in the programs being written today.

Comments?  Aspersions?  Complaints?

JL license might be reasonable since one having JL license could write their
own PERP to do whatever they want.  One reason to have a new license for the
PERP replacement would be to be able to give it to people you didn't want to
give JL to.  However, since much of the power infered by JL is manifest in an
indirect manner in the queue file, manipulating it is tantamount to JL.  I
also doubt that you'd want to give this new license to anyone who doesn't
already have JL, anyway.  I suppose that manipulating the queue does not give
one indirectly or otherwise the ability to create frames logged in to any
arbitrary PPN as JL does -- in that sense it is considerably less powerful.
If the new PERP validates Usernames/PPN's in the queue file against the LUD
as I have assumed in my last statement, then this would be an argument for
making the new license, and considering it less powerful than JL.

I completely and emphatically agree that the license to directly manipulate
the queue, QM or JL or whatever, be held only by development/systems people.
The kind of access required by operations should be allowed through a program
which holds QM/JL and performs the limited and audited functions on behalf of
an operator validated by OP or some such license.  Being set on the frame may
be enough since the audit trail to the operator name does exist in the stream.

Well, that's the sum total of my babble on the subject.  How's it going?
Need a beta test site?  We have no PERP at all so a flakey one would be
welcome!  I'd even be willing to insert stuff in the queue by hand if
necessary until things solidify.

I'm not sure of the actual extent of the problem, but our group, the PDP-10
operating systems group, has spent some time pinpointing some problem areas
which need some work.  In particular, the node/base and host crashes caused
when the dispatcher gets sick for any reason.  We would like to at least
discuss our concerns before you release the new E-Bus base code to the rest
of the world.

If this is the schedule for an interim release while the remainder of our
concerns are worked into a later version of the code, that will be agreeable.
However, we would like to coordinate the release of the E-Bus code with our
own operating system releases scheduled for the PDP-10s in the next two
months.

Please reply, or give one of us a call.

   As it appears, your memo on patching systems is a slightly updated
version of the previous policy.  I'd like to point out that username
XCONSULT is not utilized as an effective message sending name.  If it
is utilized at all...

    Please... if we are to use ONTYME, send all messages to TXS.SUP for
any kind of resonable response.  If you'd like to go over your memo with
me, there are a couple of other things...  The old systems of updating
various maps have not been well understood and are in need of some new
tutorage as well as possible replacements.

Symptom:  System crashes attempting all-files with TITO.  Last user done
	  was (BETATESTINT).  Assumption was that a file in BETATESTINT
	  was bad.  Checked with Osman since similar problem occurred on
	  13-Apr-86, system 26.

Problem:  File 041486.SAT in (BILLING10) was bad.  File could be looked
	  at, but not read completely.  CKSUM and copy failed & crashed
	  the system.

	  Examined file with TSTSUP.  File has a hole in it an otherwise
	  appears to be normal.  These files should not have holes in them!
	  Apparently something is deleting a page without updating all the
	  proper file-system tables and thus a hole in this file seems to
	  be causing a crash.

Solution: The file was marked bad by hand using TSTSUP and this prevents
	  TITO from attempting to put it on tape.  The file was renamed to
	  (CRASH:26) for further examination.

Subject: INTADR stuff. 

The idea of expanding the 70-word INTADR block can be done, I have located all
the places that need to be changed to allow this.  Unfortunately, the following
interrupt causes can not take direct advantage of the extra room in the block:
	(4) Timer trap
	(6) WAKE uuo
	(13) Notice to quit
	(14) Exit in child frame
	(16) TRU limit exceeded
	(0-2,4-12)  All port initiated interrupts except for 3=no room for UUO
These interrupts are detected while not in the job's context and cannot access
user address space.

This is an argument for having a nonswappable process data block, which is
allocated when the frame is assigned, resides in exec virtual address space,
and is pointed to by a new JBT table.

See (M33)INTADR.MEM for details.

Joe,
  is it possible to return in our 35 word block, the "cause" of the interrupt
on a given channel, and not overwrite it when a second interrupt occurs on
the same channel, i.e. force the event to "block"?, so that if we have 2 or 3
causes assigned to the same channnel, we can distinguish the cause, and the
next cause will interrupt us again, etc...

  or does this just get us back to the "we only have one bit" scenerio... i
think it does, so this is again, all for naught... sigh.

Subject: Micronode can't talk to TYMNET. 

Our PDP-11 nodes are currently running with code from CURR11.  Does that code
correctly handle "host down"?  (At one time attempting to login to a down or
shut host caused the PDP-11 to get a fatal node error.)

From 930, I tried to build an aux circuit to host 90 in Paris.  TAUX build the
circuit, which was immediately zapped.  From that point on, I could not build
any circuit from 6657 to anywhere in TYMNET.  But new circuits could still
be build from TYMNET nodes to 930.  The outgoing connection to TYMNET remained
in this state until I disconnected the sync line between 6657 and 3146 for
60 seconds.  I tried "TAUX :90" three more thimes, with the same results.

Similar problems occured when I tried to "TAUX :90" from host 95.  It did
not get the circuit established, instead TAUX reported "monitor too slow,
timeout".  Again, the microbase, node 6760 was messed up and stayed that way
until I disconneced its sync line to 3146, waited 60 seconds, and reconnected
the line.  Then I could build a circuit to any host other than 90, 92, and 930.

While all this was going on, 10115 got a fatal node error BPA.  I don't know
if this had anything to do with the "host 9x" problem, but I had to reload
host 62.

Subject: LOGOUT loops forever if the UFD interlock is busy. 

LOGOUT gets the UFD interlock before cleaning up the directory (deleting TMP
files and such).  If the DSKB interlock is busy for 6 minutes, it jumps to
the label NXTSTR to do the next structure.  Unfortunately, NXTSTR has "DSKB"
hardcoded in, therefore it loops back trying DSKB again and again.

Dennis reported that there were 6 jobs logged in as WRPNET and all 6 were
in SL wait state, had been for some time, and had JACCT making them immune
to TAKEIT.  I located the call to LOKSTR in the listing and put a JFCL in
the error return in (SYS:28)LOGOUT.SHR.  5 minutes later one of the jobs
timed out, hit the JFCL, did its work, released the UFD interlock, and went
away.  Within a few seconds all the other jobs did likewise.

We should either patch LOGOUT on all systems or distribute a new release as
soon as possible.

Subject: Hopefully the last word. 

From: William R. Soley <WRS@C39.Tymnet>
  I think there is also a problem in the whole concenpt of the UFD interlock.
  If a process obtains the lock and dies without releasing it, it will be
  forever busy (as I recall).  This has happened to me a few times.  The
  symptom is the same, except that they never come out of sleep.  Someone
  should probably check this, hopefully its just my imagination.  -Bill

From: Carl A Baltrunas <Carl@X930.Tymnet>
    On some systems WRS has patched the interlock check to a JFCL... it happens
  a lot on very heavily loaded systems that somehow the interlock gets stuck
  and the all jobs get stuck trying to loginn or logout.
    I haven't "patched" it because i think the timeout wait is needed, but... it
  ought to fall out of the timeout loop after so many tries.   if you want to
  change the source to loop for a few tries, then fall out, fine by me...

From: Joe Smith
The above two messages appear to have a misconception.  The STRUUO to get the
UFD interlock never waits.  It returns success or failure immediately.  The
surrounding code has a counter that starts at ^D360 and has a SLEEP for 1
second.  This means that whenever the PUSHJ to LOKSTR gives the error return,
then the job has been waiting for 6 minutes already.  The real culprit is
whoever removed the code that checks the job's search list and put the
constant SIXBIT/DSKB/ in at NXTSTR.  That hack caused the infinite loop.

Symptom: 2020 hung, responds to nonzero in 30, was looping at channel 7.

The list of TTY chuncks it was trying to free had looped back upon itself.
STLST could not find the end, and had AOSed TTFREN several million times.

Subject: The P-10 monitor will not crash when TTYZNE occurs. 

I put P034/P-10 in NEWMON on all the Dallas machines.  This should eliminate
all the TTYZNE, WRTSAT, and BADSAT crashes.  (It won't eliminate the cause,
or the messages on the CTY, it just won't crash the system.)  I am on call
this weekend; you can get ahold of me through the beeper or answering system
if NEWMON gives you any trouble.     Joe Smith.

Differences between P034/P-8 and P034/P-10.

Patch #9, BIOZAP.PAT - Do not crash the base when a zap is received on a port
that is doing block-I/O and the PDP-10 hasn't had a chance to do any clean-up
yet.  This occurs sometimes when a circuit is zapped while running TELECOPY.

Patch #10, DIETYO.PAT - Fix INFO stopcodes so that TTYZNE, WRTSAT, and BADSAT
do not crash the system.  Instead, they output an appropriate message to the
CTY and the system continues.  Fix all other types of stopcodes to update the
key so that the base won't get unhappy and deposit nonzero in 30 until after
the crash dump is started.

P034/P-10 has been installed on the following systems:

Subject: Bug in F3 microcode. 

I was checking the instructions that DEC defined after the KI was built to see
if the F3 executed these new opcodes the same as the KL and KS.  I haven't gone
thru the entire list, because I was rudely halted in the double-integer codes.

DADD = opcode 114 = add pair of ACs to pair of memory locations and store the
		    71-bit integer result in the two ACs. 
This works on the F3.

DSUB = opcode 115 = subtract pair of memory locations from pair of ACs and
		    store the 71-bit integer result in the two ACs.
This works on F3.

DMUL = opcode 116 = multiply pair of memory locations by pair of ACs and store
		    the quad-word result in four ACs.
Unimplemented on F3 - traps to INSSIM which goes to ILLINS.

DDIV = opcode 117 = divide quad-word number in four ACs by pair of memory
		    locations.  Put quotient in two ACs, reminder in two ACs.
This halts the F3 microcode.

The F3 is halted very dead by opcode 117.  The MI STOP light was on, as were
MI PAR ERROR and MEM PAR ERROR.  (I have hardcopy showing which lights were on
and what instruction I used.)

Since I was not sure that the microcode could be successfully restarted, so
I reloaded the microcode and reloaded 930.  I am sure the same would happen
on 62, where an unprivileged user running DDT can halt the system.

Whenever I try to build an AUX circuit from 930 to host 90 in Paris, TAUX
reports "[network passthru created]" and then two seconds later "[network
passthru deleted]".  At this point, all TYMNET circu;thru 6657 get zapped.
New circuits can come in from TYMNET, but for the next 5 minutes 6657 can
not build circuits out.  It does clear up in about 5 minutes.

This particular problem has been plaguing 930 for at least 6 months.
I don't think it has anything to do with the problem where aux circuits
that originate from 930 lose characters.

I came in Saturday and found the second F3 halted.  MEM PAR ERROR was on,
MI STOP was on, but MI PAR ERROR was off (this is different from the DDIV
halt).  I could not even start to reload the microcode in 62 because its
tape drive has vacuum problems - it won't load the tape.  62 is sitting in
the same state I found it, the lights still show the microcode status at the
time of the halt

Subject: Node 6760 

Joe, 
  The problem you had with 6760 could be a loading problem.  The bootstrap
promes in 6760 may not handle the longer possible timeout of loadii.  The
sucessful running of the (CURR11) version doesn't mean that the load
of the (NEW11)version went correctly.  Try it again.  If the same thing happens,
halt 6760.  If the halt address (typed out with a @) is around 1246 or 157700,
then 6760 is still in the bootstrap.  It would have timed out at the very end
of the load.  Try the load again.  If you want to eliminate timeouts, turn
of the "LTC" switch before depressing restart. (on some of your boxes LTC is
labeled "AUX").  Don't forget to turn it back on after loading is complete,
because the micronode doesn't run very well without an accurate clock.

You were right about the LTC.  When it's on, the PDP-11 does not successfully
load, ODT shows the PC as 001270.  When it's off, both NEW11 and CURR11 load.
But I still have problems (NEW11)ND6760.BND - it won't talk to 95 and it won't
talk to TYMNET even though it says the link is up.

Since FREE only guarentees 10 free jobs, unless alot of them are detached,
it isn't going to help them any on 25 until they get a new monitor (which
they probably should, anyway).

No. ISG-86-040                                     April 2, 1986



To:      ISG LISTS LEVEL A-E

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible
         for informing their clients of significant service
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer"
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls
         regarding network or operational problems will be
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and
         manuals which describe the use of processing services.

    o    Maintenance of mailing lists of commercial clients.


    o    Publishing of MDIPC Service Descriptions.

    o    Vendor manual's purchasing and distribution, e.g. IBM,
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number
         is available for batch job status inquiries and priority
         asssitance.

    o    1-800-MDC-HELP (1-800-632-4357) or 1-314-232-6943, in
         Missouri are numbers that may be called when you do not
         know who to call.  You will be connected with an
         appropriate MDIPC area to resolve any processing
         problems.

    Any changes in contact points for MDIPC services will be
    coordinated in advance with the appropriate ISG Business
    Units.

Jerry McCoy and Ray Donahue found and fixed two hardware problems with the 
Army's KI - one module in the pager and one in the disk controller.  Bart
Wheeler, Ed Kochanowski, and I added patches to PULSAR up thru autopatch tape
7.  This is expected to lessen their problems with the weekly backup hanging
between reel changes.  The Army and PRC seemed pleased with the results.

Subject: C26 crashes. 

Operations tell me that the first crash occurred when they took the ALL FILES
tapes that were written on C70 and mounted them on C26 in order to get a listing
(C70 is bogged down compared to C26).  The other two crashes (at FILAUS, alias
DECUMC+10) occurred when TITO was running "STORE (BILLING10)*.SAT".
It takes 1 hour 15 minutes to do a full DSKCLN on C26. 

I plan to use (CARL)DIRECT with /W/F to get the file names, then run TSTSUP
on each, looking for holes.

3 crashes in the last shift.  1 with no indication, 2 with stopcode FILAUS.
(FILAUS is in FILFND at DECUMC+10)  Checked JOB and $Q+JBTPRG in all crashes.
If the job was running TITO, then the file name and extension can be found in
.CPCAC+15 and .CPCAC+16 (contents of ACs 15 and 16 in AC block 0 on the KL).
Found references to the following files in (BILLING10): 052786.SAT, 052086.SAT,
050286.SAT.  All three files now have the NFS bit set so TITO will not touch
them.

Subject: System 62 status 

System 62 was out of commission due to some scribbling on the disk.

I rewrote APA0's 1st & 2nd HOM pages, copying them from APA1 and
making the appropriate changes.  Then, I re-created a rib page for
(SYS)SAT.SYS and brought the system up to TITO directories (HELGEM)
and (CARL).  The system went through a FULL DKSCLN without any
apparent problems...  If anyone lost files (other than Bill or myself)
I can only offer my sympathy.

Files I created late friday night appeared to be intact, so I doubt
anyone else lost anything.

Dennis Ernst is looking into the micronode problems... please record
any fatal node error messages, and if "1000G" works, or if the node
doesn't crash, please login as "XRAY:ST@" from the node's CTY and do
a "C" command.  Record the number "V=255,2" (for example) with the
fatal error.  At the moment, version 255,2 is the proper new version.

Problem:  Two recent crashes @19:11 CRA016 and @21:44 CRA017 showing a
          STOPCD APRFAT, NoMemory MemBusParity... but in CRA017 registers
          at .CPCAC+15,16 contained ONTR03.R00, from directory BETATEST.
          A CHKSUM of the file resulted in a crash.  Told OPS to send mail
          to the user and to have maintenance check out the APRFAT/CPU
          angle with a quick once-over.  File renamed to directory CRASH
          setting NFD.

Solution: Not really solved.. this problem has been cropping up more and

Subject: Access Date bug 

It appears impossible to create, supercede, update or rename a file such
that it has any access date other than the one it had, or todays.  This
is a bug.  The YAMM says you can always set it to a date in the past.  I
want to create files with ancient creation dates so I can tell when they've
been accessed.  -Bill

Subject: Access date vs Creation date 

It appears you've got your wires crossed, (or your eyes).  Creation dates
CAN be set to the past without any problems.  Access dates say create and
supersede must be 0 or in the future; update and rename are not clear as
to how they work with non-zero dates... and I thought that that worked if
rename is used.  If it doesn't then, I don't know that it should allow a
person to set access dates to the past.. since the rename is an access and
should update the access date to the present!

/Carl

Ancient creation dates work fine... I guess update & rename only allow the
original or the present access date, so ancient access dates are illegal.
I understand what you want to do, so I sympathize.

Subject: RMURPHY and GAN 3 

My understanding is that RMURPHY is working on the TUMS project... but
I don't know who he is or why he should have a GAN 3 username.  Another
GAN should be setup for this project or he should have a GAN from NTD,
not TYMCOM-X.  I realise that someone just did a GAN change on that user
but GAN 3 should NOT have been used.  Please rectify this, or have Ken
Jones (or whomever is running the show contact me).

Ooops, I did say "creation" when I meant "access" in my last sentence.
At any rate, the YAMM says that Create/Supercede can set only current or
future (but why?) and update/Rename can set only current or past.  One
would have to close with option '10 to preserve a date in the past.  At
any rate, I can't set anything but what it was or current using any
combination of lookup/enter/rename.  TITO would want to set it to the
past, as well as other archive like programs.  I am sure it used to
work, but it probably got broken when Ernie added the fast disk clean
stuff.  -Bill

Well, I don't know what's going on with RMURPHY.  I certainly didn't suggest
he be in GAN 3 or even know he was changing GAN for that matter.  In fact I
suggested he not do anything regarding validations and I was just going to
MOVUSR him to the systems he needed (with fixup).  At any rate, they don't
seem to be able to decide what to do:
  11/11/83 originally validate in GAN 11334

Subject: System 62 - Events 

During an attempt to do the all-files on 62, we kept losing vacuum on
the tape drive.  Steve Capik was called but has not yet arrived to date.

Last night, we decided to try the Kennedy 9400 drive that Dan & Eric
had sitting on the cart to see if it really was compatible and whether
the F3 could handle it.  Apparently, under timesharing, the 9400 works
just fine at 1600 or 6250 bpi.

Due to lack of an available working 9100 drive, we decided to see how much
tape an all-files took at 6250 and started the all-files.  It completed
this afternoon, and with the exception of one tape (accidently) written at
1600 bpi, the save took 6.5 tapes.  (5.5 @ 6250, 1 @ 1600).

I believe that the all-files takes less time as well, but we didn't really
perform any accurate timing tests.

PS... it would be nice to be able to use a 9400 on one of our systems for

Subject: Weirdies on system 62 

Joe,
    System 62 has some really weird problems with job #3, #5 and #7.  It
is possible that I can replicate the problem even further, but it tears
the system apart with "?error in detached job..." messages to the CTY
and OPR terminals, eating up to 60% of the CPU.  The IRONY is that SYSTAT
doesn't show anything.

  I was about to logoff and ran SY to see things at a glance, and WHOA..
there are 3 jobs, detached, running logout in ^C state.  So I try killing
them first with LOGOUT, then DDT and the HANG uuo, then TAKEIT... no dice
so I go to reload the system...  OOPS!

  Takeit sets the current terminal to OPR, and >Zap< >Zing< >Zowie< there
comes a flood of "?error in detached job..." messages all over the place.
Tons and tons of them... I finally got out of TAKEIT and zapped the OPR
port.  I then attached to the 3 jobs one at a time, couldn't run anything
at all (seems like no context pages? or something?) ...anyway, CORE 0 did
work, and by attaching, the "?error..." messages stopped going to the CTY
and OPR terminals.

  Jobs are still there, detached... I wanted to make sure we could get a
good crash somehow before we reload it.  Even if it means patching a good
copy of BOOTS into the monitor!!!

Wayne, as you requested, I've deleted oper name MPL for Paula Leahy.
She was in a tree that was chock full of terminated employees so I
deleted them all.  I don't know what the relationship was, am a bit

its possible that's not her real oper name, or it could be coincidence.
Anyway, deleted are:

	DHSMITH
	HINCKLEY
	MCH
These are only deleted from 34 and 39 and associated slaves.  The

Due to lack of an available working 9100 drive, we decided to see how much
tape an all-files took at 6250 and started the all-files.  It completed
this afternoon, and with the exception of one tape (accidently) written at
1600 bpi, the save took 6.5 tapes.  (5.5 @ 6250, 1 @ 1600).

I believe that the all-files takes less time as well, but we didn't really
perform any accurate timing tests.

/Carl

PS... it would be nice to be able to use a 9400 on one of our systems for
      all of the backups.....

Subject: Weirdies on system 62 

Joe,
    System 62 has some really weird problems with job #3, #5 and #7.  It
is possible that I can replicate the problem even further, but it tears
the system apart with "?error in detached job..." messages to the CTY
and OPR terminals, eating up to 60% of the CPU.  The IRONY is that SYSTAT
doesn't show anything.

  I was about to logoff and ran SY to see things at a glance, and WHOA..
there are 3 jobs, detached, running logout in ^C state.  So I try killing
them first with LOGOUT, then DDT and the HANG uuo, then TAKEIT... no dice
so I go to reload the system...  OOPS!

  Takeit sets the current terminal to OPR, and >Zap< >Zing< >Zowie< there
comes a flood of "?error in detached job..." messages all over the place.
Tons and tons of them... I finally got out of TAKEIT and zapped the OPR
port.  I then attached to the 3 jobs one at a time, couldn't run anything
at all (seems like no context pages? or something?) ...anyway, CORE 0 did
work, and by attaching, the "?error..." messages stopped going to the CTY
and OPR terminals.

  Jobs are still there, detached... I wanted to make sure we could get a
good crash somehow before we reload it.  Even if it means patching a good
copy of BOOTS into the monitor!!!

Subject: New CALLI -151 : FINASS 

We've implemented a new uuo, Frame INteruppt ASSignment to allow one to
assign an interrupt cause to another frame.  Primary usage will be to
trap EXIT/LOGOUT in child frame on a frame by frame basis (instead of
.IAFEX, exit in any child).  We will later have .FOCSI : cause software
interrupt in frame with causes .IASIP (software interrupt from parent),
.IASIC (child), .IASIS (sibling), .IASIA (any frame)...

Anyway, I'd like to use this stuff in SAIL and at the moment I don't want
to have to release a new version of SAIL... (at least not yet)...

Do you know if there are *ANY* sail programs using INTDEV(DEV,CAUSE,CHAN)
which executes the INTRMT uuo to assign the interrupt channel.

Documentation says that this is only good for the ACT: device and I suspect
that only CHKPNT.MAC uses this uuo.  Does that sound realistic?  ...or are
there old programs lying around (in sail, or other languages) to attempt to
use the INTRMT uuo?

Do you know of any SAIL programs using INTRMT directly?

--------------

On system 62 in the meantime, I've "patched" SAIL.LOW and SAISGA.SHR to
use "FINASS 1," (calli -151) in the one place that had "INTRMT 1," (calli -52)
in the code.

I will propagate this change throughout the world if you can't come up
with any objections...

Subject: 2020 Progress (Cough) 

Some progress has been made in getting the 2020 up and running...
however, not enough...

1) By swapping the RH11's we can boot from magtape on UBA1/RH=776700
2) We have a KS1LOD.DMP file which uses UBA1 and the first RH.
3) We can load in the monitor.

after swapping the RH11s back to their original positions, we can start
to bring the system up... however, we get a PAGEME (using KSXN13) or an IME
stopcode.  IME in FILIO @ ERRRCV+12/LDB T2,PGYPNO  just after LDB PG,UNYPAC.
THis is the normal case.  If I load DDT and try to single step, or put in a
breakpoint at ERRRCV+anything it prints $n>> and then falls into the infinate
loop printing the "Manual restart from 147" message without printing any of
the stopcode info.

  All of this happens just when I try to enter FILES... I haven't gotten far
enough to even try to refresh the disks.

  The above error got me thinking maybe one of the drives/packs has a problem
so I moved the plugs around and tried a single pack (the one that had gotten
the home page inconsistancy errors) and the stopcode PCBIO(FINPCB+13) started
occurring.  At this point, I'm stopping for the evening.

Joe: If you have any ideas... let me know via MAIL, or call in the afternoon.

  And another thing... we only have 448K of memory (7 of 8 boards) in the
machine... are we missing one? is it out for repair? does anyone know?

Craig: Any help we can get on getting the other RH11 fixed, or the memory
       checked out... I doubt these stopcodes are all software problems...
       also that first drive, write-locked lamp...

Re: Our micronet...

Well... there has been a proposal to put our hosts and the bases for them
(which is a major portion of our micronet) in another building about 1.5
miles north of South Bay Center.  TYMNET plans to build a computer room to
house many engines and we may rent floor space from them for our machines.
A decision about this is supposed to be made on Monday.  It will save FSC
money by not having to build a computer room, and just having to rent the
floor space in a TYMNET facility (at a lower rate than at South Bay Center),
and it would save TYMNET some money since we would be renting the space in
their building.

What is not being considered is what it would cost for modems, leased lines
and the people time and expense to travel that 1.5 miles every time we need
to do anything with our machines.  (It may be being considered, but it does
not appear in the "bottom line" figures like building a room does).

If you know what the going rate for 9600 baud modems is, please send mail to
Craig (and me) so we can find out what this will cost us...  same for leased
lines from PAC-TEL.

We can still run a line (preferably 2) from our nodes at this new site to one
or two LSI-11s (we just happen to have 1 good extra 11/03-SE,BA11-ME set, a
dubious 11/03-SE,BA11-ME set and an 11/03-LJ (old 2346) which could be setup
with DZV-11s and give us our hard-wired lines as well as our LN03 connection.
It means 1 or 2 lines at 9600 will knock us down in data speed, especially if
we only have one line and we do any printing. I'll show you the alternatives
we have when I see you on Monday.

Subject: Incidental location costs 

Craig,
  Dennis Ernst tells me we can not expect to run our DUV-11 or DUP-11 line
at speeds greater than 9600.  The devices will do 19.2, but the software and
the LSI-11 cannot handle the interrupts at those speeds... in fact they are
often having data over-runs at 9600 due to the single interrupt capability
in the 11/03.

  If we assume we are to house our machines 1.5 miles away from our normal
workplace with no actual operational support, is anyone taking into account
the reduced productivity caused by having to drive that 3 miles, parking 2
times (assuming that the light rail does not extend that far?), or the cost
of having to drive or take public transportation just to reload our hosts
or the micro-bases?

  Or... the fact that we would more or less be unable to car pool on any
given day, (since we might need our own auto at any time to drive over to
our lab machines?)

  I realize that these qustions might seem picky, not to mention the extra
expense of communications, maybe forcing us to use more TYMNET resources on
the public net...  we might not actually save anything in the long run by
moving our machines to another site...  >>KICK<< >>TUMBLE<<  [soapbox just
forcibly removed from beneath my feet].

  Anyway, I think I've voiced what concerns that have come to haunt me.

Subject: Micronet and Host numbers 

I've talked to validations and tehy see no reason why we cannot use some of
the two-digit host numbers for our hosts.  I still need to check with Ed Roop
about using some of the old 940 host numbers (although Jan said we could use
36 after this weekend, and 57 at the end of May) such as 10 thru 21. If so,
we can then re-use 118, 930 and 934 for DZ-11 and DZV-11 devices on our net
so that we can build circuits to them from TYMNET.

More later... probably by meeting time on Wednesday.

Subject: Takeit %50 

I modified TAKEIT to continue even though it cannot access DSK or create
a LOG file.  (IF it can, it will.  If not, C'est la vie).

I also added code to set and clear KSYS.

Except for one small detail of the HOLD command (TAKEIT keeps an internal
counter and holds it steady, while the monitor KSYS counter doesn't have
the capability to "hold" at a specific value) which needs to be discussed
and implemented based on that discussion, TAKEIT %50 is ready for testing.

One possibility is for TAKEIT to reset the KSYS word in the monitor each
minute.  I put in the hooks and code for that, but it isn't quite turned
on (Need to move it to another location).

Another is that we set the sign bit, (only allowing 17 bits for the value)
and the sign-extended 18th bit says HOLD the current value.  (Since we do
not allow the monitor to go negative... true? [I didn't check]).

We can also change the SETUUO to use ac/ fn,addr   addr/ bits,,time
   or even better                    ac/ bits+fn,,time
   or add another setuuo or two... HOLD KSYS, CONTINUE KSYS

Subject: Cause of GTSAP1 stopcode in /A02, /A05, and /B03. 

There were two changes to SWAMP involved.  1) A DSKOFF instruction was moved to
avoid possible race conditions, and 2) better load balancing by putting new 
files on the unit with most space. 

The real problem was when the DSKOFF instruction was moved and the nearby
"JRST .-3" was not noticed.  The fix was to put a label at the right place and
jump to it.  The bug did not cause problems on a lightly loaded system, the
GTSAP1 crash occurred only when SAT I/O was in progress at the instant that
a new job tried to log in.

The second change caused SAT I/O to occur when new files were being created.
It forced the RIB of the new file to be created on the unit with the most
space instead of the SAT that happened to be in core.

Now that both changes are in and working properly, the monitor allocates disk
space better.  This should cause a noticable performance improvement when
DSKB is rebuilt from TITO all-files.   /Joe

Subject: Inactivity timeout bug fixed. 

There is a bug in the job inactivity timeout killer that has been fixed.
The bug has existed for some time, and caused F29 to crash 3 times this
weekend.  The noname stopcode at TTYFND+2(SCNSER+13721) was triggered when
the inactivity timeout monitor noticed a job logged in as MAIL running TMS
that had been idle for more than 15 minutes.  In the process of killing it,
accumulator J got set to 777454, which is not in the JBT tables.  The was
not noticed on F29 before because (MAIL)TMS was not running on that system
until this weekend.  (Bill said he was moving the major MAIL functions from
system 39 to system 29.)  This may also explain some of B39's crashes.

The fix is in (M33)INTKIL.PAT on all systems, and has been applied to
(SYS:29)SYSTEM.SAV=F29-P035/B03-3 and (SYS:29)NEWMON.SAV=F29-P035/B04-3.

I doubt the inactivity timer bug is responsible for any crashes on 39
since it was never used (to my knowledge).  In fact it should not be
expiring on 29, so I have to go check why it was being inactive for so
long.  -Bill

Subject: Preventing XEXEC from running after DSKCLN during system rebuild. 

As an interim solution, I have modified INITIA to not start the XEXEC job
if the file (XEXEC)INITIA.SYS does not exist.  Instead, it will output
"?INITIA cannot run XEXEC until (XEXEC)INITIA.SYS is restored from tape."
every 5 minutes until the file is created or until the OPER kills the
job.  Until Carl finishes SUBOPR, this will ensure that XEXEC does not
start after the full DSKCLN that is necessary between restoring SYS and
the rest of the structure.

If (XEXEC)INITIA.SYS is accidently deleted, just create a new one.  It
doesn't matter what's in the file as long as it exists.

Joe,
  Your solution may be a kludge, but it's elegant!  It could probably even be
beyond the class of kludge if it were not a temporary measure.   (I know, an
"elegant kludge" is an oxymoron.  But among kludges, yours is truly elegant.)

          CHKPNT was stuck with JACCT on (it was waiting for the SETUUO to
          finish typing on the CTY which was not responding).
Solution: Logged in, tried to set license to use MDDT, but got stuck in ML
          because CHKPNT was stuck.  Told them to get FSC to try to clear the
          PDP11 that KLDCP could deposit nonzero in 30.  Else power off KL.

I haven't looked, but i expect line length (terminator) to be a problem.

Subject: Host numbers less than 256. 

The KI and KL based PDP10 systems can only use host numbers in the range for
1 to 255.  This is because there is a one-byte field used by the PDP10 to tell
its base what host number it wants to use.  This information is passed on to
the supervisor when the PDP10 comes up - it is not set by the base node's
TYM file.  Since any PDP10 can pretend to be any host in this range, it would
help us if we were to have a list of the status of all host numbers from 1 to
255 inclusive.

At one time, Field Service Company was using host numbers 107 and 108 when
bringing up a system in test mode.  Now it appears that those host numbers
are treated special by the Supervisor.  Therefore we would like to know which
host numbers it is safe to use.

The folks from Bldg.  C, including the Resource Planning & Management unit and

they have new phone numbers.

On top of this, the tie line between here and Solar Way has been taken out.
Because of this, you have to get out of the old Tymshare telephone network
into the public phone network, then dial the exchange and the whole 4-digit
extension number to reach anyone over there.  This is also true of the PDP-10
operators, and Lenny.


the numbers are:

It uses the same routine that is now part of "TYPE BAT" in the FILES dialog.
If you run (MPL)TYPBAT on 930, the F3 is having problems with record 0 on
head 0 of many cylinders.  If you run it on any of the other systems, you
will see that the 3652 disks have not bad spots, the 3675 disks have a log
of bat spots, and they are all on record 14 of an odd head.  The pattern is
so strong, it looks like BPXKON is having problems.      /Joe

Subject: /B04 is expected to have several "%% EVENT stopcode BADPAG" messages. 

Running /B02 or later once will activate the badblock recording routines.
/B04 will output a message on the CTY when a badblock is detected, all
previous monitors noticed the badblock but never said anything.

This means that system that starts running /B04 on the old disks is expected
to get sporadic BATPAG messages until the first time an ASP is done.  During
the ASP, flurry of up to 20 BADPAG messages would not be unusual.  After the
ASP completes, the number of new BADPAG messages should slow to less than
one a week.  Operations can run (MPL)TYPBAT to see how bad the disks are.

The point I'm trying to make is that the sudden flare-up of BADPAG messages
is not the fault of the new monitor.  The disks are getting read errors and
a deficiency in the previous monitors caused problems to not be reported.

Help!  System 57 went away.  Right now we have absolutely no way to reload

We can't use NODLOD from 95 because routing from 6760 to 2346 is not working.
We can't use LOADII from 57 now that it's gone.  We can't use LOADII from 39
because of passwords thru the gateway.  We would like to use LOADII from 95
but it is not authorized to do so.

Could you go through channels and get LOADII working for us on system 95?
And as a backup, get NEW11 validated on F26 and D31 (since our micronet is
sort of a private net)?

Subject: Possible explanation for the multitude of BADPAG occurances. 

We have observed two kinds of bad spots on the disk.  A real one is consistantly
bad - you couldn't read it last week and you can't read it this week.  All the
bad spots on 930 (62's disk) are real.  A phantom bad spot causes a read error
once - copying the file to itself clears up the read error.  Almost all of the
read errors on the IBM disks are phantom.

It looks now as if there is (and always has been) a bug in BPXKON.  Whenever the
monitor decides to read in a bunch of pages on the same cylinder, it calls
BPXKON repeatedly until BPXADD says it can't handle any more.  If the pages are
contiguous on disk and contiguous in core, BPXADD is given a request that could
very easily exceed the size of the command list.  When this occurs, BPXADD is
committed to do the transfer, so it has to split it up and do the second part
after getting an interrupt from the first part done.  When a request spans the
track boundry, BPXKON has to create a new select-head command before it
continues building read commands.  I do not like the code that handles end-of-
track and changed that section in CPXKON.

My reason for suspecting BPXKON is that for all but 2 of the read errors, it
was for records 15-18 of an even track.  If BPXADD did not recognize the end
of the track, it would attempt to read records 19-22 of the current track
instead of 1-3 of the next track.  Of all the ERRCHK reports I looked at, they
all said "Search error, Count error, Record 18".

If BPXKON did have this failure in the past, a read error would occur when the
read request filled up the command list and overflowed onto the next track at
the same time.  This scenario is a virtual certainty when running ASP.  ASP
would get 30 errors per disk, not report them (because it turned off error
checking on read), and CORE1 would attempt to log them in the BAT pages when
the pages were released.  Since the BAT self-pointers were not initialized,
nothing would get into the BAT pages.  The only trace left that a read error
had occured is that the "M" bit would be set so the page would not be 
recycled.  This would last only until the next DSKCLN, at which there would
be no log of the phantom read error.

P035/B04 had two changes.  One is that the read errors get logged to the CTY
as BADPAG stopcodes and logged in the BAT pages.  The second is that MAPIO
now makes new files be allocated to contiguous pages on disk when it is
convenient to do so.  This second change makes disk I/O more efficient.  It
also increases the probability that programs other than ASP will cause the
channel command list to get filled up and trigger the BPXKON bug.  CPXKON does
not exhibit this bug.

Therefore I suggest we go forward with /B04 on all 3650/3652 systems.
Until BPXKON is fixed (or CPXKON verified as reliable with 3675 blocks),
the 3675 disk systems should NOT run /B04 (or /B05).

To verify some of the things I've said, we need to run ASH on all systems.
If it is BPXKON, then unreported read errors would cause ASP to write bad
data to tape.  If system 39 is any indication, then the bug means that 30
out of 68680 pages per unit were written bad.

Sometime back we decided to have the HELP command run (SYS)HELP instead of

It now responds to "HELP" to give general info, "HELP *" to give a list of

we should mention it in (SYS)ACCESS.MSG.   /Joe

Subject: Status of 32XB03 and 32XB06. 

I spent this afternoon at Building-C trying to find out why 29XB03 worked but
32XB06 didn't.  TELECOPY would not work with 32XB03 either, until I made
32's CONFIG file look like 29's.  The only significant difference was
"XP JOBS,^D64" versus "XP JOBS,^D80".  I tried adjusting JOBS.  TELECO does
not work with JOBS set to 64, 72, 76, 77.  It does work with 78, 80, 108, 127.
I don't know why.  32XB06 works now that I set JOBS to 127 and added the
following to COMMON:
  IFCPU(<KI,KL>),<IFL JOBN-^D78,<
  PRINTX ? TELECOPY won't run with JOBS less than 78>>

The crash dump has no indications as to why the system hung.  It is a good
dump, just no clues in it.  The only suggestion I have is that if it happens
again, type the control character to get to the KS10 prompt, then enter
"EM 30" and "DM 1".  That will get the crash code to save more information.
If that does not work, then do "BT" and "/D" as before.   /Joe

Subject: Hack to BPXKON installed on 58. 

The unit data block has enough room in the command list to handle 18 blocks
(1 track).  If a request for several contiguous blocks starts in the middle
of the track, then it will hit the end of the track before it hits the end
of the command list.  A portion of the spaghetti code near TRNCNT is supposed
to handle this, switch to the next head, and continue adding until the
command list is full.  That is one of the places I was uncomfortable with.
By putting a JFCL at TRNCNT+3, BPXADD won't do any fancy footwork to fake out
FILIO.  It will simply take the non-skip return, which tells FILIO to not add
anything more until the transfer-done interrupt comes in for the current
request.  Then FILIO will resume with the next block (which need not be on
a page boundry).

I logged in to 58 to test this, and found it SHUT due to all the "hard" errors.
Without the patch, ASH got several errors within the first 7000 pages.  With
the patch installed, it got no errors.   I zeroed out the BAT blocks so we
and the CTY can see new entries.  /Joe

Subject: Found BPXKON bug for /B06. 

If the command list is big enough to hold 25 blocks, then there were cases
where BPXKON would transfer the last 2 blocks on one track, and then try to
transfer 23 blocks on the next track.  That does not work - 3675's have only
18 blocks.  BPXKON assumed that the command list was a certain size, and
never checked it.  The following is now in /B06 for systems with 3675 disks.

Subject: F38 recovering from bad 3650 disk. 

System 38 had the HDA on BPA3 go bad.  PAKCPX had problems copying out the
pack due to "equipment check" on head 21 record 20 on 344 of the 555 cylinders.
I hacked at PAKCPX to get it to continue after such errors.  Rick Daniels read
the numbers to me over the phone, I wrote a quick program to create a DDT file,
and used TSTSUP on system 38 to create (JMS)BADPAG.MUP which had pointers to
all those pages in its RIB.  This caused DSKCLN to report the names of all the
files that were using those pages.  (JMS)FIX38.* shows what happened.  The end
result is FIX38.FIL (which was copied to (OPER:38)FIX38.FIL) which lists 274
files and 3 UFDs being damaged.  Restoring these files will be a lot quicker
than redoing the rebuild.  Time-in=02:18, time-out=12:31.   /Joe

Subject: System 38 will bring up P035/B07 tonight. 

I looked at the tracks left in the circular buffer and found a cause of
THUNGs.  There were several outstanding read requests, including one for unit
324.  When a request for 314 was added, for some reason it got a busy signal.
This is normal, the unit will be restarted when the not-busy signal comes in.
When the transfer on unit 324 finished, the not-busy signal came in as if it
were for units 320-327 instead of for units 300-317 as was expected.  Therefore
CPXKON tried to restart waiting units on BPB (unit 324 is BPB4), but not the
units on BPA (unit 314 is BPA14).  The THUNG was because unit 314 was not
restarted within 3 seconds.  Until we teach COMMOD and CPXKON that a single
controller (BPA) can have more than 16 disks, I put in a one-line hack that
restarts all waiting units when the not-busy signal comes in.  It will now find
any waiting unit, be it on BPA, BPB, BPC, or BPD.

Subject: Why /B07. 

Craig and Dennis:
  The previous message did not mention that the decision to create 38XB07
was made by Osman, Carl and myself.  The change is one line to CPXKON, but
is necessary to solve the THUNG problem on 38 and 3652 systems.  We also
decided that all systems currently running /B06 should come up on /B07 as
soon as possible.  The systems we scheduled to run /B06 next week will be
running /B07 at that time.

The correct fix (which will be after P035/C) will be to teach COMMOD and
CPXKON that there can be more than 2 strings on a controller.  The places
that currently store 16 flag bits in a halfword need to be modified to
handle 64 bits in two words.  Then update the CONFIG files so that systems
with many strings on a single physical controller show up as a single
logical controller.  In particular, system 38 will have BPA0-BPA27 instead
of BPA0-BPA17 + BPB0-BPB7, and systems with 3652s will have BPA0-BPA7 +
BPA40-BPA47 instead of BPA0-BPA7 + BPC0-BPC7.

The above change will make CPXKON aware of reality.  When it determines that
controller "BPA" is busy, it will correctly understand that the units on all
4 strings on that controller are busy.  Prior to /B07, CPXKON figured that
because the second 2 strings were assigned to "BPB", that it was a seperate
piece of hardware, and was not affected by "BPA" being busy.

I expect 38XB07 will not get any THUNGS.    /Joe

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


TYMCOM-10 Software Support will at times send mail to Operations
with instructions to bring a system up on a different monitor
and when it should be done.

Normally it is done during regular scheduled downtime.  The exceptions
to this rule are:

     a.  If a system is continuously going down; or

     b.  If USERS' are having problems with their software; or,

     c.  Problems of an EMERGENCY nature.

In these cases, they may request the system be recycled immediately
after they have solved the problem.  The crash code to use during
this recycle is the same crash code that was used when the problem
first developed.

Whatever shift this occurs on, the Operator should contact their Shift
Supervisor, or Senior Operator.  Please contact me if you cannot contact
the Shift Supervisor, or Senior Operator.
                                                                Page  2


The Shift Supervisor, or Senior Operator, should insure that the system
logbook has complete information entered into it.  They should also 
insure that:

     a.  SSW #4 is set

     b.  A note put on the CTY as to what monitor to bring system
         up on when recycled again or if the system should go down.

     c.  A monitor tape made for the host to use for COLDSTARTS.

     d.  Run DSKMAP to see if it has been updated.

     e.  Run R CRSHID;/SYS on the host to check monitor versions
         installed.

     f.  If there is a difference, then run RU (QASYS)MAPUPD.
         This program will update the DSKMAP.

     g.  When completed, run DSKMAP again and post it on the
         mainframe.

Please contact me if you have questions.

Thanks;

SUBJECT>   Testing ASP (Version 7)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The weekend of 18 July this software will be tested on system 58.
Between now and then, 14 disk packs need to be set up to be used.

For the next few weekends, I will schedule this system down at 2400
on Friday nights until 0800, Saturday mornings.  The regular ASP dump
will be rescheduled for this timeframe.  The remaining time after the
dump is to be used to REFRESH, FORMAT, and INITIALIZE the packs.

On the weekend of 27 June, 7 packs will be done, or as many as possible,
and 7 packs the weekend of 4 July.  If the weekend of 11 July is needed to
finish up, it will be scheduled.  These packs will be identified and set
aside for use on 18 July.

On 18 July, the system will be scheduled down from 2400, Friday night
with a scheduled uptime of 2400, 19 July.

                                                                Page  2

During this time an ASP dump will be taken on F58 using (OSU)ASP.SAV
(Version 7) software.  After tapes have been verified, the system packs
will be taken off-line and put aside.

The packs that were set up previously will be put on-line.

After the file structure has been built, the ASP tapes will be restored.
After the restore, the system will be UNSHUT for users.

Any problems, a backup will be taken (if possible), and the packs will
be switched.

Please see me if questions.

This is a follow-up on my ONTYME A73074.

Sequence of events leading up to the ASP test on 18 July and responsi-
bilities:

22 JUN     DAYS

Obtain 14 good disk packs and make up slap-tags.  Slap-tags will be
identified as follows:

     a.  Pack ID

     b.  Vender and serial number of pack.

     c.  NEW (ASP VER 7)

                                                                Page  2

When completed, packs will be stacked in the vicinity of F58 disks
drive and identified why they are there.  A list of pack serial
numbers will be provided the COORDINATOR.

26 JUN     SWINGS

Locate the 14 disk packs above and put in front of disk drives as
identified on slap-tags.

27 JUN     MIDS

Start ASP using (OSU)ASP, Version 7 on current running disk packs.

I will be in before ASP dump is completed to assist in pack movement.

Please contact me if any questions.

Subject: Created /B08 instead of /B07-1. 

As per discussion (with JMS, CARL, OSMAN, DENCOFF present), the fix system
38's FTACFC crash will not be distributed as a DDT patch.  Instead, /B08
will replace all copies of nnXB07.SAV.

The crash on F38 showed FTA3 was given a command, FTA1 interrupted while
waiting for FTA3 to finish so FTA1 was given a new command, then the unit
check on FTA3 was noticed.  Due to what appears to be a minor glitch in the
SA10 microcode, the pointer stored at memory location 300+2 implied FTA1
when the unit-check was reported for FTA3 at location 300+1.  This
inconsistancy caused the FTACFC stopcode, which is the same as KAF with
CH1's PC indicating a loop at PI channel 3 at SGPREV in FTASER.  The patch
is to set T4 to a reasonable value and return instead of getting stuck in
a very slow loop searching 256K for the bogus pointer.

P035/B04 includes the ability to run with AR/ARX parity trap enabled.
         It runs on systems with 365x disks.

P035/B06 fixes the problem of bogus "search errors" on systems with 3675 disks.

P035/B07 would normally be called P035/B06-1.  It fixes the problem of THUNGs
	 on systems with 3 strings on a single 3674 and on 3652 disks.

P035/B08 would normally be called P035/B06-2.  It allows the system to continue
	 after an FTACFC stopcode, which occurs only when unrecoverable read or
	 write errors occur on one FTA while a second FTA is doing I/O.

With the possible exception of system 39, we want to be running /B08 on all
systems in the Fremont Data Center.

   9. Your current license

  10. Why do you need whatever licenses you have.  Please be specific on
      each and every license listed in item 9.  If you do not know why you
      have a particular license, please say so.  If you have a particular
      need for more license than you have, please say so, and why.

      If you are a manager and require license only because one of your
      subordinates requires the license to do their job, please say so

Subject: Maximum jobs versus disks. 

Our current monitor configuration can handle only 32 jobs when 64 disks 
(8 strings) are defined.  Lowering the number of disks to 48 allows 80 jobs,
and with 32 disks 128 jobs can be handled.

These limits are based on the restriction currently in ONCE that the entire
monitor (including the symbol table) fit in 112K of unpaged core.

Subject: "Brought F29 up on NEWMON manually"... 

Brought F29 up on NEWMON (P035/B08) manually to rerun HS2287 ONTYME
accounting tape.  This was done to see if the system would cacrash with the same STOPCODE that occurred on 22 Jun.

After bringing the system up, I mounted this tape of FTA2
and started the restore.  I also mounted a tape on FTA1 and started
storing the directory of UTIL to it.

The accounting tape stopped after "Creating User Information" typed
out (same place as before).  The TITO tape stopped shortly after this.
Approximately one minute later, F29 went down with same "KAK" stopcode.

(That's KAF, not KAK)

I then dismounted the tapes and brought the  system up.  I have the
hardcopy if additional information is needed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks Rick.  This is very valuable information.  Please save the tape
that causes the crash.  We will be talking about this in our group meeting
this afternoon and come up with another patch/fix to the monitor to
fix the problem.

Subject: License... 

As per our "wall" discussion, I'd like you to think about this:

What if,  license on a file worked like a "protection".
          If a file has more license than the process attempting to
          update or supersede (ENTER UUO) then the "ENTER" fails.
          Rename to reduce the license (or increase the license) would
          always succeed if the process has the final license.

So, just as you cannot delete a file marked NO NO NO, you can rename it
    to a lower protection, and delete it.

So, a file with license can only be copied by a process with that or greater
    license.  It can be renamed, reducing the license, then copied, renamed
    or deleted.

    This also prevents accidently renaming a file, losing it's license, and
    never knowing it....  a current problem, not so much a security risk.

--------------------
So, what about TELECOPY, of files with license?  Trying to copy files to
files on other systems without license would fail (as it should).  TELECOPY
should be fixed as part of implementing such a scheme (as it would need to
be fixed, in order to work correctly).
--------------------

What do we really lose?  The convenience of being able to create a file and
then have to manually put license on it.  If a file has a license and it is
to be superseded, the license goes away (unless it is specified in the ENTER)
(which many programs such as LINK do not know enough to do).

I'm not advocating this change.... I just want us to think about it, and
how something similar could help our "license" problems with new, restored,
updated, copied, stolen programs and/or data.

One feature we would like to keep is the current one where if the job has
enough license, and the existing destination file has any license, then a
superseding ENTER preserves license.  That is "!GET (OSU)LOGINN" followed
by "!SSAVE (SYS)LOGINN" preserves the old protection and license.  Is this
what you meant by "license should be like protection"?  I agree that a frame
that has WF but not JL should get an error on ENTER if it were to try to
supersede (SYS)LOGINN.SHR.

Subject: License disappears (sometimes) on RENAME. 

After reading Carl's message I did some testing.  I GFDed to SPL, and then,
without setting license, I tried ".RENAME COPY.S=COPY.SAV".  The file COPY.SAV
had JL and RF license before and after.  (And still after renaming back to
COPY.SAV.)  Then I tried ".RENAME (JMS)COPY.SAV=(SPL)COPY.SAV".  The license
disappeared when the file changed directories!  After reinstating JL and RF,
I tried renaming it the other direction, from my logged in directory to the
GFDed directory.  License went away.  One last test was to reset everything
and set WF only on my frame and then try renaming across directories.  This
time RF survived (since it is implied by WF) but JL did not.

Until today I did not know that license got left behind on a RENAME.  It is
not what I expected.  However the preservation of license when doing
 "RENAME (SYS)PROGRAM.OLD=(SYS)PROGRAM.SAV" is a feature worth preserving.

Subject: License again 

Yes, want to preserve:  load/get program; SSAVE program     keeps license
      if you have the same license... although, if you don't have ALL the
      license, I think it ought to fail... you should NOT be able to do
      anything by way of ENTER if you do not have same or greater license.

Rename across directories, if you don't have license, it goes away... as
      expected.  Are you saying that if you HAVE the license, it also goes
      away just because it is across directories?  (It should always go
      away if you don't have it [now] whether or not it is across dir's
      but you should be able to rename license across dir's if you have it!)

My suggestion is to make the enter fail, if you do NOT h
ave enough license
which would cause a "protection"/"license" failure and abort...  so people
can't "accidently" rename or copy over a file that has license.

Subject: CRA002.SAV indicates that the SA10 is failing intermitantly. 

The PC in CH1 shows that an SA10 interrupt was detected using by the
CONSO 274,400000 at SA0INT.  However the CONI 274,SA0STS at CRSDEV+3 is 0!
If the SA10 is indeed flaking out, that would explain the SAXINX problem.

Subject: 8 of 10 crashes on 33 are SAXINX 

Most of F33's crashes are KAF stopcodes, but the crash dumps show that a
SAXINX info stopcode had just occurred and the info hadn't gotten a chance to
type out on the CTY.  One crash implied that the SA10 stopped working the
time it was determined that the SA10 caused the interrupt and the time the
status was read to determine which channel caused the interrupt.  The
changes to COMMOD in /B09 will get more information and try to continue.
Note: This does not affect F29's problem with reading ONTYME accounting.
That problem is still under investigation.     /Joe

The 1pm Friday meeting has been canceled due to insufficient data.
I believe /B09 will help F33's KAF stopcodes due to heavy FTA usage.
However F29's KAF stopcodes from the ONTYME accounting is a different problem,
and needs further study.  I will send another message later today.  /Joe

Subject: Found loop in FTASER. 

FTASER has several phases of "DC-R" recovery (DataCheck-Read).  Phase 1 is to
re-read the record forwards.  Phase 2 is to read the record backwards.  Phase 3
is to continue reading backwards if phase 2 worked but did not read the entire
record.  The calculation to determine where to resume reading misinterpreted
the command list and got into an infinite loop (causing KAF).  The check for
getting out of the loop failed if the current command list did not start at
the beginning of the area reserved for command lists.  The fix was to stop at
a zero word as well.

**************

The system does not hang anymore.  However, the OSIRUS RESTORE program tries
to re-read the same record over and over again.  But that's its problem (or
possibly a misfeature in FOROTS).  P035/B10 will be put on F29 tonight, and
eventually all other systems in Fremont.    /Joe

Subject: Hotline (type) call 

System F30 was experiencing a rise in hard device errors on BPA6.  They
took the system down to do a PAKCOP of the pack (3675's) and saw the same
hardware check problem we had with system 38 two weeks ago.

Rick called and wanted to know if it was OK to use Joe's modified PAKCOP.
I said, go... and we realized that that version was for 3650's in blocks.
We decided to run ASP version 7 to copy out the pack to tape and then do
a restore to a new pack.

We did a compare of the save prior to the restore and found 78(*) pages that
did not copy exactly.  Nothing was done to see how "off" the pages were.
We restored the tapes to a new drive/pack and I created a file with 78 pages
in it for DSKCLN to find multiply used pages and mark the files bad.

System came up with a FULL DSKCLN and reported errors as expected in RECOV.SYS
and on the console.  One UFD was affected.  Operations has the list of files
from FNDBAD to restore and the UFD name to work through the all-files and
backups.

I told them to call us if they had any more problems.

We received a verbal "thanks" from both Bob Fischer and Cheryl Eldred for
saving them a rebuild.

Subject: RDIST program (finally) 

I've finally written RDIST as promised.  It updates files on multiple systems.
I've attached the manual page for it.  Locations are:
  source:  (XEXEC:29)RDIST.SAI
  document:(XEXEC:39)RDIST.PUB
I'll be putting it on XEXEC everywhere soon.  Advise of suggestions.  Please
consider fixing TELECOPY to allow the TALK command in a command file and to
not always update existing file (i.e. supercede).  -Bill
   (XEXEC)RDIST                    Tymcom-X                     (XEXEC)RDIST


   SYNOPSIS

           Remote file distribution.

   SYNTAX

           RDIST outfile=f1,f2,...,fn/USER:u/HOST:h/CHECK/LIST/TRACE/VERBOSE

   DESCRIPTION

           RDIST maintains  duplicate copies of  selected files  on multiple
           systems.   This is  accomplished by  building a  circuit  to each
           system  and running  the (SPL)FINDIT  program to  obtain creation
           date, checksum, protection and license data on the  files.  RDIST
           then  builds a  TELECOPY command  file and  executes  TELECOPY to
           update those files which have incorrect checksums.

           The parameters are as follows:

             outfile=      output file for status log; default is no log

             f1,f2,...,fn  files to be updated, each may contain user name
                           and wild cards; if no user name is given the
                           one given by /USER:u is assumed; default is *.*

             /USER:u       login name to build circuit under (requires AC
                           license); default is current user

             /HOST:h       list of host numbers to update; default is all

             /CHECK        do everything but run TELECOPY

             /LIST         generate list only; does not compare files or
                           run TELECOPY; replaces running FINDIT via MHX

             /TRACE        show circuit traffic on terminal for debugging

             /VERBOSE      show status of each file, even if its current;

   CAVEATS

           The program has no way to correct bad protection or license.

I have to report to the San Jose Facility, Juror Assembly Annex, at 9:30 am,

ADDRESS CHECK usually means that the SAV or SHR file is corrupted.  If you know
the name of the program, you can see if it has the same checksum on another
system.  If it happens on your terminal, you can type "VERSION" to get the
name of the program.  /Joe

I donno why, but depending on what reason (this is a guess) when a circuit
zap occurs, sometimes the job just goes away... It happens to me an awful
lot, (and I have DETACH-CONTINUE set also!) and I usually just shrug it off.
Maybe there is a bug in the monitor, it is selective, and depends on timing

Thanks for taking care of that.  58 went down in the middle of the
distribution.  I think we will continue to see these problems until
somebody fixes TELECOPY, in specific, TELECOPY always does both a
LOOKUP and ENTER on the file and thus runs in UPDATE mode, even when
NO UPDATE is specified.  This is clearly a bug.

Subject: SETOP should clear input buffer if no DRWSPR.EPO file. 

There is a very small window between the time that PJ copies the new oper
password file to SYS and the time that it sets WC license on it.  If an MHX
job just happens to try to use "O$" during that time, SETOP complains that
there is "NO PASSWORD FILE" and exits without clearing the input buffer.
When this happenned to me today, my oper password showed up on the command
line where anyone looking over my shoulder could see.  Because of MEXEC, it
tried to run a program matching the first word of my oper password.  This
word was then made available to SYSTAT for the world to see.

This is not good.

Of course PJ should be fixed to specify the license in the enter rather
than doing a rename after the fact.  Aside from that, OPER should also
always take a password, regardless of weather there is an oper password
file or if its bad or if the name specified does not exist.  This is the
same strategy we'll be releasing in the network as soon as we get a round
tuit.  [it also makes guessing harder]  -Bill

I could not find a dump of the crash from 30-JUN-87.  However, the message
"?PAR ERR 277 001 300" means that a memory parity error was detected by
Unibus Adaptor #3.  This indicates a possible hardware problem in the
memory boards, the memory controller, or UBA3.

I looked at CRA001.SAV which was a crash dump from 8-JUN-87.  In it, the
IRING and ORING pointers indicate that either the KMC or the LSI-11 wasn't
doing its job since the ORING was completely full.  Most of the time when
this happens to us, the LSI-11 has halted.  We simply reload the LSI-11 and
the KS2020 and don't bother with saving a crash dump.

As for the stopcode message, TTYBNP means Block I/O Not in Progress.
This can happen when the LSI-11 scribbles garbage in the IRING just before
it halts.  There's not much that can be done other than reloading the LSI-11
node and the KS2020.

Subject: Memo to Ed Roop about 32 disks. 

The following is in (M33)32DISK.MEM.  Whoever is going to the meeting in
Solar Way at 13:00 on 7/02/87 can give copies to Roop, Fischer, etc.
			/Joe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the TYMCOM-X Support Group.
In reference to memo from Ed Roop dated June 4, 1987.

We are currently running a monitor with 32 disk addresses defined.  F74
has 29 active spindles disks, F38 had 28 active disks before it was
converted.  Running with 32 units of model 3675 disks is not a problem.

We have run a test monitor configured for a 3652 system with 32 addresses
and a test monitor configured for a 3652 system with 64 addresses.
Although only 1 string of 3652 disks was connected at the time, we see no
problems with using a second string of 3652 disks due to the uniformity
of disk addressing.  All 32 addresses go through the same 3674 controller.

Due to the current limitation on the size of the resident monitor, a
system can be configured for more than 32 addresses only at the expense
of the number of jobs the system can handle.

        A monitor with 32 disks can be defined with 128 jobs.
        A monitor with 48 disks can be defined with  80 jobs.
        A monitor with 64 disks can be defined with  32 jobs.

Note that each additional string of 3652 disks (with 16 addresses)
reduces the maximum number of jobs by 48.  There is an absolute maximum
of 64 units per structure.  Defining the DSKB structure with more than
32 units is not recommended.  Recovering from an HDA failure on a 48 unit
DSKB would take more than 48 hours of down-time.

Unless the sytems were to use multiple structures, we cannot recommend
attaching more than 32 disk units per CPU.

The THUNGs on BPA12 and BPB6 are a side affect of the HDEV:4 on BPA13.
I tried to read CYL:1 HEAD:22 RECORD:23 4 times to see if it would cause
an EVENT stopcode BADPAG on unit 12 page 511.  It did not.  However, it
took more than 3 seconds for the monitor to do all the retries on that page,
which caused the THUNGs.  BPA12 and BPB6 were not hung - the monitor was
ignoring them while doing the retries.  The best way to clear this disk
error is to ASSIGN and DEASSIGN an alternate track to CYL:1 HEAD:22.
Due to the way SPAGES is used, no data will be lost.   /Joe

SUBJECT>   ASP Dump Testing on F58


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This coming weekend, starting at 0000, 18 Jul, there will be two (2) 
ASP dumps taken on this system.  F58 is scheduled to be up by 1200,
18 Jul.

The first dumpt will be taken with Version 6 from the directory of (SYS).
The second ASP dump will be taken with version 7 from the directory of (OSU).
Use the current rotation set of tapes for the first dump.  Make up a 
second set (15 tapes total) for the second dump.  Label the tapes as:

     F58 ASP DUMP (VER 7)

     SET 0       TAPE #

After the second dump is completed and verified, the system will be taken
down.  Call me when you are half way through the verification of the
second dump.

Subject: RDIST suggestions. 

I noticed that /USER applies to the aux circuit that runs FINDIT and FINDIT
itself, but not to TELECOPY.  That is, when logged in as JMS, TELECOPY can read
or create files in M33, but cannot supercede files in M33 because the aux
circuit built by TELECO is for JMS not M33.  That's the main reason why I added
the /MASTER switch, so that RDIST could be run on the destination system GFD'd
to the right directory as a SUBMIT job.  (My changes are in (JMS:39)RDIST.SAI).

Another thing to consider in the next version is a /GATEWAY command so that
B39 can be kept current with the rest of the world.  /Joe

 Joe;

Need to know where the MACRO programs are for the new Version of ASP, ONCE,
PAKCPX, PAKCP5 and OAKCOP.

That's PAKCOP not OAKPAK.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick,
 
The following is a list of topics operation's personnel would liked addressed
in PDP seminars.
 
1)  Hardware
    A)  Define each component and its purpose
    B)  How each component interacts with the other
 
2)  Memory
    A)  What is it?
    B)  How and why do we deselect memory?
 
3)  System Structure & File Structure
    A)  What is it?
    B)  How is it defined and why?
    C)  Disolving and defining a file structure.
    D)  Blocks vs pages
    E)  How are files stored on disk? What are the differences between
        3675's, 3650's and 3652's.
 
4)  ASP, ALLFILES & Daily Backups
    A)  What each one is.
    B)  What each would be used for.  (i.e. rebuild, restore of bad file)
 
5)  Monitors
    A)  What are they?
 
6)  DSKCLN
    A)  What a FULL DSKCLN is and what it does?
    B)  What a FAST DSKCLN is and what it does?
    C)  How to determine if a FULL or FAST is required.
 
7)  Pakcop
    A)  What is it?
    B)  How does it work?
 
8)  Rebuilds
    A)  Process of a rebuild
    B)  What backup (Allfiles, Daily & ASP) is appropriate for rebuilds.
        (Examples of different scenarios.)
 
 
 
These are only topics that we find that we would absolutely need presented.
Additional topics that you or Tymcom10 software/hardware support feel would
be beneficial to operation's personnel would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks,
 
Cheryl

It just runs FINDIT so...
I suppose I could check for .TMP and try to handle it gracefully, but the
problem here is not .TMP, its binary file names.  The program RDIST blew
up here because it got two files with the same (reported) name.  I guess
that they each contained an embedded blank and differed following that so
the cvxstr routine in sail (which does the wrong thing) stops at the first
blank.  I'm not sure what the best fix would be.  Maybe FINDIT could output
otherwise illegal file names in some special way like '123456654321.XYZ.
Suggestions?  -Bill

Actually, I would think FINDIT would want to ignore .TMP, wouldn't it?

I think FINDIT does ignore *.TMP unless you explicitly specify .TMP...
Next time I get a chance I'll verify that... but that's what it used to
do when it was first written.

THE 2020 CRASHED ON SUNDAY NIGHT ABOUT 10PM.  IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS BECAUSE
OF RUNNING OUT OF DISK SPACE ONLY, BUT I THOUGHT YOU MAY FIND SOMETHING
HELPFUL IN THE CRASH SAVE.  IT IS IN (SYS)CRA001.SAV.

1.  As long as 62 and 930 are both working, we can reload the microbases from
the other CPU.  The 2020 can reload its microbase and 2346, but nothing else.
6657:	Use NODLOD on 62.  10115 and 2346 must be up.
10115:	Use NODLOD on 930.  6657 and 2346 must be up.
2346:	Use NODLOD on 62, 930, or 95.  The host's base must be up.
2770:	Use NODLOD on 62 or 930.  Intervening nodes must be up.
6760:	Use NODLOD on 95 running in CONSOLE mode.
Note:  After a complete power failure, 6657 and 10115 must be reloaded from
the network.  With host 57 gone, WE CAN'T RUN LOADII!!!!!! 

2. Out Dial information is in the INFO tree, topic OUTDIAL.

Subject: PDP-10 coding trick 

  In putting together my own octal print routine for my SETOP endeavor
I chose to combine the octal and decimal print routines into one.  This
had the side effect that octal numbers with the sign bit set became
a weird set of punctuation marks (since I had an unsigned print routine).

		  OOPS!

  If you start with a standard routine such as this...

  num = 1
  rem = num+1

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

  I came up with this interesting bit of code as a work around that I had
never encountered in any bag of PDP-10 coding tricks...

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
; ** begin trick **
	EXCH	num,rem			; setup number in remainder word
	SETZ	num,			; for 2-word divide instead
	LSHC	num,1			; shift sign (if any) to high word
	LSH	rem,-1			; shift low word back into position
	DIV	num,rad			; first divide, results same as IDIV
	CAIA				; or JRST .+2 to skip first divide
; ** end trick **
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

; Have you ever seen this used anywhere before?

PS.  TYMCOM-X only...
    replace
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)
	OUTCHR	num
    with
	OUTCHI	"0"(num)		; outchr immediate

Subject: 56035C rebuilt for JOBS=160 (as well as PORTS=200). 

System 56 is currently running a monitor with 128 jobs and 128 ports.
If there are more jobs using two ports each (such as LOADII, TELECO, AUXIO, etc)
than there are jobs detached (CHKPNT, PAM, XEXEC, etc), then the system will
run out of ports before it runs out of job slots.  When this occurs, the SUP
will tell the CONSAT output the message "host out of ports" as the reason for
failure of the login request.

Back in May, we boosted PORTS to ^D200.  That by itself would allow about 3
more jobs to get logged in, and then SCNSER will have to output the message
"frame capacity exceeded" when all 127 jobs were in use.  That would not
really solve the problem.  Therefore I have boosted JOBS to ^D160.  CONF56.MAC
has been updated in (M33:930,:34,:33) and (OSP:33), and the new 56035C.SAV
copied to (M33:56).

Setting JOBS=160 and PORTS=200 should keep them happy for a while.  I would
expect the KL to get bogged down before they exceed 159 jobs.

Su:  PDP-10 Inactivity Timeout
------------------------------

Joe,

A few weeks ago, Barb V. mentioned to you that I was investigating
an inactivity timeout for PDP-10 usernames.  I'm sorry that I didn't
get back to you sooner, but I have been off chasing other monsters
the last few weeks.

Barb has mentioned that there is a 15-minute timeout available, but that
it has to be set by the user on login.  I nned to find a way to
automate this.  Is it possible to set this through an init file?

The application that we need it mostly for is to zap ELF circuits that
are still connected, but it would be useful for any user accessing
the PDP-10 host through a connection with large connect time costs.

Please let me know as many details of accessing this timeout.
I will be very grateful.

Best Regards,

Dan

(SYS)NAD.SAV has Write Files license.  This is a very serious security breach.

Thank you for checking with us.  It is bound to screw up
somebody, but nobody at NTD.  I think (SYS)NAD is used
mostly by Tymnet operations and private network customers.
It seems to me they need an alternative means to access
their code, but I don't understand what the procedures
are so I can't suggest such an alternative.  *SIGH*  I
think this is gross negligence on someone's part, but it
is unfortunate that our customers will be the ones to
suffer for it.  I knew about the WF on NAD, but was told
that it enforced its own security, which it at least used
to because I frequently have gotten protection failures
trying to read source code I'm assembling (being in a
different GAN than most of NTD) when I forget to set RF.

I propose more investigation before any action, even
as gross as this appearently is, it can probably be
left alone a couple more days.  I would normally
volunteer to help investigate, but this is a very bad
time.

Thanks

It sounds like you have done more investigation.  I did a tiny bit, too, and
I see (SOURCE)NAD with HF on 70.  Presumably that is the only way that
a customer can access the files in (SOURCE) since they are mostly ALL RD NO.
However, if NAD does not enforce security itself, this is still a problem
because we do not want customers to be able to read/write even the source
directory except to assemble (but not make listing of) the files therein.
Although this is a smaller box than (SYS)NAD with WF, it still needs to be
addressed one way or another.  -Bill

In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 3 Aug 87 22:09:51 PDT

SAXINY is new in /B10.  It means that COMMOD got an interrupt from the SA10
and the unit number stored in location 301 or 305 does not match the kontroller
data blocks.  For instance, if the disk channel interrupts with unit 277 (or
unit 0), COMMOD will check if it belongs to BPA (units 300-317) or BPB (units
320-337).  Since there is no Kontroller that claims that unit, COMMOD can't
do anything with the interrupt other than dismiss it.  Prior to /B10 there
was no indications when this occurred.  I added EVENT stopcode SAXINY so that
it would show up on the CTY.  My guess is that a disk caused a transfer-done
interrupt, but the 3672 reported a bogus unit.  COMMOD complains that it got
an interrupt from an unknown unit, then FILIO says THUNG because it missed
an interrupt it was expecting.  I will see if SAXINY can be modified to output
more info to catch the bad unit.  /Joe

In the right half:
  400000 = Interrupt request from SA10
   20000 = SA10 channel 1 (disk) is enabled for interrupt
    1000 = The "GO" flag is set for SA10 channel 1 (disk)
     100 = Status available from channel 0 (tape)
      40 = Status available from channel 1 (disk)
       3 = SA10 is using PI channel 3

In the left half:
  400000 = Dummy bit set to indicate that one of bits 29-32 are set in RH
     000 = Octal unit device address (8 bits)

SAXINY means that one of the two disk controllers has told the SA10 to
interrupt the PDP-10, but the controller did not identify itself.  Controller
BPA (which is wired for 'C0' to 'CF') is supposed to report unit device
addresses in the range 300 to 317 and controller BPB (wired for 'D0' to 'DF')
is supposed to report unit device addresses in the range 320 to 337.  All the
SAXINY reports I have looked at show a unit device address of 000.  One of
the two controllers is returning bad status.

SAXINY occurs whenever the system gets an interrupt and cannot identify which
particular disk (or controller) was the cause of the interrupt.  THUNG occurs
when a disk transfer is started, but the "done" interrupt gets lost.  I would
expect each THUNG to be preceded by a SAXINY report.     /Joe

     TRASH, TRASH and more TRASH.  Here is how we are going to get rid
     of it!!.

     Carts marked with TRASH will be placed in each building at
     various locations.  They may be used by anyone, and Facilities
     Maintenance or the janitor will empty them as needed.  If you
     need immediate service, call 446-8048 for action.  PLEASE! do not
     put any WET trash into these carts.

     Now is a good time to get rid of outdated phone books and
     directories.  There will be a limited number of new San Jose
     books available for the Fremont movees, so everyone else please
     bring your 1987 books with you.

     The ELECTRICAL POWER STRIPS, EXTENSION CORDS, HEATERS AND FANS
     will not be needed or allowed (except in special circumstances)
     in the new buildings.  Please leave them on your desk for pickup
     by Facilities Maintenance.

     If you have any questions, please contact your local maintenance

At 10:20am Saturday my beeper went off, the number it displayed was
800 854-6000.  No system number this time.  I called it, and was given
three of the "please hold on" recordings before it was answered.  I gave
my name, stated that I was responding to TYMCOM-X Support.  She was expecting
Osman, and "DEC System Support".  She also asked for my employee number,
meaning the 4-digit FSC payroll number, not the 6-digit ISG number.  They
had Osman on call until 5:30pm Monday instead of me.  It looks like we need
to have a more formal schedule, instead of just a sheet of paper on my wall.

I called Emile at the Fremont Data Center at 10:23am.  End of call.

Subject: RDIST missing files 

Hmmm.  That may be the same bug that causes "ls" to miss files.  All of
these programs use the (SAILIB)REDUFD routines which are strongly suspected
to be the source of this problem, although never reported before for the
RDIST or FINDIT programs.  Carl believes it has something to do with files
with strange names such as those found in (MAIL) with a PPN for a file name,
and those found in any directory with soft deleted files.  I suspect that
if the first character of a file name is a blank that other files which
follow that file in the UFD block may not be seen by REDUFD.  I have been
unable to see any obvious cause for this in the REDUFD source, but I only
looked at it for about 5 minutes one day.  I have not performed any
experiments.  -Bill

In-reply-to: your message of Tue, 18 Aug 87 19:24:23 PDT

We're not really part of .com officially, and hobbes shouldn't really be
using that name.  It isn't clear what our official address will be if we
ever get around to getting one.  Probably (for example) jms@x930.mdc.com
or possibly jms@x930.tymnet.com, but not likely since that's not our name.
Currently, there is no name server in TUMS or on the Unix systems, so I
(tums) assume that anything ending in .com .gov .arpa .edu, etc. is on
the DARPA internet and route it to office-1.  So, wrs@hobbes.Tymnet.com
is not likely to work, although I may make a special case check for it
and change it to just wrs@hobbes.Tymnet (kludge).  At any rate, I've lost
track of your question.  I think you mea to understand how we can be
addressed from other nets and the answer is: from usenet, only by explicit
path ...  ...oliveb!tymix!jms%x930, and from anywhere on the DARPA internet:
jms%x930.Tymnet@office-1.arpa (also <@office-1.arpa:jms@x930.Tymnet> but
that doesn't work in some mailers so some sites may not be able to send
that kind of address).  Did I answer your question?  -Bill

Subject: re:FINDIT %10 

New FINDIT %10 to be distributed soon...  Now includes ARGPAR.

The only visible change to anyone using FINDIT the old way is that the
line "End of SAIL execution." is no longer printed in any case, and some
programs such as RDIST may look for such a line to terminate processing.
The prompt has NOT been changed, so programs waiting for a second prompt
should not be affected.

Joe,
  I've removed the dependency on files in directory VMAP from FINDIT.  The
sources are now in directory SPL where they belong.  We need to talk about
/STICKY and whether/how we want to make it work in FINDIT.

I, for one, do not like having to specify the directory for every file when
only a single directory is being searched (especially when it's a long name)
but I do not want to lose the capability of searching for files in every
directory.

A new version of FINDIT.SAV has been installed on SPL and XEXEC on system
F32 and system D35.  The new version %10 of FINDIT uses the argpar package
and has two (2) switches: /CHECKSUM and /QUIET.  The default values are
/CHECKSUM (list checksums in formatted output) and /NOQUIET (allow output
to appear on the terminal when an output file is selected).

Oh yes, this means the output can be sent to a file and /QUIET says to send
it ONLY to the file, not to both the file and the terminal.

/NOCHECKSUM will cause six (6) blanks to be printed instead of the checksum
in the output, and of course, no checksumming of the files will be done.


To Joe:  Since you have RF on the file, I will let you transmit the new
         version to all systems... sufice that it is on 32 and 35 for now.

ARGPAR means that FINDIT can be run at command level.. however, I have made
sure that it acts just like it used to if you say FINDIT or R (SPL)FINDIT.

Subject: How to patch the CPU serial number into a monitor SAV file. 

There are three consecutive locations, starting at .CPLOG which describe
the CPU ID.  To look at them, use .CPLOG$6T/=<lf>=<lf>.
  .CPLOG has 2 or 3 letter hardware designation in LH, node number in RH.
  .CPCPU has 'KI', 'KL', etc in LH, APRID number (in decimal) in RH.
  .CPSNO has system number (such as 'F22') in sixbit.
The sixbit quantities can be left or right justified.  I changed 33035C.SAV to
22035C.SAV by using:
  .CPLOG/ $"/XXX/,,3374
  .CPCPU/ $"/KL/,,1421.
  .CPSNO/ $"/F22/
When the new KL is installed, the right half of .CPCPU must be changed.  /Joe

Subject: MUX 2096 is very slow today. 

As of 9/15, MUX hosts 2096 and 1274 have moved from Engines in Orchard Parkway
to Microengines in South Bay Center.  If you have nodes 2366 or 2367 in your
SWITCH.INI, they should be changed to 3170 and 3345 respectively.  I noticed
the change because host 2096 was having problems.  It was "2*OV" and "****"
meaning the link to its only neighbor was overloaded both directions and
had a high line error rate.  1274 was better.   /Joe

Subject: [1, 4].UFD damaged on F26. 

The first UFD data page for (SYS:26) was on BPA3 page 10010.  That was one
of the pages that PAKCOP could not read, and had pointers to LOGINN and RPG.
DSKCLN aborted with "Error in RIB - wrong hash code" and "Critical file
damaged".  Page 0 was indeed garbage, and the 2nd page for that hash code
was 10.  After zeroing the offending paged and putting 10 in the link at 777,
the UFD was readable.  Having REFLAG, I restored all of SYS until TITO asked
to overwrite a file.  Typing control-C at that point caused TITO to report
that 102 files were processed, exactly one page worth.  F26 is running a
full DSKCLN at this moment.  /Joe

The project was canceled before anyone wrote TUMS.HLP, so...  there is
actually no documentation.  If he wants his Ontymes forwarded, he just
needs to send me his ontyme name, password and PDP-10 user name.  It is
somewhat expensive, so I don't want to do a whole bunch, but a few is OK.
There is no interface at this time to the 370 except through PROFS which
I think they are not running.  If he is in the MDC PROFS system, he can
send mail to the PDP-10 via PROFS by sending a NOTE (must be a note) to
the address TUMSGATE SLVMCL1 and including the real destination address
in the first line of the note as follows (for example):

To: Bill SOley <WRS@B39.Tymnet> (TUMS)

The "To:" must begin in column 1 and the (TUMS) must not have any
trailing blanks.  He can send to multiple addresses this way, by
just seperating them with commas or using multiple To: lines or both.
He can also leave out the name and <>...

To: WRS@B39.Tymnet (TUMS)

Oh well.  -Bill

One warning about sending ONTYME name, ONTYME password, and PDP-10 user name
to WRS:  once this is set up, you not have any messages on ONTYME anymore.
They all get forwarded to the PDP10 system of your choice and are removed
from your ONTYME "in" and "in old" folders.  People can still send to your
ONTYME username, but you will be reading them on the PDP10.  You can send
to ONTYME users from any PDP10.  In otherwords, you don't have to deal with
ONTYME's archaic command processor anymore.

I currently have it set up so that mail sent to TXS.J/SMITH@ONTYME or to
FSC.JM/SMITH@ONTYME is forwarded to JMS@D35.TYMNET, and mail from me to
any ONTYME username gets sent as being from TXS.J/SMITH@ONTYME.  I have
a MAIL.FWD file on all PDP10s that causes TUMS mail on all systems to be
forwarded to JMS@D35.  Since we have modified crashmail on F33 to use TUMS,
that means that system 33's crashmail to me is arriving here at D35.

When P035/D is ready, it will be easy to get all the Dallas PDP10 crash mail
to one PDP10.  Use "R SENDMAIL" to JMS if you have any more questions.  /Joe

Subject: Known problem: Job in ^C but no prompt. 

If you ever get job 1 immediately after loading the system, you should log
out and back in again.  Especially if you have to supply the date and time.
If you wait until after EXECX starts, there does not seem to be a problem.

Problem: After running a program (such as GFD or OPER), the program finishes,
but the user does not get a prompt.  Typing Control-T says the job is in ^C
state, but the user has to type a Contro-C to get the monitor prompt.  The
situation lasts until the job logs out.  Cause unknown, but never seen after
2nd network login.		/Joe

Subject: Resync with base. 

In reference to ONTYME from Tom Marconi on Friday 10/30/87 12:05:33.
Subj: DECsystem10 P035/C monitor with E-BUS uprev.

It is now possible to reload the EBUS base and not have to recycle the
PDP-10 host.  This capability is a result of recent hardware and software
changes; an ECO to fix the DMA problem and a patch to SYSTEM.SAV.

The current monitor (P035/C) can handle the case where the base is reset
by being reloaded.  However, that monitor does not always recover gracefully
when the base is reset from its front panel.  The PDP-10 has to be running
the P035/C03 (or later) monitor to be able to resync with the base in
this case.

cases, someone was executing a PCOM job that was running AFD.  The system
hung by a command like "RUN AFDCOM;AFDPUT.TMP" because the input file
had more than 1024 characters.

We have been trying to warn everybody for over 3 years that programs like
(UTIL)COM and AFDCOM should not attempt to force the input of more than
one line of 72 characters.  Anything over 72 characters cannot be guarenteed
to work.  Any procedure that needs more input must be converted to use the
":COM filname" feature of PCOM and SUBMIT if it is to be relied upon.

Daily procedures that use the COM program (such as running accounting for
BILLING10) should be converted to PCOM style control files before the next
monitor release.  Documentation is in (*6NEWS)PCOM.DOC.

Subject: Format of customer version number. 

The following is available as item 70 of GETTAB table 11 in P035/C09 and later:
;VERMAJ is a single letter.       Currently "P"=^O20
;VERMIN is 3 decimal digits.      Currently "035"=^O43
;VERSUB (if present) is a slash followed by 1 or 2 letters /A-/Z, /AA-/AZ, etc.
;VERDEV is not present in released monitor, "01"-"99" for development.
;VERPAT (if present) is a hyphen followed by letters or decimal digits.
;Digits indicate DDT patch to SYSTEM.SAV, letters indicate source patch.
;If VERPAT has letters, it gets 256 added to it.
	A00CVN=: BYTE (6) VERMAJ (9) VERMIN (6) VERSUB (6) VERDEV (9) VERPAT

Subject: Version number 

Again, (today is not my day), I was mistaken.  The version number is
a decimal number.  Herewith is what TITO looks at, for it;'s feature test.

;
;	The definition of a version number string is xyyy-Pmmm/zrr-nn
;	where
;	    x	is a center number, e.g. "C" for Cupertino
;	  yyy	is the system number, e.g. "930", or "33", etc.
;	    -	separates the system number from the monitor name.
;	    P	is historical and is always "P".
;	  mmm	is the major version in decimal, currently "034".
;	    /	separates the major and minor versions.
;	   zz 	is the minor version, normally a single letter (A-Z)
;		however it may be more, thus A-Z is less than AA.
;		also: AA + 1 is BA (not AB), thus each letter is
;		valued at <1-26>+<1-26 *26>+<1-26 *26^2>...
;	   rr	is a development revision and should not normally
;		appear on customer systems, e.g. /K34.
;	    -	separates the version number from the patch count.
;	   nn	is the patch count and initially is not present,
;		e.g.  /K-7  or  /K34-1.
;

This took a considerable amount of sleuthing to put together when I di it
way back when for TITO, and the only thing "wrong" with this defnition is
that the "P" may not be "P".  MONED1 is hardcoded to look for "Pnnnnn.MEM"
so we will have to change that if we go to Q001/A  {Yuk, it looks terible}

Subject: XEXEC Monitor solution! 

Joe,
  I've come up with a solution to the problem XEXEC has with the universal
identifier JBTUID which currently restarts at 1 each time the system is
reloaded.  If instead of using a monotonically increasing number, we set
the UID to the universal-date-time, we will be guaranteed of unique UIDs
that will never be reused.  Thus, if a job number and UID match at any time
we know we have the right job.

  Of course, we know the UDT is accurate to 1/3 second, so what do we do
about jobs that would have the same UDT?  Simple... since we keep the last
UID, we now keep the last UDT used for a UID and if the current UDT matches,
we increment it by 1  (1/3 second isn't going to hurt anything).  It's a
small possibility that the UID could get ahead of the UDT but it wouldn't
stay ahead for very long.

  And last, but not least, we can redirect .GTJLT (130) to point to JBTUID
and be able to obtain the login time for a job.

  The change should be in FRMSER in FRMASN where the UDT is incremented and
set for each frame

Subject: XEXEC Monitor solution! 

Joe,
  I've come up with a solution to the problem XEXEC has with the universal
identifier JBTUID which currently restarts at 1 each time the system is
reloaded.  If instead of using a monotonically increasing number, we set
the UID to the universal-date-time, we will be guaranteed of unique UIDs
that will never be reused.  Thus, if a job number and UID match at any time
we know we have the right job.

Hello Joe
     Another question for you. We are attempting to set up a console area 
in the COEES area to monitor all the systems by using tubes. Every area has
a console hooked up accept the KL10. We ran a cable from a VT100 terminal 
in the COEES area to the KL but it won't reach. A extension was hooked up
so it could reach the DN87 which was a success, but the terminal 
would not work.
       The VT100 was discounted from the cable in COEES area and hooked up
directly to the DN87. Know problem the terminal worked. My question to you
is , can the KL handle that distance to receive data on the terminal were
it would work.
         P.S The console area is set up were we have our P.C.

Subject: How to have PDP-10 mail forwarded to ONTYME. 

To have all PDP10 mail (including crash mail) forwarded to ONTYME, create
a file in your directory called MAIL.FWD and insert your ONTYME name, an
"at" sign, the ONTYME server name, and the suffix ".ONTYME".  For example,
if (DANIELSR)MAIL.FWD had the one line:
	OPERA.SUP@EMSTXS.ONTYME
then all PDP10 mail (including SEND, SENDMAIL, and TUMS) would be forwarded
to OPERA.SUP on the EMSTXS engine.  Note that name and address is required,
no password needed for forwarding mail.

Your MAIL.FWD file has to exist on all systems your username is valid on.
The easiest way to duplicate it to all systems in the Fremont Data Center
is by "RUN (SPL)CPY;MAIL.FWD/CENTER:F".  That will run TELECOPY in your
behalf.  After it is finished, you can "RUN (SPL)TELCHK" and hit Return
twice to type and delete 0nnTEL.COM and 0nnTEL.OUT files.

Please show memo about MAIL.FWD to anyone currently getting crash mail.
Tell Sharon that I won't need here ONTYME password after all, but she will
have to clear out her existing crash mail - MAIL.FWD only affects new mail,
not already received mail.

By the way: It is very easy to have PDP10 mail forwarded to ONTYME; getting
ONTYME mail forwarded to the PDP10s is possible, but a little more difficult.
Also, it is an all-or-nothing deal - when all ONTYME messages are forwarded,
they can't be read using ONTYME anymore.    /Joe

rdmail uses the sail parser, tums uses one I wrote in FLIB.  I will put
it on the list of things to do to convert rdmail to use flib, until then
anyone having a dot in their username should just use tums to read their

I think getting rid of the dot is the best solution since nobody is about

The problem is in the CVFIL filespec decoder in the SAIL runtimes.  I showed
the problem to Mike and Adele ages ago after Scott went to NTD and it was
tabled by them because of declining language support.  CVFIL uses the same
routine to read usernames as it does file identifiers, only allowing twelve
characters instead of 6.  Changing the code to use a different routine that
accepts "." as well as the other special characters allowed in usernames is
trivial.  Then rebuilding the SAIL runtimes and re-distributing them is the
major "glitch"... Scott or Lois were the last to do this  and I'm not sure
what kind of documentation exists.

Bill, If you'd like us to make the change, we can...  let us know...

Subject: GAN-5 and other usernames 

Jan,
  There are a reasonable number of usernames that currently exist on the
PDP-10s that no one ever logs into.  Is there really any reason for those
usernames to exist in TYMNET?  Is there any reason why a set of usernames
or directories cannot exist only on the PDP-10s?

  The only stipulation being that those usernames cannot be assigned to
users that want to use the PDP-10s.  A user could have the name (DEC) and
be valid to talk to the DECNET gateways 411 and 412, but not be valid on
the PDP-10s.  On the PDP-10s we could have username (DEC) with a designated
PPN that isn't billed against (since it would be an IPC internal name).

  Maybe we should get together to talk about this... since if you and Ed
and Nancy and I can agree on what I'm proposing, it would solve the problem
with duplicate UUNs and reduce the cost incurred by IPC and by us in TYMNET.
(Why should we have billable username sin TYMNET if no one ever logs in?)

Sorry I did not get back to you sooner.
If the VT100 connected to the DN87 does not work when cable is stretched
out the the COEES area, you can try using a "line driver".  This device
plugs into the cable from the DN87 and boosts the signal so that it is
strong enough to go thru the multiple extension cords.

Another thing to watch out for is extension cords versus null modems.
An extension cord is wired pin-for-pin, so that pin 2 at one end is
connected to pin 2 at the other end and pin 3 to pin 3.  A null modem
has pin 2 at one end connected to pin 3 at the other end and vice versa.
The VT100 requires one and only one null modem cable between it and the
DN87.  Plugging two null modems together does not work (even if it does
have the right combination of male/female connectors) because the signals
get crossed.

On a related subject; if the LA36 that is the CTY is connected to the KL
via a current loop, it should be possible to have 2 LA36's connected in
series in the current loop, with one near the KL and one in the COEES area.
Ask the CE if this can be done.

Bonnie called me at 10 minutes to 8, and I responded late (at 9:20pm when
I returned home) that the Japanese customers were complaining about SPOOL
and BIONIK and a fortran program TOKTYP that were causing them problems.

This same problem occurred last week, DEC 22, when the SA-10 problem caused
them to put 74 on the spare KL. I presume they swapped the SA-10 and brought
things up on 74's base... 'cause the japanese customers reported the problems
fixed shortly after that.

I checked out BIONIK and BIONIC, Bonnie and I checked out TELECOPY and all
block-io programs appeared to be having problems.  BIONIC received every 4th
byte transmitted (? really ?) and TELECOPY failed miserably.

I found out they were using node 2100 for the base (?the bad one?) and had
Bonnie call FSC to have the base swapped out for Node 6722's hardware.  It
took until 2:00 for them to get the base loaded after the swap out.

The system answered by 2:40 and I logged in and tested BIONIC.  Cindy from
operations checked out TELECOPY and it worked ok.  I asked her to put a note
on the base 2100, that BLOCK-IO doesn't work on this base.  (I thought the
bad base was retired?)

System 74 is up on the spare KL (that is why it was using node 2100) because
the SA-10 is still down... need to check with FSC to find out when X32 will
be back with it's own SA-10.

Ken-san,  
     
How do you doing ?  
I heard you come to nis on Jan. 18. I look forward to meeting you again    
in Japan. 
By the way, I think you read Mr. Ogura's ontyme ( msg# M40201 dated 07
Jan. 88 ).
Now, I have serious problem of katakana version "BIONIK" which is
described in his ontyme. 
Our clients asked to us many complain about this matter.    
However, I have no evidence which I can supply you now.
But, I think I like to get the evidence as soon as possible.
Then, when I get the evidence, I don't know the right person which I contact.   
     
Please let me know the name of persons and his ontyme-id.   
     
In my old memory, Carl Baltrunas and Dennis Cofley were responsibilty 
for PDP system. Are they still be responsible ?   
     
See again in Tokyo. 
Best regards.  
Kamoi

Ken,
  Without more details of what data was substituted, we cannot reasonably
determine the exact nature of the problem that NIS was experiencing with
regards to their point 1, (modified or substituted characters in units of
a word).

  However, what is known is that on December 22nd, there was a problem on
system 74 with the SA-10 (the interface between the PDP-10 I/O buss and the
disk and tape drives).  My understanding is that system 74 was taken down
at 7am PST and brought up on the spare KL-10 CPU in the Fremont data center
by 11am PST.  The spare cpu worked fine, however the base hardware connected
to this cpu has a known problem with BLOCK-IO (which affects TELECOPY, BIONIC,
BIONIK and others).

  When the SA-10 on system 74 was fixed, the system came back up on it's
proper hardware at midnight (PST) of the 22nd and the problems that NIS was
having went away.

  On December 31st, more spurious disk problems were reported, and again the
SA-10 was suspect.  So system 74 was again brought up on the spare cpu at 9:45
PST with the "broken" base.  As of this message, system 74 is still running on
the spare cpu.  It is scheduled to return to it's own hardware on the 15th of
January.

  On January 3rd NIS again reported problems with BIONIK to operations and I
was called in to look at them.  I determined that the problem appeared to be
related to BLOCK-IO since all other network I/O appeared to behave correctly.
I asked operations to reload the base, so that we could rule out corrupted
base code.  They had reloaded the system a couple of hours earlier to try to
fix the problem.  The problem didn't change and I looked at the base with
probe and found that F74 was on the spare cpu and there was a good probablility
that it was connected to the "broken" base hardware.  I had operations call in
maintenance and swap the base hardware.  This was done in the early a.m. on
January 4th.  When the system came up, we tested BIONIC and TELECOPY and the
problems appeared to be solved.

  As regards to the "broken" base that is referred to above.  We use the spare
cpu and it's base as our working test system for software support.  From time
to time we have experienced problems with BLOCK-IO due to an intermittant
hardware problem.  I believe it was an oversight that when F74 was moved to
the space cpu, the base hardware was not immediately swapped with a known good
base.  Once the problem was identified as the base, the "broken" base was
swapped out and I do not expect that NIS will encounter any more problems due
to the base.

Ken, please check with Rick Daniels to verify that no other changes were made
to the hardware configuration than those mentioned above (before responding
to NIS).  If their problems occurred during the times specified above, even
thought they may not have been detected until a later date, then we have
pin-pointed the cause of their problems.  If not, we need to try to reproduce
their problems before we can try to fix them.

Rick, the times for the hardware swaps came from the system log book and the
center log book.  We didn't see any additional reports of problems or hardware
swaps.  Please verify that there were no additional changes.   Thanks!

Rick, we need to be aware that whenever we swap cpu's in the future, that we
do not swap to the "broken" base hardware, until we know it has been fixed.

Ken,
  As for software support for the PDP-10s, our group still exists.  We are now
only 3: Carl Baltrunas, x6206;  Osman Guven, x6236; and Joe Smith, x6220.  Our
manager is Craig Fletcher, x6213.  Best way to reach us is via the secretary
at x6224 and that is the published number to call for software support.  Again
we do not usually deal with customers directly... they should call operations
at their local data center or their customer representative.  There is a group
in IPC or RCS in St. Louis which is supposed to support customers directly.
The contact name I have is Sheldon Rundell.  I don't have his number handy.

/Carl

PS.  About BIONIK... my understanding is that it is a version of the "old"
     BIONIC program before the modifications that I made 2 years ago when
     the new HSA code was put in place.  I really would prefer that NIS
     move their applications (I realize that many of their command sequences
     are burned into ROMs and cannot be changed) by having all new applications
     use the new (SYS) BIONIC program.  It has a KATAKANA command which then
     allows it to do the job that BIONIK was modified to do.  The default is
     ASCII.  We could modify BIONIC to immediatly use KATAKANA mode if the
     user's terminal is in set to KATAKANA, as most of the japanese customers
     are.  I just don't like having multiple versions of programs around to
     be supported when one version can do the job.

Subject: Summary 

Ken,
  I realize that I may not have been clear in summarizing what I said in the
previous memo.

  Basically, if the problems reported by NIS occurred entirely during the
periods when the "broken" base was known to be connected to the spare cpu
while system F74 was running on the spare cpu, then the problems are all
explained by the faulty base hardware.

  If they have other problems and we can reproduce them, we will try to
solve them as they provide sufficient information about reproducing them,
or when they occurred.

  We have seen some BLOCK-IO problems that are similar to those described
in the earlier mail messages, but those were pretty well fixed in recent
(within the last year) changes to the base code or the interface between the
base and TYMCOM-X.  If the character substitution problem continues to occur
we want to be able to reproduce it.

I've moved ROUTER.NET to (MAIL:29) so that will be the master copy.  If
you need to make changes regarding the PDP-10's, please make them in the
source file and then do a
    PCOM ROUTER
to spread it around.  RDIST in (MAIL) is a special kludge copy to deal
with gateways so it will even update 39.  If you would like any non-PDP-10
changes made, please check with me.  

Thanks for letting me know about 14, 17, 32.

Subject: F26 survived a base reload! 

F26's base was having problems (many jobs running LOGINN in TI state) and
it was reloaded.  Host 26 was not available thru net because the EBUS base
was waiting for the PDP10 to tell it what host number to use.  From KLDCP
I was able to deposit a host-to-base message in the ORING specifying the
host number and 127 ports.  When ORPPDP was poked, host 26 became visible.
OPER could log in, but others couldn't because the base thought the PDP10
was SHUT but F26 thought it had answered.  Setting SCHED 400000 and SCHED 0
cleared up that misconception.  I will add the code to send the right
messages to SCNSER; it may be worth adding a DDT patch to all P035/C when
it's ready.  /Joe

Subject: Formatting X32's disks. 

I found 2 bugs in PAKCOP(PAKCP5).   
If the 1st string controller is off-line (BPA0-BPA7), then PAKCOP assumes
the entire 3674 controller is off-line (BPA0-17 & BPB0-17).  PAKCP5 didnot
want to look at the string of 3650 disks on BPA10-17 as a result of
the string of 3675 disk on BPA0-7 being switched off.

2nd problem: Although I tried to make PAKCOP do everything SA10NW does,
something is missing.  Those paacks have not been formatted using PAKCOP,
because PAKCOP dies on CYL 559 with "Equip Check".    They were formatted with
SA10NW with FMTM=0, wich does cylinders 0-554 only.  When I tried FMTM=1,
SA10NW aborted because cylinders 555-559 were not set up.  I am now using
FMTM=-1 to re-write HA and R0 - this takes 2 secons per cylinder, 19 minutes
per pack.  After SA10NW finished, thhen I reformat thhem in pages.
I plan do do all but BPA16 - I'll leave that one as a test case for the
next version of PAKCOP.			/Joe

a.  HOW DO YOU FEEL THE SEMINAR WAS PRESENTED?

    THE SEMINAR WAS PRESENTED IN A WELL-ROUNDED MANNER.
NOT ONLY DID THE CLASS LEARN ABOUT BASIC OPERATOR FUNCTIONS
AND THIER IMPORTANCE, BUT ALSO THE FUNCTIONS OF SOFTWARE
SUPPORT AND FIELD SERVICE AND THE WAY IN WHICH ALL GROUPS
INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.

b.  DO YOU FEEL THE SEMINAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER?

    THE SEMINAR ON THE 10'S LASTED ONE WEEK.  THE AMOUNT OF
MATERIAL COVERED SEEMED TO BE SUFFICIENT. ALTHOUGH CLASS WAS
DISMISSED EARLY EVERYDAY (WHICH THE OPERATORS DIDNT MIND)
SOME OF THAT TIME COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO MORE USE.

c.  WHAT DID YOU GET OUT OF THE SEMINAR?

    THE SEMINAR PRESENTED MUCH INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE WERE         
UNAWARE OF. FOR EXAMPLE: DIFFERENT COMMANDS AND THIER MEANINGS,
HARDWARE CONFIGURATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING IT,
DAILY DUTIES AND AN IN DEPTH EXPLANATION OF WHY THEY ARE DONE.

d.  INCLUDE OTHER COMMENTS YOU FEEL ARE PERTINENT.

    OVER ALL, THE PDP10 SEMINAR WAS GOOD.  IT LED ME TO UNDERSTAND
THE SYSTEM BETTER AND THE ACTUAL IMPORTANCE OF MY JOB.  ALTHOUGH
THE FIRST SEMINAR DID COVER A LOT, THE INSTRUCTORS MIGHT WANT TO THINK
ABOUT SPENDING MORE TIME ON BASIC COMMANDS (ESPECIALLY THE BT COMMAND)
AND ALSO HARDWARE  CONFIGURATION.

This is the class evaluation from Rick Daniels.  It looks good.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Tymnet Training and Education schedule for the 1st quarter '88
is now available via ontyme  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL

As a result of your feedback after class and the recommendations of the
training advisory task forces we have made some changes in our
courses.

  1.  The length of  TTE 455 Utilities Code Generation has been
      increased to 8 days to provide more time for hands-on labs.

  2.  SmarTym has been added to the TTE 230 Tymnet 3270/CMT/SmarTym
      course and the length has been extended to 8 days.

  3.  The name of TTE 260 has been changed to Async Error Correction, we
      now cover X.PC, Network Server, Menu Server and 2 new
      protocols - MNP & AFT

  4.  The CPU III, MAC III and Nano engine were added to the TTE 330
      TYMNET Hardware Maintenance and Troubleshooting.

  5.  The requirement for either TTE 455 or TTE 445 as a prerequisite 
      for TTE 450 has been revised.

The enrollment procedure remains the same - use  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
In the last quarter we had some students show up who were not on our
roster.  Please be sure to send an enrollment form at least 5 weeks 
before your class.  That way we will be sure we have enough materials
and lab equipment available for you.  You should receive confirmation of
your enrollment within 2 days of your registration.

We look forward to seeing you in class next quarter.  If you have any
questions about the schedule or prerequisite courses, please give us a
call.  Our new phone number is (408) 922-7620


Sincerely,

If you "DO BACKUP" on one job, and "DO PRINT" on a different one, then ti
command "UNLOAD BACKUP:" gets "Device not available - BACKUP".  Therefore I
removed the offending line from BACKUP.MIC.  You shouldn't see the problem

The message "Bits 18,19,20 disabled cannot swap" should be interpreted as
"disk full or quota exceeded".  User UKMKTG on F26 has a quota of 5000 pages
and is currently using 5030 pages.  The easy way of checking this is to
GFD to that directory and "R QUOLST".
UKMKTG will not be able to created any new files until either
a) some old files are deleted, or
b) the logged in quota is increased and the user logs out and back in again.

     additional specific information is required by you, in order to fol-
     low up on this topic.
 
     I plan to alter your memo of yesterday and send to Japan; primarily
     so they are aware that problem has been, and is being, checked out;
     also to obtain a clarification on the dates of problem.
 
     I'll remove any sections which should not be seen by them and suggest

Carl and Dennis,    
     
At first, I'm sorry I'm not sure that you are the right person to be contacted  
on such problem. However, in my old memory, you have been the responsible  
persons for PDP-X system software. 
     
The problem on F74 reported during the middle of the last Dec and today, by
many users.    
     
And the problem is becoming very critical.   
     
So please check and advise me, or please pass this letter to appropriate person 
and let me know the name of the responsible person.    
     
The problem is 
     
        When users sent files onto F74 by BIONIC or BIONIK, the modified BIONIC 
        for KANA file input written by ex-Tymshare, they found that some   
        characters (8-12 char string) was replaced as other string.   
     
        For your checking, I located one of the troubled files onto (OGURA:74)  
        CHKDAT.NIS. (The original file in user area is (HAL:74)RHAMK2.020.)
        In that file, you can find a string "WW@@ZZ Z" at 15th column of the    
        307th record. But the original string for the 8 chars is ";  YVWYS",    
        and also we can find the "WW@@ZZ Z" at the 302nd rec in the file.  
        So I guess the 8 char string of 307th rec is overwritten by the 8 char  
        string of 302nd rec.  
     
        Anyway, our users found that the sent files on F74 were different from  
        the original files on their terminals.    
     
        The users tried to send the files through HSA in Japan. And regarding   
        the HSA, no Tymcom-370 user, who access to the host through the HSA
        slot, report such kind of problem.   
     
Thanks and regards, 
Makoto    
     
P.S. I also find some strange matter on creation date in dir information   
     of (OGURA:74)M28250.OTM. Year 1999 was indicated for the creation!!   
     I feel there is something wrong in the current F74.

Ken san,  
     
Thanks for your OnTyme regarding the matter. 
     
I understood what was happened on F74 after the last December. And it explained 
about the status on 22nd Dec 87.   
     
However, one of our user reported the problem on the file which were sent onto  
F74 at 09-Jan-88 JST. ... This is just the case which I mentioned in my last    
OnTyme.   
Also Mr.Nakano made a test file and found the problem at about 15:30 12-Jan-88  
JST by BIONIK with the test file after some trials.    
     
So I think there is still the problem on the current F74.   
     
However, we will wait and coduct the test with the test file on 16t Jan after   
the hardwere return on 15th Jan. Fotunately, 15th Jan is a national holiday in  
Japan. So we, NIS and the customers, have only 1 bussines day by the hardwere   
returning.
     
About the hardwere returnning, please let me know the scheduled time, what time 
on 15th Jan PST, and please notify the time when the returnning take place.
By that information, we may identify the cause of the problem.   
     
Regarding the BIONIK, what Carl mentioned was just correct. In near future,
no user will use the BIONIK.  
     
Best regards,  
Makoto    
P.S. See you in Tokyo the next week !!

Subject: Old base interaction problem 

I was looking at what could be "cleaned up" on some old directories and saw
the following in (TODD)BLKBAL.DOC:

I believe I've discovered the cause of the block i/o 14 sec delay.  It
turns out that the base does not indicate completion of block input
when it receives a Yellow Ball (YB) if it is "busy" at the time.  In
this case it first waits for the host to reflect an Orange Ball (OB).
When I discussed this with Ron Vavier, (the Tymnet person responsible
for mantaining the base code) another problem surfaced which may also
be affecting you.  If the OB is sent back too late (around greater than
3 sec.  after getting the YB) the base will throw it away.  This should
never happen if the monitor is reflecting the OB, but if the user is
doing it, it may happen that the time-out is exceeded either because
the system is heavily loaded or the user delays in returning the OB.  I
believe that this happens regardless of whether block mode is enabled.
Ron Vavier quotes me at least four months for solving the first
problem.  Perhaps if you were to apply pressure from your end the
development cycle could be expedited.  /Todd.


This was dated 25-Mar-81, and may have been worked on as a team of people were
given an award for solving some problem regarding block-io and MAGNUM... anyway
It is worth investigating whether any of the problems mentioned were ever fixed
or are thry still plaguing us today with the NEW base code.

I tried logging into X17 today and found it "job capacity exceeded"
went to Nicholson and found, "disk full, take corrective action" and
cty was out of paper...

I reloaded and found 2 files in (M33:17), XFER.WED was 8281 and XFER.FRI
was 4582 pages long...

It appears we are having some kind of "open-line" problem with aux-circuits
where lots of nulls are "sent"/"received" and they are filling system 17 so
it is running out of space...  there is approx 20,000 pages free on the
system at the moment... (of course, there was this much free on XMAS day
also, but the problem occurred again!)

Subject: AJ830 printer driver. 

We have an Anderson Jacobsen daisywheel printer model AJ-830 with a 
Qume Q-30 print mechanism.  I don't believe its escape sequences match
any normal Qume or Diablo printer.  I would like to have a printer driver
for it that will use the superscript and subscript features.

The escape sequences it does understand are:
 4. Reverse LF		<ESC>7
27. Superscript on	<ESC>8
28. Superscript off	<ESC>9
29. Subscript on	<ESC>9
30. Subscript off	<ESC>8
32. Partial line up	<ESC>8
33. Partial line down	<ESC>9
57. Set forms length	<ESC>C066	(for 66 lines per page)
60. Set left margin	<ESC>L
61. Set right margin	<ESC>R
62. Set top margin	<ESC>F		(sets top-of-form at current line)
66. Clear margins	<ESC>M
67. Set horiz tab	<ESC>1
68. Set vert tab	<ESC>5
69. Clear 1 horiz tab	<ESC>2
70. Clear all h tabs	<ESC>E
71. Clear 1 vert tab	<ESC>6
72. Clear all v tabs	<ESC>D

The AJ830 has a wide carriage, does 6 lines per inch only, and can be switched
from 10 to 12 characters per inch only by toggling a mechanical switch.

Is that enough information to build a semicustom printer driver?

Subject: Block I/O problem 

Joe,
  In memory of my previous patch to track down a similar problem with
block i/o, I think it would be a wise idea to install a similar check
in the monitor to verify that the base did indeed write a full/partial
block-i/o buffer and if the base skips a word somehow, do one or more
of the following:
	Issue a black-ball received on port (data lost)
	Issue a new messge type to the base to retransmit the block-i/o buffer
	Error return to the user, cause is data lossage?

I think that there should be some handshake to tell the base that we did NOT
receive the buffer when it sends a message in the ring saying it is done
writing a block-i/o buffer.

ThThe beeper went off quite a few times while Ed Hall was trying to put in

Date: 16-Jan-88 8:40ish, Contact Ed Hall, 206 697 6402.
      Actual contact, Danny King @home 713 721 4101, for system 370.
      Yes, this is Fayez sarofim...

Problem: Support in diagnosing the hardware problems, cause of system crashes
      over the past month.  FE would like some assistance.

History: Looked at the crashes on disk, CRA004-CRA008, CRA011-CRA014, CRA015.
      All but CRA015 were of the same type; in FILIO, DTASAT+4 had received
      an i/o interrupt for the disk, the PGYIO table says no i/o in progress
      so crash!

      CRA004-CRA007 were on RMA0, CRA008,CRA011,CRA012 were on RMA1, and
      CRA012-CRA014 were on RMA0.  (Danny says they had Fayez swap drives
      for a time).  CRA015 looks like a shutdown... SYSCRS/ NOCRS.

      I looked a little deeper, and tracked the CONO/DATAI info to see if
      there were any common patterns and relayed the info to Danny.  Spent
      a little over 2 hours.

Follow up:  We can look on Monday to see if there is anything else we can
      give to Danny, otherwise, hope the info already given was enough for
      him to track down the problem.

From:    Carl Baltrunas (TXS.C/Baltrunas)

Mr. Kamoi,
  As mentioned in your ONTYME regarding your test data... Could you please
up-load to the TYMCOM-X system the data multiple times, each time putting
the data into files with different filenames (such as TEST1, TEST2, etc.)
and send to me a copy of the results, so that I may examine the data files
directly.

  If you need more disk space temporarily, contact me or Jan Krivanec.

  I would also like you to try up-loading the data using the (SYS)BIONIC
program with the "KATAKANA" command.

    -R BIONIC                     << - normal ASCII mode
    *RUN
    FILE NAME: ....


    -R BIONIC                     << - normal ASCII mode
    *KATAKANA                     << - change to KATAKANA mode
    *RUN
    FILE NAME: ....

  I do not suspect that the problem is with your version of the BIONIK
program, but I wish to eliminate that possibility from my thoughts.  If
you can provide incorrect data transferred with BIONIK "and" incorrect
data transferred with (SYS)BIONIC using the KATAKANA command it may help.

  I am looking for a pattern for how the data corruption is occurring
during the data transfers and I need to be able to compare one copy of
the test data (which is known to be correct) against all copies of the
test data which transfer incorrectly.  Please make one file to keep on
disk that transfers correctly, and as many files containing bad transfer
data as you think reasonable.  The more data I can compare, the better
I will be able to find a pattern.  Please send an ONTYME with the file
names and any additional information you wish to send.

  It is 4:45 am PST now.  If you can send this information in the next 4
or 6 hours, I will look at the data when I wake up in a few hours and see
if we can find a solution.

                                Sincerely,


                                Carl A Baltrunas,  TYMCOM-X Software Support

Notice this is NOT a 4-pack system...
   also, the files are not completely up-to-date...

  I know, I was working on X32 on Friday when it was taken down... I created
a few more files than exist on this system... but only a few... and nothing
that cannot be reproduced... so, if I was the only one that lost, let's not
worry about it.

  I would like to recount my experience with logging into X32 at the time
it was being taken down...  please remind me.

Oh yes,
  there were some files that didn't have enough license on SYS on this
particular system... I fixed up XEXEC, EXECX, SUBMIT and OPER.  I would
not have noticed anything except OPER said no-password-file instead of
saying it didn't have proper license itself...  I ran CTYLOG and that
told me XEXEC died.  {sigh}

  we need a little bit of training for FSC in the data centers, so they
don't do to a live system what they've done to the test systems.

Subject: Restore of X32 files. 

I noticed that at 5pm on Friday, user RICHARDSON was logged in running TITO.
Were you doing a "STORE ALL CHANGED" just before the system went down?
Please save the hardcopy from the TITO restore.  We need to look at all the
"FILE NOT GIVEN LICENSE" messages to track down which files were not
restored properly.   /Joe

Yes, /CROSS(MON) was used.  My understanding is that the only thing that
switch does is to tell RPG to put /Q at the end of each file name in the
nnnCRE.TMP file.  I figured it would be trivial to reproduce the TMP:CRE
file if it got deleted as long as *.CRF exists.  Is this correct?  /Joe

This is a test to see if OFFICE-1 and/or SMTPX modifies the "From:" field

Subject: RDIST & tape copy 

Joe,
  When you copied things from 930/62 ==> 32 and then 32 ==> 33, 34, ...
did you copy (SYS), (SAILIB), (FTSYS), ...?

  I just remembered.... that I patched the SAIL runtimes on system 62 to
do something different than on all the other systems.  I guess I can re-think
what I did to patch it, but if the patched version is around... I'd like to
get it in a place where I can use it.

  What I patched was the remote-interrupt stuff to use frame-interrupt calls
instead.  The only program that uses intrmt (or rmtint?) is CHKPNT on device
ACT: anyway.  I doubt we'll ever rewrite it into SAIL...

I used MODE OLD NEWEST in building 32 and restoring to 33.  I would expect
that the new SAIL runtimes were restored.  X62's tapes are at Nicholsen
if not.

Re: Study of test files

Makoto,
  I have looked at the test data files on (OHTA:74)  including the new files
produced 18-Jan-88.   I have not found any particular pattern as of this
message.   I will check the logic in the BIONIC program to see how it counts
characters and records to determine if additional bytes of data are inserted
when a carriage-return or line-feed is encountered.  I do not expect any
suprises, but I cannot detect any reason why this problem can be happenning
at this time.   Both the hardware and software appear to be reliable... but
as we can see, the data is corrupted.

  Please notice that I moved the test data from (OHTA:74) to (TXSINFO:74)
because there was room for only 300 more pages in directory OHTA.  I also
copied file JAN.XT and created a file JAN.CAB which is the correct data
from JAN.XT, only in ASCII.  [I have a program which will do that very
easily, in case you have a need for someone to read a KATAKANA file on an
ASCII device, I will tell you where it is and how it works.]

------------------------

Re:  Additional tests.

  I would like you to perform two additional tests at this time.  First,
we want you to up-load the same test data that you have used on system
74 to another system.  I believe you are valid on systems 34 or 35.  If
you could make this test, we could rule out the CPU/Base hardware.

  The second test, will be to re-run the test data again on system 74
after we have put some diagnostic patches into system 74's operating
system.  If both of these tests fail, we will have to try to use the
same hardware, only change the load that is running on the system at the
time of failure.

  One last item...  how many times did you run the test in the past few
days and how many times was the data transferred successfully (if at all)
and how many times unsuccessfully.

  What hours of your working schedule overlap with pacific standard time?
It may be better if I re-arrange my schdule for a few days so that we can
overlap and work on this problem at the same time.
