     July 31, 1989

     Fellow Field Service Company Teammates:

     Early this morning we all heard the news about McDonnell Douglas'
     intention to partially divest Information Systems Company business
     units, ourselves included. 

     At the conclusion of this memo is a reprint of the press release
     which was sent out on the wire service this morning.  It will give
     you as much detail as has been published thus far.

     I'm sure that this information came as a surprise to everyone.   I
     am also quite aware that there are many unanswered questions which
     are natural during a time like this.  Let me say that right now I do
     not have all of the answers to your questions, but I commit to you
     to provide frequent progress reports as the information evolves. 

     As can be expected, to try to provide you with the "right" answer
     now would not be fair to you or to me since many of these answers
     will only come in time.  What I can tell you now, however, is DON'T

     WORRY. I'll be meeting with representatives from the Loadstar Group
     tomorrow and Wednesday, and together we plan to develop a marketing
     package for Field Service Company.  

     It is important for each of you to consider where the value for
     field service company lies.  Since we are a service company, our
     value is in our people because they are our product. 

     You all need to seriously consider your role in the company and
     understand how important you are to its future.  Although no one can
     say at this time what is going to happen, or when, the best approach
     for everyone to take is to remain a strong unit as we always have
     been and weather the approaching challenge together.

     Don't forget that we have long term contracts to maintain TYMNET and
     Computer Systems Company products.  In addition, we have a very
     strong third party maintenance contract business which is growing
     everyday.  These demonstrate a future of stability and longevity.

     In addition, MDFSCO management is exploring the possibility of a
     leverage buyout.

     Many of you have expressed concerns about your benefits and
     especially the retirement "vesting" situation.  No clear statement
     has been made on this subject as yet.  I can say that McDonnell
     Douglas Corporation is an ethical company and I am sure that they
     will deal with this matter positively and rapidly.

     Lastly, I would like to encourage each of you to sit tight for the
     time being and not make any rash assumptions.  One thing should have
     become clear over the past five years and that is that change is
     inevitable.  Who knows, this change might just be the threshold of
     the best years our company will ever know.

           REPRINT OF PRESS RELEASE 89-191, DATED JULY 31, 1989:

         ST. LOUIS, July 31, 1989 -- McDonnell Douglas Corporation today
     announced that it will sell two of its information systems
     businesses and that it intends to convert its Information Systems
     International unit into a public company headquartered in the United
     Kingdom.
         McDonnell Douglas has reached a preliminary agreement to sell
     Network Systems business, which includes the Tymnet public data
     network, to British Telecom for 355 million U.S.D..  The acquisition
     is conditional on a full due diligence and regulatory clearances.
         MDC also announced its intention to sell its North American
     field service business later this year and has retained the Lodestar
     Group to assist in the sale.  In June, MDC announced an agreement to
     sell its Telecheck business.  The annual revenues of the three
     businesses are approximately 400 million.  Gain from these three
     sales is expected to be substantial.  The proceeds will be used to
     reduce debt and make more resources available to the corporation's
     core aerospace businesses.
         Jeremy Causley, the current president of McDonnell Douglas
     Information Systems Company, will become chief executive of the
     restructured U.K. venture and make arrangements to partially divest
     it.  The present McDonnell Douglas computer Systems business in the
     U.S. will become part of the international company.  The annual
     revenues of this international business currently total about 400
     million U.S.D.
         In announcing the planned changes, MDC Chairman and Chief
     Executive Officer, John F. McDonnell, emphasized the corporation's
     increased commitment to its St. Louis based systems integration
     business.   The unit has revenues of approximately 300 million
     U.S.D..  MDC has chosen the unit as its supplier of 3-dimensional
     solids modeling for all of its computer-aided design (CAD) systems
     used in its aerospace businesses.  The MDC Systems Integration unit
     CAD/CAM/CAL systems have also been selected by such industry leaders
     as General Motors, Pratt & Whitney, Eastman Kodak, Navistar and
     AT&T.  European customers for the system include J.C.B., 3-M, and
     Moulinex.
         The Systems Integration unit will continue building its product
     usage within MDC and at the same time expand its commercial market
     share.  The U.K. based company will market the MDC Systems
     Integration products outside of North American, as the exclusive
     distributor.
         McDonnell Douglas considers the announced changes to be the last
     step in narrowing its information systems business.  For the first
     six months of 1989, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems segment
     posted revenues of 559 million U.S.D. and reported operating
     earnings of 9 million U.S.D..
         The restructuring will cause some disruption to some McDonnell
     Douglas employees as Information Systems group staff positions are
     eliminated in St. Louis and Irvine, Ca.  The corporation plans to
     place as many as possible in other positions in MDC.  The total
     won't be known until realignments are complete.
         Network Systems includes the Tymnet public data network, private
     network busines, OnTyme electronic mail services, credit card
 M  processing services, and an electronic data interchange service.
     Network Systems employs about 1,500 people and is headquartered in
     San Jose, Ca.

     PLEASE POST ON ALL BULLETIN BOARDS:


     WEEK ONE:

     In an effort to keep all employees informed on the latest news
     about Field Service Company's status and to keep the rumor mill
     to a minimum, weekly updates will be posted on Ontyme every
     Monday.  

     -    On Tuesday and Wednesday (August 1 and 2) The Lodestar Group
          interviewed MDFSCO senior management in preparation of the
          offering procedure.

     -    We told them of our substantial strengths, potential
          weaknesses and linkages with various McDonnell Douglas
          business units.

     -    We are focusing on identifying the linkages with other
          business units to maximize the value of Field Service
          Company and to continue the relationships with them.

          This is key to McDonnell Douglas' establishing a price for
          which they would offer the company to MDFSCO management or
          to any other prospective buyer.

     -    We are now waiting for Lodestar Group to prepare the
          offering brochure.  They expect to have it completed by the
          first of September.  WE ARE IN A HOLDING PATTERN UNTIL THAT
          TIME.

          MDFSCO management will continue to explore the possibility
          of a leverage buyout.

     -    If you hear any rumors, do not take them seriously.  This
          weekly communique should be your resource for accurate and
          timely information.  

     -    The vesting issue is continuing to be studied and an answer
          is imminent.

     -    If you have SPECIFIC questions, don't hesitate to send them
          in and I will answer them all as best I can.  It is critical
          for us to keep the communications open and I will do my
          part.

     WEEK TWO: - August 14


                        BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE


     Many of you have responded to my update from last week and have
     sent in specific questions.  Below are answers to questions I've
     received thus far:

     Q:  If we are sold will we continue to be covered by General
         American?

     A:  Unknown at this time.

     Q:  If you are currently under medical care will our new
         insurance company cover these expenses or will we have to
         requalify with a new company?

     A:  Generally, when new insurance groups take over, the new
         policy covers pre-existing medical conditions for existing
         employees.  This is negotiated by the company
         representatives.  There is no guarantee, however, that this
         will be the case for us.  We must wait to see who buys us.

     Q:  Is Field Service Company for sale to the end of the year
         only or until sold?

     A:  Until Sold.

     Q:  Where should software distribution be: CSC or FSCO?

     A:  Presently planned to be in FSCO.  We are going to continue
         to do software support for CSC in FSCO.

     Q:  If you were going through the process of an upgrade or
         transfer within FSCO, is it still being processed?

     A:  Yes, if it is within Field Service.

     Q:  Can we still become a member of the credit union?

     A:  Yes.

     Q:  Is Bert staying or leaving?

     A:  Staying.

     Q:  Have we lost any contracts due to this announcement?

     A:  No.  In fact we signed a contract with Sanyo ICON last week
         to become their exclusive nationwide service provider.  This
         is a very promising venture for Field Service.

     Q:  Is there a freeze on hiring?

     A:  No.

     Q:  When Network Systems Company was sold was there the same
         type of announcement?  In other words, were they told in
         advance?

     A:  No.

     Q:  What is our relationship with Network Systems Company now?

     A:  There is no change.  We signed an agreement with British
         Telecom to provide service for a minimum of three years with
         price escalations tied to some mutually agreed upon price
         index.

     Q:  What about the International shipments?

     A:  Don't know at this time.

     Q:  If we are sold prior to the vesting date, will McDonnell
         Douglas adjust the date and vest us?

     A:  No.

     Q:  Do we presently have contracts with McDonnell Douglas for
         servicing their systems?  If so, will they expire?

     A:  Yes we do.  It will be business as usual.  We are
         negotiating with MDC to get longer term agreements because
         it adds value to Field Service.

     Q:  What about the bonus?

     A:  Yes, it will be paid; The amount will be pro-rated based
         upon the date MDC sells us, but whatever performance
         earnings exist at that time, will be paid.

     Q:  How about the Redhill facility?  Will the building be sold
         along with us?

     A:  The building belongs to MDC at the present time and is not
         owned by Field Service.  We intend to try to negotiate a
         longer term lease with MDC.
                                    -more-

     Q:  How will the savings plan be handled?

     A:  Employees who have  in the savings plan at the time of
         the sale of MDFSCO will be fully vested in THAT plan. 

     Q:  What is Lodestar Group?

     A:  They are a boutique investment banking firm comprised of
         people who spun-out of Merril-Lynch investment bankers who
         specialize in consulting for acquisitions and divestitures
         of companies in niche markets.

     Q:  If the company sells while we are on vacation will we still
         have a job to come back to?

     A:  Yes.

     Q:  Will inter-component transfers open up after the sale?  And
         if so, will we retain all seniority?

     A:  No.  Only after one year could you hire back into MDC.
         Their policy is that in this case, employees retain
         seniority toward retirement points but re-set vacation days.

     Q:  Will we continue to provide service to McDonnell Douglas
         systems?

     A:  Yes.

     Q:  Is the rumor true that CSC manufacturing is on notice and
         will be shut down?

     A:  Jerry Causley addressed all CSC employees this week
         personally.  He did not indicate that any changes were
         coming.  He encouraged employees to keep going and that his
         plan would unfold over the next few months.  No mention of
         downsizing was made; however, he pointed out that MDCSC
         would have to be profitable.

     Q:  What is a leverage buy-out?

     A:  A group of internal investors (like our management team)
         line up outside equity bank-debt lenders to generate funds
         to buy the company.  The "leverage" is this use of the
         company business or cash flow assets to secure the debt.  If
         the ratios are right and the investors believe it is good
         and that they will recover their investment plus a
         significant return, they will make the loans.

     WEEK THREE: - AUGUST 21, 1989

                     BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE

     Q:   Over the years, we of MDFSCO have been allowed to accrue
          vacation time equal to double our annual entitlement.
          When MDFSCO is sold will the company pay off these accrued
          hours as was reportedly done when Health was sold?

     A:   This will depend upon the terms of the sale.  One thing is
          certain...vacation accrual belongs to the employee and you
          can't lose it.

     Q:   I am in the process of relocating to the Pittsburgh area.
          If I move to Pittsburgh, sell my house in Harrisburg and
          buy a house in Pittsburgh, will I have a job where I can
          pay the mortgage?  What is the possibility of my job going
          away?

     A:   MDFSCO management would not ask you to move at this time
          unless it was a good business decision.   They have made
          the best decision at this time with the information that
          they have.  However, we will not know the specifics until
          after the buyout. 

     Q:   If I am attending school while MDFSCO is sold, will
          McDonnell Douglas still reimburse me for that semester?

     A:   We do not anticipate any problems in this area, but again,
          it depends upon where the obligation winds up after the
          buyout.  Of course, the obligation would only apply to a
          class already begun when the buyout takes place.

     Q:   What happens to our vacation time if not taken prior to
          the sale?  Will be lose our accrued time or will new the
          company let us carry it over, or will MDC pay us for the
          unused time?

     A:   No, you will not lose your vacation time...whether paid
          upon the acquisition depends upon the negotiated terms.

     Q:   Who owns the Santa Ana facility?

     A:   McDonnell Douglas Reality Company.
                                     

                                     -more-



     Page 2

     Q:   Will spare parts be available?

     A:   CSC and Tymnet spares are available and agreements have
          been reached to keep it that way.  For the remainder of
          the spares, we will purchase them through normal channels.

     Q:   What is going to happen to M&E contracts?

     A:   We have negotiated a maintenance agreement for a period of
          several years to continue to maintain their equipment.
                                   
     Q:   Who buys third party maintenance companies?

     A:   Companies in the business world who want to expand their
          service force such as Sorbus, TRW, Control Data, and
          companies who manufacture products who need a service
          group to service their products.

     Q:   Will we still be considered a self-maintenance provider
          for MDC internal with Sun Micro Systems?

     A:   We are negotiating with MDC and Sun in order to continue
          to do the MDC maintenance.

     Q:   On maternity leave, if an employee goes out on maternity
          leave while still an MDC employee but is scheduled to
          return to work after the "sale" takes place, will the
          disability coverage continue as scheduled?  Who will the
          employee be working for...MDC or the new company?

     A:   At this point, we do not have an answer to this question.

     WEEK FOUR:  -  AUGUST 28, 1989

     Q:   Would the retirement fund come from McDonnell Douglas or roll over to
          the new company...or would it be paid in a lump sum?

     A:   Money that is invested as part of an individual retirement account
          (401K) plan belongs to employees and must be, by IRS laws,
          re-invested in a qualified instrument within ninety days, or
          penalties and taxes are due to the IRS.  Retirement plans are not
          transferrable from one company to another.  At the present time there
          are many different employee plans and specific information will be
          forthcoming on the various plans as they unfold.

     Q:   If upper management can purchase MDFSCO, will an employee retain
          service years in regard to vacation and savings plan participation
          and will an employee be able to purchase a piece of the "pie"?

     A:   We don't know.  It depends upon McDonnell Douglas.  They may choose
          to cash out all employees on unused vacation, at which time, the new
          company would have to begin accruing vacation anew.  As stated last
          week, however, employees vacation "earnings" belong to them, and they
          won't get lost.

          The only way to allow employees to purchase an equity position in the
          company would be to have a public offering, which is unlikely on Day
          One.  The reason being that without a public offering, the employees
          (person) would have to qualify as a "sophisticated investor" to
          invest at the beginning of the formation of the company.  This is a
          ruling by the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) and is there for
          the protection of the "unsophisticated investor."

     Q:   When is the exact date of vesture in the McDonnell Douglas pension
          plan?

     A:   November 27, 1989.

     Q:   I am going to be at MDFSCO five years in August, 1989.  Will I still
          get my three weeks of vacation and vesting?  Will this be decided
          when we are sold?

     A:   We don't know...this depends upon whether it can be carried over,
          contingent on the conditions of the sale.

     Q:   What will happen to the Runzheimer plan for reimbursement when MDFSCO
          is sold?  Will we continue under the plan or will alternatives be
          offered?

     A:   We do not know at this time.

                   GENERAL UPDATE:

          We have provided all of the information required by Lodestar on the
          company and they are nearing the end of preparation of the "offering"
          brochure.  Lodestar is preparing to meet with John McDonnell next
          week to establish the valuation range for the company.  John
          McDonnell will then make a determination on the value that he would
          like to receive for the company, and that will then be conveyed to
          me.  

          We have established contacts with numerous investment bankers and
          venture capitalists, and are confident that a management buyout can
          be accomplished, given Lodestar arrives at a realistic evaluation.
          The anticipated time to close the deal is expected to be around the
          end of 1989.

     WEEK FIVE: - September 5, 1989

                            BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE


     Q:   I am very concerned about my retirement benefits, particularly in
          regard to the medical health care.  I want to work as long as I can
          and put in for retirement at the last possible moment before my
          business unit is actually taken over by another company.  At what
          point in time can I do that?

     A:   An employee who is eligible to retire (age 55 and 10 years of
          Credited service) can make his/her decision to retire on the last day
          prior to the divestiture.  A delay in making that decision may cause
          delay in the receipt of the first month's retirement check.  As with
          other divestitures, we will work with you to assure all items
          necessary to facilitate the retirements will be in order.

     Q:   I am concerned that the sale of the business unit will be announced
          and I will not be able to put in for retirement under the ERIP of
          MDISC.  Will there be a window of time from the time the sale is
          announced and the time I can still retire under MDISC?

     A:   See above response.

     Q:   If another company buys MDFSCO, how soon is the retirement package
          void?  If I am age 55+ and vested, will I have 30 days after
          announcement to make decision or must I apply now?

     A:   If you are vested you have a non-forfeitable right to receive the
          benefit you have earned under the Plan.  The "retirement package"
          cannot be voided.  To leave the payroll as a retiree you must apply
          for retirement prior to termination.

     Q:   If a person is age 54 now, but will be 55 and vested in 1990, can
          he/she write a letter of intent to retire now, with the company
          honoring it if sold within 12 months?

     A:   No.  The employee must be 55 and have at least 10 years of Credited
          Service as of the divestiture date to retire under the terms of the
          Pension Plan.

     Q:   I have been with the company seven years.  MDISC ERIP is going to 5
          year vesting on 11-17-89.  What happens if my business unit is sold
          in October?  Am I not vested on 11-17-89?  Do I begin again?

     A:   To clarify the question first, MDISC ERIP is going to 5-year cliff
          vesting on 27 November 1989, not 17 November.  In either case, the
          vesting of the ERIP will be a matter of discussion during
          negotiations between buyer and MDC.

     Q:   What happens to my money in the Savings Plan when the business unit
          is sold?  Will my money in the 401K be distributed to me?

     A:   After the appropriate documentation has been filled out by the
          employee (regarding tax withholding), the money in the Savings Plan
          (401K and after-tax) will be distributed to the employee.

     Q:   If my Savings Plan monies are distributed to me, is this considered a
          lump sum distribution?  Can I therefore roll the taxable portion over
          into an IRA or other tax deferred vehicle?  What about paying taxes
          on it?

     A:   If your distribution is tied to the divestiture and you are an
          employee on that date, your distribution will be considered a lump
          sum distribution and eligible for rollover.  If you roll that
          distribution into a qualified tax deferred vehicle within 60 days of
          date of that distribution, you will not be taxed on that until it is
          distributed from that account.

     Q:   I read somewhere that when a company buys out another, the assets in
          the Savings  Plan can be taken over and the money used by the new
          owners for any expenditure.  Is that true?

     A:   We do not allow any Plan to Plan transfer in our Savings Plan.  At
          this time your money will be distributed to you.  Also, I am not
          aware of any case where another company can use your savings
          contributions for any expenditures.

     Q:   Will I receive the company matching funds in which I am vested?  What
          about the non-vest funds?  Due to the circumstances, will I be vested
          in those?

     A:   If you are an employee on the date of the divestiture and your
          termination is due to that divestiture or retirement, all company
          contributions will be vested and therefore distributed to you.

     Q:   Since the MDC Travel Company has provided poor corporate service and
          even worse personal service to employees, will we be contracting with
          a new travel agency after divestiture?

     A:   Yes.

          COMMENT:

          We will have a "firm" number by Tuesday, September 4, 1989 from
          Lodestar and we will then be working with our financial backers to
          respond to John McDonnell's offer.  Because of the confidentiality
          commitments, we cannot make the number public at this time.  Field
          Service has until mid-September to respond to McDonnell Douglas with
          an offer.

     WEEK SIX:  -  September 11, 1989

                           BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE



     Q:       How will the pre-tax plan for child care be affected?
              Will it continue to the end of 1989 or will it end on the
              date of the sale of MDFSCO?

     A:       This benefit will terminate when the sale occurs; however,
              until the sale occurs (or the year ends - whichever comes
              first), you can continue with the plan as is.  It will
              stay in effect until the end of the year, then
              participants will be instructed on what to do.

     Q:       If employees have purchased merchandise such as desk top
              computers or merchandise from the Huntington Beach MDC
              store (on credit) and a balance remains open after the
              sale of MDFSCO, will they have to pay the entire amount on
              that date?  Can the credit balance be extended for payment
              on time?

     A:       There are two possibilities here:

              Because those are loans to employees, the new company
              might choose to assume that liability as part of the
              conditions of the sale, and allow them to continue to pay
              on the plan,  or

              The employees may be asked to pay back the full amount
              upon divestiture.  Again, this decision will not be known
              until the sale is complete and all of these terms can be
              negotiated.

     Q:       Again, regarding the 27 November '89 vesting of the ERIP,
              we know it is a matter to be discussed, but what are
              Bert's feelings/intentions?  If MDC accepts the offer from
              senior management, is senior management willing to hold
              out for an effective date or other means to protect the
              vesting benefits earned by employees with five to ten
              years?  I have no idea what percentage of the employees
              falls into this category, but in any case, as the
              employees are a service company's most important asset, it
              would seem worth the effort to protect this benefit for
              these employees.

     A:       Given the complications of "doing" a deal of this
              magnitude, it is extremely unlikely that the transaction
              will be completed prior to December 22, 1989.  The
              management team, with the discussions we have had with 
                                   -more-


     Page 2

              various financing sources, believes we are the only ones
              who could close the transaction prior to the end of the
              year.  And as we stated in previous briefs, employees who
              have been with the company five full years on November 27,
              1989, will fully vest at that time.  


     COMMENT:


     We are continuing to have discussions and are trying to structure a
     transaction that would be valuable to McDonnell Douglas.  The
     transactions are very complicated; disclosing more detailed
     information would not be helpful to the process at this time.  As 

     soon as I have more tangible information, it is my intention to
     keep everyone informed on what is going on.  

     At this time, I want to reiterate a point that was made in my first
     Update.  Our company is structured on the goodwill of our customers
     and is unique in that the assets of Field Service Company are its
     people...[who go home at the end of their work day.]  Without the
     efforts of every employee to promote goodwill with our customers,
     and performing a superior job versus that of our competitors, the
     company has little value.

     COMMENT:

     An offer for the company was submitted on Friday, September 15,
     1989, to McDonnell Douglas.  They have evaluated our offer and we
     have received a favorable response.

     McDonnell Douglas now must evaluate the offer in detail in
     regards to terms and conditions of the offer, which will be done
     during this week.

     This by no means is saying that the purchase is a done deal,
     however.  McDonnell Douglas will evaluate the proposal during
     this week and we will know more by next week.  Employees should
     be aware that some negotiations will be required to consummate a
     purchase, and these negotiations may be time consuming.

     I feel very upbeat about the situation and very positive that a
     transaction can be reached.

     WEEK EIGHT: - SEPTEMBER 25, 1989

                     BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE


     Q:       If we already have scheduled vacations after the 26th of
              December, is it going to be cancelled or do we go ahead with
              already made plans/time off?

     A:       You should plan your vacation as business as usual as the company
              is going to continue to operate.  If employees have vacation
              scheduled, they should feel free to take them under normal
              schedules.

     COMMENT:

              Last week we introduced the funding sources to McDonnell Douglas
              for them to verify the seriousness of our offer and the financial
              strength of the backers.  I believe that the McDonnell Douglas
              investment broker, Lodestar, satisfied themselves that funding
              would be available at closing.  This week we expect McDonnell
              Douglas to complete their evaluation of the offer and to inform
              us as to their determination.

    WEEK NINE:  - OCTOBER 2, 1989

                          BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE

    COMMENT:

    I apologize for the delay in this week's message.  Due to the
    volume and content of the questions sent in this week, as well as
    several customer visits at headquarters, responding in a
    comprehensive manner has taken longer .

    Regarding our offer to McDonnell Douglas...Last Monday they
    requested a ten-day extension to evaluate the offer.
    Simultaneously, we have put additional financing representation
    in front of MDC to give them assurances that funding would be
    available upon closing.  I anticipate that within the next five
    days we will either conclude the arrangements with MDC or
    terminate them, at which time the company will be placed in
    auction. 

    We are enthusiastic that McDonnell Douglas will recognize that
    our offer is both in the best interest for them, for the
    employees and the customers.

                                 . . . . 


    Q:    If any employee elects not to go with the new service
          company, will that employee be entitled to severance pay
          from McDonnell Douglas?

    A:    Once again, this would depend upon the specific
          circumstances, but it would most likely be considered a
          voluntary termination at that time and no severance pay
          is given on voluntary terminations.

                                 -more-

    Q:    There is a concern that a person's tenure with McDonnell
          Douglas will be reset to zero after the leverage buyout
          goes through.  What is the strategy to deal with this
          benefit?

    A:    Presently the tenure question is being reviewed.  I
          anticipate that service with McDonnell Douglas would be
          counted towards vacation under the new company.  But, as
          far as tenure towards any other benefit plan, that would be
          part of the negotiations with MDC and is unknown at the
          present time.

    Q:    Since the Federal Government required a company to choose
          between a five-year vesting and a seven-year vesting plan
          on January l, 1989, why did McDonnell Douglas choose to
          delay the plan of their choice to start on November 27,
          1989?

    A:    With a company the size of McDonnell Douglas, many factors
          had to be considered in how to respond to a government-
          mandated change in vesting.  McDonnell Douglas chose the
          November 27 date in view of all the factors so that they
          could consider what was best for the employees and for
          McDonnell Douglas.

    Q:    When the new company buys Field Service, will they change
          vesting plans?  If so, what effect will this have on Field
          Service employees?

    A:    Please refer to tenure question above; the situation is the
          same for vesting.
                           
    Q:    How will the new McDonnell Douglas "company invested" funds
          plan (which starts November 26, 1989 following an
          employee's five-year 100% vesting) affect current McDonnell
          Douglas Field Service Employees if the company sells
          (before or after November 26?)

    A:    The company will not be sold prior to November 26 given the
          amount of documentation that must be compiled.  In any
          case, upon the sale of MDFSCO, all "company matching
          invested" funds will be vested to the employees on
          divestiture.

    Q:    It has been reported in a national magazine that nine out
          of ten leveraged buyouts fail.  Aside from the challenge of
          beating the odds and the pride in building a company as
          FSCO exists today, if the success of such a venture is so
          difficult, why does Bert want to do it?

                                   -more-

    Page 3

          One of the reasons given for the failings has to do with
          the significantly higher costs of achieving the leveraged
          buyout (interest, debt expense, etc.)  In addition to
          looking at other sources of revenue, what is being done to
          be sure that FSCO is the one out of ten that succeeds?

    A:    Because I sincerely believe we can make it work.  I have
          faith in the people and the product niches we're in today.
          I am very proud of what we have achieved and believe that
          we can make a difference in this marketplace.  My analysis
          of companies that have failed is that they have entered
          into the transaction over-leveraged on debt and have not
          aggressively pursued the marketplaces they are in.

    Q:    Will any and all employees who are affected by these
          cuts/changes in compensation be notified prior to the
          consummation of the sale?  Compensation as used here refers
          to payroll, benefits, car plan, business expenses on
          company trips, etc.

    A:    Once the company is sold, issues involving payroll
          benefits, car plans, etc. will be communicated to the
          employees.  However, at this time I anticipate no changes
          to the present system.  The above reference that business
          expenses on company trips are considered as compensation
          troubles me.  Expense reports are for reimbursing
          out-of-pocket expenses on company-related business only,
          and should not be considered as compensation or as a
          benefit.  For those of us who travel frequently, we
          recognize that travelling on company business is not the
          glamorous activity some would imagine.

    Q:    When the sale is complete (whether by the management team
          or an outside concern), will the company have an equal say
          in product design or development (as far as serviceability
          is concerned ) with MDCSC as ADP has?

    A:    We intend to maintain a voice in the development and design
          of MDCSC and Tymnet products.  However, this may not always
          be possible and will ultimately affect our price for
          service.  Whenever possible, we will use our expertise in
          service consulting to assist both our partners and
          ourselves in remaining competitive in this marketplace.
          This may not always be possible with such companies as DEC,
          particularly in some of the niche relationships which we
          intend to develop where this would be possible and highly
          desirable.

    Q:    One of the reasons that the no-interest loan program for
          computer systems to an employee was so that an employee
          could purchase a computer with only 20% of the necessary
          funds.  Bert's answer previously regarding the settlement
          of this loan was speculative, probably as it should be.
          However, if I were to participate in the loan program
          within the next month, I would not have the necessary cash
          to settle the debt upon the sale of the company.  Has an
          alternative been identified as yet to the lump sum cash
          settlement?  Is the settlement of this debt part of Bert's
          offer?

    A:    It is not a part of the offer and we have no idea how many
          MDFSCO employees are participation.  Employee no-interest
          loans will not be part of our offer and we do not plan to
          assume loan liability for employees.  Unless you are
          confident that you could pay full value of purchases on the
          no-interest loan program, I advise that purchases not be
          made at this time.

    Q:    Realizing the initial difficulties encountered with DEC and
          other primary equipment vendors when FSCO picked up service
          on the equipment, and without the "McDonnell Douglas"
          company name, will we still have leverage to pick up other
          equipment maintenance?  If so, How?

    A:    There is no evidence that the McDonnell Douglas name has
          had any effect upon our ability to acquire service
          business.  The reputation of our service, however, has had
          significant leverage in acquiring relationships for the
          service of other manufacturers products.  For instance, we
          have just signed maintenance agreements with Sanyo Icon
          (the day after the sale of MDFSCO was announced) and
          another with CRC (Computer Remarketing Corporation) a month
          later.  Both contracts are in new areas of service for us
          and the revenue potentials are enormous.   Each contract
          was signed with the knowledge that our McDonnell Douglas
          affiliation was going away.  These types of contracts are
          indicative of our strength as a company regardless of our
          name.

    Q:    Most of the contracts we have read about provide for up to
          a three-year commitment.  What real quality improvements
          are being made to assure contract renewals?  We have seen
          parts shortages (unavailability of parts, keeping the
          customer down, such as for disc drives); the PM ribbon
          program does not change nor improve the PM procedure, only
          the perception that one has been done; what Real
          improvements have been done or are underway that the field
          may not know about or will be implementing?
                                    -more-

    Page 5

    A:    We continue to improve the use and the understanding of our
          AIMS system.  This should improve the availability of parts
          and reduce some of the recent shortages.  We continue to
          add to our inventory when shortages have been encounters.
          In the next few weeks, a training video on the AIMS program
          will be provided to people who handle parts to provide
          faster, more in-depth training where it is needed. And, we
          have plans to significantly improve the discipline of how
          our people handle spare parts. 

          With our recent PM program we now know that our focus has
          improved the perception of the value by the customer.  Also
          because of this focus we found that in fact, the field was
          not performing PM's and that our surveys indicated
          legitimate complaints.  

          It is all of our responsibility to convey to the customer
          the value of the service they are receiving.  In those
          cases where we were performing a PM and not informing
          customers, we were doing ourselves a great disservice.
          Initially our management believed that it was just a
          perception of the customer that PM's were not being
          performed; but, on closer evaluation, we found that we were
          temporarily misinformed.

    Q:    Will any questions asked by any individual (including
          myself) that results in an effective "unknown at this time"
          response be answered in the future, prior to the
          consummation of the deal?

    A:    Yes, we have held all of the unanswered questions in queue
          and plan to answer them fully when the answers are known.

    Q:    Some of the "older" Microdata people remember a nine-years+
          1000 hours for vesture, as opposed to the full ten years.
          Is this still a current policy?  If this period of time
          were completed between July 31 and November 26, would the
          vesture be honored?

    A:    Your question is irrelevant since all employees on-board
          for five full years will fully vest on November 26, 1989,
          and we don't anticipate our offer (or any others) to be
          concluded by that date.  Obviously, any time over five
          years will have no impact on the vesting situation except
          that the balance in the fund will be greater for those
          who've participated longer.

     PLEASE POST ON ALL BULLETIN BOARDS:

     WEEK ELEVEN:  -  OCTOBER 16, 1989

                  BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE


     Q:  There are rumors of a large Reduction in Force about to
         occur, but they haven't been clear on whether the cuts will
         occur in CSC or FSCO.  Are these cuts going to happen within
         FSCO?

     A:  As stated in several of my previous updates, a reduction in
         force for FSCO is not anticipated as long as the integrity
         of our customer base remains strong.  In mid-September, CSC
         laid off approximately 70 people from the Manufacturing
         group.  What their future plans in this regard is not known
         by me and I can't speculate on rumors.



     Q:  Was the presentation of additional financing representation
         made to McDonnell Douglas at their request or urging?

     A:  Yes.

     Q:  Should the offer be rejected by McDonnell Douglas, what is
         meant by "placed in auction?"  Does this mean there are no
         other interested parties at this time and McDonnell Douglas
         will auction us to recoup some of its investment, not
         necessarily to a party interested in the longevity and
         success of the company?

     A:  The reference "placed in auction" means that should the FSCO
         leverage buyout offer be denied, McDonnell Douglas intends
         to then offer us for sale on the open market to the highest
         bidder, in a manner consistent with what is best for the
         stock holders and the MDC employees.  Note:  Until MDC says
         No to our offer, we remain the only bidder for the company.

     Q:  Will the people participating in the PC Loan Program be able
         to repay the loan directly from non-deferred savings after
         the vesting date?  What about deferred savings?



     A:  Non-deferred savings can be used for whatever the individual
         chooses.   How McDonnell Douglas elects to reimburse this
         money and whether they would be willing to deduct monies
         owed on a PC Loan Program from savings is not known at this
         time.   Deferred savings can also be used as the individual
         sees fit, however, it should be remembered that taxes must
         be paid to the IRS on the deferred income at some point and
         it may be advisable for you to contact your tax consultant.



     COMMENT:

     We continue to discuss the offer and for McDonnell Douglas to
     gain a better understanding of it.

     WEEK TWELVE:  OCTOBER 23, 1989

                    BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE


     Q:   How is Field Service Company doing as far as our
          performance earnings?  Haven't heard anything since first
          quarter.

     A:   The company is doing well through the third quarter and is
          ahead of plan.  As of third quarter 1989, we have earned
          five days PSP against a plan of three days for that
          period.  

     Q:   Where will spares and parts come from after Field Service
          Company is no longer affiliated with McDonnell Douglas?

     A:   We will obtain our spares from the OEM's (original
          equipment manufacturers) just the same as we always have.

     Q:   I am expecting a child sometime after the first of the
          year.  How will the upcoming changes affect medical
          coverage?  How can I keep my current coverage until after
          the birth of my child?

     A:   Again, this is a difficult question to answer at this time
          because there are so many unknowns.  It is safe to tell
          you that usually when a company goes into a new insurance
          plan the insurers assume total responsibility for all
          current and pre-existing medical conditions.   Therefore,
          in your case, your wife and child's birth should be
          covered.

     COMMENT:

     We are expecting a document from McDonnell Douglas by Tuesday
     (October 31, 1989) which will be a Letter of Acceptance of our
     offer.  This does not mean that the LBO is a "done deal," but
     takes us to the next step in our negotiations.  Now both
     parties must work together toward final conclusion of the
     complicated negotiation.

              BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE


     Q:    If an employee meets all of the qualifications (age, vesting, etc.)
           and takes early retirement from McDonnell Douglas prior to the
           establishment of the new FSCO, will they be offered a job with the
           new company?  Also, will these individuals maintain their seniority
           (vacation accrual) at the same level with the new company?

     A:    If employees approach FSCO after retiring from McDonnell Douglas and
           their job is still open in the new company, they will be considered
           for their old job.  They will not carry forward vacation, however,
           and will be considered a "new" employee at that time.

              BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE


     Q:       It has been quite a long time since I've seen the
              JOBLINE listings that described openings in FSCO, as
              well as CSC throughout the United States.  Will it
              be published and distributed again the the future?

     A:       As you know, both CSC and FSCO are going through
              changes, prompting the temporary discontinuance of
              JOBLINE.  Once the buyout concludes, there are a
              number of Human Relations programs that we will be
              adding.

       Page 2


     Q:       Some FSCO personnel are due to receive a second half
              of their raise effective in late December.  How will
              these be handled?  Has the money already been
              allocated?

     A:       If your planned increase is due in December, there
              are no current plans to change the compensation
              program at this time.

     Q:       Do you foresee any changes in the education benefits
              for employees?  If so, what are they?

     A:       Yes, we do expect changes to occur in employee
              benefits once the buyout  is completed.  At this
              time I do not have any specific details to share
              with you because we are still conducting the
              research phase of the entire benefits package.  

     Q:       In the Spring of 1991, with the company's continued
              financial support, I will receive a BBA Degree.
              What career paths are open to me if I were willing
              to accept a transfer to anywhere except Southern
              California?   

     Page 3


     A:       I'm not certain that employee educational benefits
              will be one of those offered by the new company.
              Again, these details are not formalized as yet.  In
              reference to your question about taking a transfer,
              my response is that it depends upon whether there is
              an open requisition in a job for which you are
              qualified at the time and the dynamics of the
              department and company at that time.  I would like
              to say yes, but Spring 1991 is a long time away.

     WEEK SIXTEEN - NOVEMBER 20, 1989

               BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE


     Q:   My husband recently went to the dentist (under the Sanus
          plan) and was told that he will need extensive work done
          on his teeth which will take about eight to ten visits.
          Assuming that we will finalize our sale within the next
          couple of months, I am sure he will not have enough time
          to get in all of these visits.  I called Sanus and was
          told that I should check with my own company about
          continuing our dental coverage, perhaps under a COBRA
          plan.  Do you have any information about the COBRA plan
          or other information about how we will continue some
          type of dental coverage?

     A:   McDonnell Douglas does have a COBRA policy that applies
          to dental (and medical) insurance coverage.  To get
          specific answers to your question, please contact the
          MDC Group Insurance Office in St. Louis at 314/233-6021
          and ask to speak to Sharon.

     Q:   Are we going to have the same health coverage for 1990,
          and if so, will the rates change?

     A:   As has been stated in several previous weekly updates,
          our current health coverage is going to change when we
          divest from MDC.  I assume that our rates will also be
          different, but at this time I have no specific
          information on the finer details.  We plan to provide
          all employees with comprehensive information on all of
          these types of questions when the specifics are
          finalized.


     Q:   I'd like to carry over some vacation time to next year,
          will vacation time be carried over?

     A:   Yes, for full-time employees, earned vacation time will
          be carried over into the new company.

     Q:       Who owns AIMS?  Will the purchase of FSCO include the
              hardware and software rights to use AIMS and the
              associated packages (RCR, CCI, etc.?)  Also, what of
              office software, LOTUS and MM for instance, are both
              licensed for use to the McDonnell Douglas
              Corporation?

     A:       Field Service Company owns the AIMS software program,
              and we have the rights to all of the hardware and
              software utilized in the company today.  These rights
              are considered assets of FSCO.  LOTUS and MultiMate
              are individual software packages available to
              everyone and the license fee is paid for at the time
              the software package is purchased.  

     Q:       If the new FSCO won't own the hardware/software
              rights, what type of new system will be used?  Should
              we be spending time maintaining new and current parts
              or utilizing in-house software programs for component
              control without knowing if we will be working with
              compatible data bases and files?

     A:       All MIS systems are owned by FSCO.

     WEEK EIGHTEEN - DECEMBER 4, 1989

                 BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE

     Q:       On October 30 the comment was "we are expecting a
              document from MDC by October 31 which will be a
              letter of acceptance of our offer."  Every week since
              then, we have waited to see if the offer was
              accepted...has it been?  If not, can you please
              provide an update?

     A:       We have received a verbal acceptance and have been
              working with McDonnell Douglas to complete the letter
              of intent.  One cause in the delay has been the
              MDC/BTI transaction.  The FSCO offer was placed on
              hold for approximately one month in order that MDC
              could focus fully on the BTI sale.  In addition, many
              issues are in a state of transition which could have
              an effect upon the final format of the letter of
              intent.  It is unlikely at this time that we will
              complete the sale by December 31, 1989, and are
              looking at the early part of 1990.

     Q:       Will employees have an opportunity to sell back their
              earned vacation days in lieu of carrying them on the
              books with the new company?

     A:       No.  FSCO is assuming the entire employee vacation
              liability from MDC and cannot afford to cash people
              out on vacation.

     Q:       Will Cigna be an offered health care package?

     A:       Many health care options are being reviewed and the
              company which offers the best overall package will be
              selected.
                       
     Q:       What kind of plans are being put together for
              reorganization at the management levels to help
              streamline and cut what could be considered
              unnecessary overhead?

     A:       The entire management structure is being closely
              examined and some minor reorganization is anticipated
              to streamline the organization.  The new company has
                                  -more-

     Page 2

              no intention of being inefficient or tolerating
              non-performance in any area of the company.

     Q:       Can any details of the buyout be discussed at this
              time?  This is a very generic question, but, there is
              absolutely no information flow at all here at the
              field engineer level.

     A        There is no such thing as generic information in a
              buyout.  These are very complicated transactions and
              are subject to variances of market and are, I
              believe, of little concern to anyone other than the
              people who are writing the check for the company.
     Q:       Are we closing the Valley Forge facility?

     A:       British Telecom Network (BTN) is in the process of
              consolidating operations in Valley Forge, as the
              building was part of the assets in the McDonnell
              Douglas/BTN sale.

              BTN extended the offer to Field Service Company for
              us to remain in the facility, but after renovation
              and consolidation, our current space would be reduced
              by 2,700 sq. ft. with a possible rent increase.
              Further, we would also have to re-locate a portion of
              the Logistics operation out of the facility.  This
              would create significant inefficiencies for our
              operation and, therefore, the decision has been made
              to relocate the Valley Forge facility in its entirety
              by January 31, 1990.          

              Over the next two weeks we will be exploring all of
              our options for where we want to continue this very
              important operation.  When a final decision is made,
              we will inform everyone.  We will endeavor to move
              this facility with as little disruption as possible
              to the support operation.

     Q:       For several weeks we've been reading your responses
              to a variety of questions and the tempo of many
              responses indicates that the LBO has been successful
              without really saying so.  Has the LBO by FSCO
              management been a success?  For all intents and
              purposes has ownership of the FSCO changed hands, or
              are we just a heartbeat away from it?

     A:       We continue to be very enthusiastic and optimistic
              that a transaction will be completed.  But, in
              business affairs, transactions are never complete
              until money changes hands and the final documents are
              signed.  There is significant due diligence which
              must be completed for the financing which means
              talking to customers, vendors and suppliers.
                                    -more-

     Page 3

              Information from these investigations can, if
              interpreted incorrectly, have a negative impact upon
              the opinion of the financing sources of the company.
              So, to sum it all up, the old sports saying -- "The
              game isn't over till the fat lady sings."

     Q:       Has any location (geographic) been decided upon for
              the new FSCO?  Scuttlebutt says that a tentative spot
              has been chosen off the 5 Freeway in Santa Ana...is
              there any truth to that?

     A:       MDC has asked FSCO to relocate by April, 1990 out of
              the Santa Ana facility so that the space can be given
              to MDC Electronics Company.  We are looking at
              various facilities and have not chosen one at this
              time.  We have looked at a spot off of the 5 Freeway
              in Santa Ana, but, no decision has been made on this
              facility since it is much larger than our present
              needs.  Any facility that is chosen must meet a
              criterion of price and not subject us to another move
              within the near term.  Our last move to the Santa Ana
              facility was disruptive and we are not enthusiastic
              about any other disruptions to the company, for
              obvious reasons.

     July 31, 1989

     Fellow Field Service Company Teammates:

     Early this morning we all heard the news about McDonnell Douglas'
     intention to partially divest Information Systems Company business
     units, ourselves included. 

     At the conclusion of this memo is a reprint of the press release
     which was sent out on the wire service this morning.  It will give
     you as much detail as has been published thus far.

     I'm sure that this information came as a surprise to everyone.   I
     am also quite aware that there are many unanswered questions which
     are natural during a time like this.  Let me say that right now I do
     not have all of the answers to your questions, but I commit to you
     to provide frequent progress reports as the information evolves. 

     As can be expected, to try to provide you with the "right" answer
     now would not be fair to you or to me since many of these answers
     will only come in time.  What I can tell you now, however, is DON'T

     WORRY. I'll be meeting with representatives from the Loadstar Group
     tomorrow and Wednesday, and together we plan to develop a marketing
     package for Field Service Company.  

     It is important for each of you to consider where the value for
     field service company lies.  Since we are a service company, our
     value is in our people because they are our product. 

     You all need to seriously consider your role in the company and
     understand how important you are to its future.  Although no one can
     say at this time what is going to happen, or when, the best approach
     for everyone to take is to remain a strong unit as we always have
     been and weather the approaching challenge together.

     Don't forget that we have long term contracts to maintain TYMNET and
     Computer Systems Company products.  In addition, we have a very
     strong third party maintenance contract business which is growing
     everyday.  These demonstrate a future of stability and longevity.

     In addition, MDFSCO management is exploring the possibility of a
     leverage buyout.

     Many of you have expressed concerns about your benefits and
     especially the retirement "vesting" situation.  No clear statement
     has been made on this subject as yet.  I can say that McDonnell
     Douglas Corporation is an ethical company and I am sure that they
     will deal with this matter positively and rapidly.

     Lastly, I would like to encourage each of you to sit tight for the
     time being and not make any rash assumptions.  One thing should have
     become clear over the past five years and that is that change is
     inevitable.  Who knows, this change might just be the threshold of
     the best years our company will ever know.

           REPRINT OF PRESS RELEASE 89-191, DATED JULY 31, 1989:

         ST. LOUIS, July 31, 1989 -- McDonnell Douglas Corporation today
     announced that it will sell two of its information systems
     businesses and that it intends to convert its Information Systems
     International unit into a public company headquartered in the United
     Kingdom.
         McDonnell Douglas has reached a preliminary agreement to sell
     Network Systems business, which includes the Tymnet public data
     network, to British Telecom for 355 million U.S.D..  The acquisition
     is conditional on a full due diligence and regulatory clearances.
         MDC also announced its intention to sell its North American
     field service business later this year and has retained the Lodestar
     Group to assist in the sale.  In June, MDC announced an agreement to
     sell its Telecheck business.  The annual revenues of the three
     businesses are approximately 400 million.  Gain from these three
     sales is expected to be substantial.  The proceeds will be used to
     reduce debt and make more resources available to the corporation's
     core aerospace businesses.
         Jeremy Causley, the current president of McDonnell Douglas
     Information Systems Company, will become chief executive of the
     restructured U.K. venture and make arrangements to partially divest
     it.  The present McDonnell Douglas computer Systems business in the
     U.S. will become part of the international company.  The annual
     revenues of this international business currently total about 400
     million U.S.D.
         In announcing the planned changes, MDC Chairman and Chief
     Executive Officer, John F. McDonnell, emphasized the corporation's
     increased commitment to its St. Louis based systems integration
     business.   The unit has revenues of approximately 300 million
     U.S.D..  MDC has chosen the unit as its supplier of 3-dimensional
     solids modeling for all of its computer-aided design (CAD) systems
     used in its aerospace businesses.  The MDC Systems Integration unit
     CAD/CAM/CAL systems have also been selected by such industry leaders
     as General Motors, Pratt & Whitney, Eastman Kodak, Navistar and
     AT&T.  European customers for the system include J.C.B., 3-M, and
     Moulinex.
         The Systems Integration unit will continue building its product
     usage within MDC and at the same time expand its commercial market
     share.  The U.K. based company will market the MDC Systems
     Integration products outside of North American, as the exclusive
     distributor.
         McDonnell Douglas considers the announced changes to be the last
     step in narrowing its information systems business.  For the first
     six months of 1989, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems segment
     posted revenues of 559 million U.S.D. and reported operating
     earnings of 9 million U.S.D..
         The restructuring will cause some disruption to some McDonnell
     Douglas employees as Information Systems group staff positions are
     eliminated in St. Louis and Irvine, Ca.  The corporation plans to
     place as many as possible in other positions in MDC.  The total
     won't be known until realignments are complete.
         Network Systems includes the Tymnet public data network, private
     network busines, OnTyme electronic mail services, credit card
 M  processing services, and an electronic data interchange service.
     Network Systems employs about 1,500 people and is headquartered in
     San Jose, Ca.

     PLEASE POST ON ALL BULLETIN BOARDS

     WEEK NINETEEN & TWENTY - DECEMBER 18, 1989

              BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE

     Q:       Will there be mandatory drug testing with the new
              company, or any drug testing?

     A:       FSCO management continues to have a serious aversion
              to drugs of any sort in the work force, and will not
              tolerate their use where our customer's may be
              affected.

     Q:       It is generally expected that if a reduction in force
              had to occur, the 'benefits' to the employee would be
              greater under McDonnell Douglas than under the new
              company.  If there had to be a RIF, would this
              reduction occur while under MDC control?

     A:       It is unclear whether MDC will maintain the same
              layoff benefit package in the future; therefore,
              making any comparison between what MDC might do and

              what our new company will offer is unwise at the
              present.  We intend to treat all employees fairly and
              to have a competitive compensation and benefits
              package to reinforce the growth of our company. 

     Q:       You have previously stated that as long as the
              customer base remains constant, the need for a RIF
              would not exist.  Since more and more CSC equipment
              is going away and is not being replaced by new CSC
              equipment, and since CRC nor Sanyo/Icon have provided
              significant customer base, what should the employees
              expect?

     A:       We continue to get new customers in all areas of our
              business.  We expect that the CSC base will be
              revitalized during 1990 and we are also making
              significant inroads with other large customers
              through our service management activities.
      
     Q:       Why was the inactivity of the McDonnell Douglas
              research team in the buyout proposal kept secret?
              Was it really inactivity, or does the management team
              have a problem with some of the prospective creditors
              or investors?


     A:       The circumstances in this matter are, in fact, being
              kept secret and are not for public disclosure since
              they not only affect the financing of FSCO, but the
              legal filing requirements of MDC.  Items of this
              nature are intended to be confidential and are not to
              be made public.  Because some people have a desire to
              know everything there is to know about everything
              does not make it so.

     Q:       We have already heard some bits of what the new
              company benefits may or may not be, such as no
              tuition reimbursement and changes in the health
              plan.  Will we have sufficient notification of the
              total benefits package prior to the sale completion
              so that those not interested in working for such a
              company have an opportunity to seek employment
              elsewhere?

     A:       No.  You will not have notification prior to the sale
              and at the time of the sale, everyone can make a
              judgement as to where they believe their best
              interests lie.

     Q:       One of my major concerns is whether the new company
              will offer a family health plan, or employee only.
              Has this been determined yet?  Not yet need it to
              know the specific details of the options, but will
              dental and optical coverage be offered?

     A:       Our coverage will be a family health plan, including
              dental and optical.  Specifics on the complete plan
              are not available at this time.

     Q:       If the total benefits package is not put together at
              the time the sale is completed, is there a
              possibility that employees would experience a period
              of non-coverage...or will the sale be delayed until
              all such benefits are in place?

     A:       No.  Employees will not suffer non-coverage.

     Q:       Will there be a fair (to the employee) procedure
              regarding the new company car plan where engineers
              will not lose their reimbursement until their current
              four year term is up on the presently enrolled
              vehicle?  Many of us cannot afford to lose the
              monthly check for the car and insurance payments, and
              revert to XXX cents per mile.

     A:       We do not anticipate making any changes in the
              company car plan.  We recognize that the vehicles are
              an integral part of conducting business.


     Q:       Employees who have personal loans through MDC Credit
              Union on homes, cars, boats, etc. are concerned that
              they may not be allowed to continue making payments
              but will have to pay off their loans and re-finance.

     A:       Loans are independent contracts governed by state and
              federal jurisdictions.  Employees can just continue
              the relationship on these loans on an "as is" basis.

     Q:       What about the policy on divested employees regarding
              checking, credit cards and share accounts?

     A:       We are looking into these kinds of benefits for
              employees.  Our plan is not to continue the Diner's
              Club credit card plan; we are, however, investigating
              establishing a relationship with a Credit Union.

     Q:       When the sale is complete will be have to pay MDC
              back for education reimbursement, or will the new
              firm offer the same benefits as MDC?

     A:       Employees who requested education reimbursement
              through the normal channels will get paid back the
              standard rate of reimbursement if they are enrolled
              in a semester when the sale takes place.  We have, as
              yet, not decided what our educational reimbursement
              will be under the new company.

     Q:       A series of meetings was conducted in conjunction
              with the Health Systems divestiture to inform
              employees of benefits options, tax issues, etc.  Is
              there a commitment from MDC to provide the same
              service to FSCO employees?

     A:       Yes.  Human Resources plans on communicating fully
              all of their employee benefit options, closer to the
              sale finalization.

     Q:       Did we make our numbers for the year?  If so, how much
              will our PSP be and when will this be distributed?

     A:       Yes, MDFSCO achieved our PSP objective for 1989, but
              because of the timing of the reporting of financials,
              we do not have final numbers as yet.  We will know the
              amount of payout by March, 1990.

         MESSAGE FROM BERT NOVAK


     TO ALL EMPLOYEES:

     I am very pleased to announce that representatives of McDonnell
     Douglas have signed our letter of intent to purchase the FIELD
     SERVICE COMPANY on January 26, 1990.  As you know, we have been
     in negotiations for this transaction since August 1989, but at
     no time did we falter in our belief in a successful outcome.

     Furthermore, I am pleased to announce that the transaction will
     include an ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) which will
     result in employee ownership.  More information will be provided
     in the near future.

     During the next few weeks auditors from the various lending
     sources will start their due diligence to ensure that the
     representation made by us as to the conditions of the company
     are correct.  We are not finished with the process, but,
     significant progress has already been made and we lok to
     complete the purchase within sixty (60) days.

     At this important milestone, I want to thank everyone for their
     support in continuing to provide quality service to our
     customers and for your patience during this lengthy transaction.

          WEEKLY UPDATE FROM BERT NOVAK

    Q:       Is there going to be a policy in the new company about
             married couples working in the company?

    A:       Married couples as well as family members can work in
             the new company.  The only stipulation on their
             employment will be that they not report to a relative
             in the same department.

    Q:       How is the buyout going?

    A:       I am pleased to announce that we are still moving
             forward with the buyout.  During the past several weeks
             we encountered several delays resulting from unforeseen
             legal requirements, which simply means more time will
             be required to finalize the deal. 

    Q:       Have you decided on a name for the company yet?

    A:       We have been working with our advertising agency on
             developing and filing for a company name.  It is much
             harder to come up with a viable name that hasn't
             already been registered somewhere in the United States
             previously.  Many of the names we liked and tried to
             use are registered, which has been disappointing and
             time consuming.  Right now we have a name that looks
             very good and we should know in the next few weeks
             whether it is available.  As soon as the lawyer has
             cleared the name, I will announce it to everyone.

    Q:       A rumor has it that our vacation time will be lost or
             changed with the new company.  Can you comment?

    A:       Employee vacation time will not be affected in any way
             in the new company.

                              INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM





      DATE:  March 5, 1990

      TO:    All Field Service Company Employees

      FROM:  Bert Novak

      SUBJECT:    PSP


      *********************************************************************

                          CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU!

      MDFSCO  employees  are  special.  For the past two years you have been
      part  of  that very select group of MDISC companies that achieved 200%
      of  its  PSP  goal.    As  a  group  you  have  excelled  in  a tough,
      unforgiving  industry  - not once, but twice!  Your achievement can be
      compared  to  that  of  the  S.F.  49ers and the L.A. Lakers. You too,
      through  diligence,  perseverance  and  professionalism,  have  pulled
      together  as  a team to stand head and shoulders above the rest - Back
      To Back Championships!  
      Thanks  to  this fine performance during 1989, we achieved our Planned
      Performance  Earnings;    the  PSP award checks will be distributed to
      eligible employees this week.

      Eligibility rules are as follows:

      1.     Your MDFSCO Hire Date must be on or before July 1, 1989.

      2.     Employees  with less than 12 months (2080 hours) will receive a
             prorated award.

      3.     If  you  transferred  from  another  MDISC business unit during
             1989,  you  will receive a prorated share of that company's PSP
             award and a prorated share of MDFSCO's award.

      4.     MDC  employment  must  have  been  continuous,  with at least 6
             months in MDISC.

      5.     You must be on the payroll at the time of the payout.

      As  you  all know, we have been working diligently on getting the sale
      of  Field  Service  Company  finalized.  Although a great deal of time
      and  effort  has been extended toward the process, we are still not in
      a  position  to  close the deal.  At this point, the investor group is
      conducting  the  "due  diligence" phase of the transaction.  This is a
      very   detailed,   yet   extremely   important   step  which  must  be
      satisfactorily completed prior to the culmination of the transaction.


      We  are  certainly  as  eager as you are to finalize the arrangements.
      As  soon as official announcements can be made, I will let you know of
      the outcome.

      In  the  meantime, important progress has been made in other areas.  I
      am  pleased  to  announce  that  we  have  been successful in securing
      insurance  benefit  plans  and premium costs which are very similar to
      those  which  have  been  available through MDC.  This is particularly
      good  news  in light of soaring insurance and health care costs.  More
      detailed information will be published as the closing draws nearer.

      1990  offers  special  challenges  and opportunities.  Our mandate has
      never  been  more clear;  the only way we can maintain this company is
      to  provide our customer with the highest quality product, service and
      attitude.    THE  CUSTOMER  IS  KING!  With your continued enthusiasm,
      effort  and  dedication  to  our customers, we will be the best in the
      business!

      On  behalf of all of the Executive Staff I want to thank you again.  I
      know  we  can  count  on you to make 1990 an even greater success than
      1989.

     UPDATE 23 - MARCH 12, 1990

                    BERT NOVAK WEEKLY UPDATE


     Q:       Will there be a 401K or deferred type savings plan in
              the new company?

     A:       We are currently working on the feasibility of
              continuing a 401K plan.  At this point in time it
              appears very promising

     Q:       What happens to my deferred medical fund money with
              McDonnell Douglas when we divest?

     A:       We will continue withholding tax deferred payroll
              medical deductions after divestiture for employees who
              enroll for that service. 

              Your question sounds as if there is a fund of money
              that has accumulated over time.  There is no fund
              involved.  When the payroll deduction is withheld from
              the employee, it is paid to the insurance carrier
              against a premium for medical coverage the employee
              has selected.

         SUBJECT: EMPLOYEE ESOP SURVEY
         FROM:    BERT NOVAK
         TO:      ALL EMPLOYEES
         --------------------------------------------------------------


         A number of questions referencing the ESOP have come up
         regarding the recent communication from Menke & Associates,
         Inc.   

         As an example, one question we have received has been: "Why
         did I not receive a letter?"  Answer:  Only employees
         participating in the 401K or MDC savings plans received
         letters.

         This is a survey of interest; it is not a binding decision on
         your part.  Determination of whether an ESOP will be offered
         in the new company is based upon the survey results.

         Please forward any questions you have to Pat Dwight via ONTYME
         and we will respond to them in the usual process.   For your
         convenience, the deadline for returning the survey 
         has been extended to April 10, 1990.

     TO:    ALL EMPLOYEES
     FROM:  BERT NOVAK
     DATE:  APRIL 3, 1990



     A letter dated 3/21/90 was mailed recently to employees who are
     members of the MDISC Savings Plan.  This letter contained information
     regarding the possibility of the new Field Service Company
     establishing an ESOP with a Savings Plan (Regular as well as Deferral
     Options).

     This message contained a survey requesting that you review the
     information and advise your preference regarding the possible transfer
     of your MDISC Savings Plan funds into the ESOP and the new Savings
     Plan.

     Following are some Questions and Answers on this subject.

     Q.     I'm confused.  I note that the new Field Service Company
            Savings Plan has a Fund A, Fund B and Fund C.  How will these
            Funds differ from the MDISC Fund A, B, and C?

     A.     They won't.  It is planned that Fund A (Fixed Income), Fund B
            (Indexed Equity) and Fund C (Money Market) will consist of the
            same types of investment made for the MDISC Plan.


     Q.     Will there be a Fund D?

     A.     Yes, in the sense that the ESOP (Company stock) is the current
            Fund D's parallel, but at this time there is no intention to
            call it by that name.


     Q.     Is the ESOP a good investment?

     A.     The SEC prevents management from giving investment advice.
            However, the Menke letter shows that if employees commit
            $2,500,000 and the ESOP borrows another $5,600,000, the fund
            will be worth $8,100,000.  It is anticipated that this would be
            paid off in 7 years.  As a comparison, if the account would
            receive employee contributions solely, at the current
            contribution rate, it  is estimated that the value of such an
            account would be approximately $3,500,000 after that same
            amount of time.

     SAVINGS PLAN
     PAGE 2

     Q.     How will the ESOP be paid off?

     A.     It will be paid off by the Company matching contributions,
            discretionary contributions and dividends.


     Q.     I have funds in the Regular Savings Option, the Company
            Deferral Option and Fund D from the MDC match.  How can I roll
            this into the new Company Plan?

     A.     The Regular Savings and Deferral funds can each be rolled over
            in whole or in part to the new Company Plan.  This includes any
            MDC stock purchased with your individual contributions.
            However, MDC matching funds may not be split.  100% must
            either be rolled over directly into the ESOP (new Company
            stock) or distributed directly to you.


     Q.     I have approximately $5,000 in my MDC Deferral Option.  Can I
            choose to put part in the new FSC Plan and keep part of it?

     A.     You may do this.  However, any portion you keep should be
            rolled over into your own IRA or other tax deferred entity,
            otherwise you will pay taxes plus 10% additional income tax on
            the amount you keep.


     Q.     If I decide to put $2,500 in the FSC Savings Plan, how may I
            divide it among FSC Savings funds?

     A.     You may determine which funds you wish to roll your money into,
            the ESOP,and/or Funds A, B, or C.  If you choose the ESOP, at
            least 50% (or, in this instance, $1,250) must be invested.
            Funds A, B, or C require investments of minimum 25%, in 25%
            ($625) increments.

     Q.     I want to complete the survey, but the survey sheet only gives
            me two options each for the Savings Amounts and Deferral
            Amounts, either 100% rollover investment, or 100%
            distribution.  I thought I could choose partial investment and
            partial distribution of each.

     A.     You are correct.  You may choose partial investment and partial
            distribution of each, in 25% increments.  Please note that the
            Company stock requires a 50% minimum and then 25% increments.
            If you choose partial investment of either fund, simply change
            the 100% printed in the sentence to whatever percent you
            choose.  For example, under Compensation Savings Amount in  the
            sentence "I prefer to have 100% of my Compensation  Savings
            amount..."simply change to 25%, 50%, or 75%, if those  are your
            choices.

     Q.     What about the Matching Employer Contributions?

     A.     Those may not be partially invested.  Those may either be
            rolled over or distributed to you as you choose.

Subject: "Last week we responded to a number"... 








     Last week we responded to a number of questions regarding the proposed
     ESOP/Savings Plan for the new Field Service Company.  Those questions
     focussed primarily on the survey regarding your preference as to the
     possible transfer of funds from the MDISC Savings Plan to this
     proposed new Plan.  We have received additional questions regarding
     this Plan.  These questions and the responses are as follows.

     Q.    Can we roll our PAYSOP distribution into the ESOP?

     A.    PAYSOP was adopted on 1/1/83 (for Tymshare employees, this was
           effective 3/30/84), with contributions made by McDonnell Douglas
           Corporation to this fund on behalf of the employees.  You became
           a member of the Plan if you were an employee on 12/31/83,
           12/31/84, 12/31/85 or 12/31/86.  Employees hired after that date
           were not eligible for membership.

           The PAYSOP funds are distributed to each employee/member upon
           that employee's termination.  Therefore, these funds will be
           distributed after the divestiture.  At this time, however,
           rolling the PAYSOP into the ESOP is not contemplated due to MDC
           Plan limitations.

     Q.    If I have not belonged to the MDISC Savings Plan, can I write a
           check for $5000 and put it into the proposed Savings Plan?

     A.    No.  However, an approved IRA can be rolled over into the Plan.
           At this time various options for the Plan are being reviewed,
           and the Prospectus has not been finalized.  It is still
           possible to join the existing Plan if you want to do so.


     Q.    If I have not belonged to the MDISC Savings Plan, how soon can I
           belong to the new Savings Plan.

     A.    We anticipate that the proposed ESOP/Savings Plan will be very
           similar to the current MDISC Plan.  The current Plan allows
           participation after one year of service with the Company, and we
           anticipate that, if you have one year of service, you qualify
           for immediate partipation upon implementation.


     Many details for the proposed ESOP/Savings Plan have not yet been
     decided.  In the meantime, please continue to send in your questions.

                        CAR is a Capital Appropriation Request number assigned
                        by the Finance department.  Any fixed asset being
                        purchased with a unit cost of $1500.00 or above must be
                        capitalized therefore requiring a CAR.

                        When a CAR number is entered in this field, the system
                        check to make sure the number is assigned to the
                        department number entered thereby alleviating the
                        possibility of a person purchasing an item and charging
                        to another department's CAR.

                        The Sub-Account field cannot be overridden when a CAR
                        is entered.

As a reminder when submitting check requests, Accounts
Payable MUST  receive the check request at least 48
hours PRIOR to the date needed (Policy 311 3.3).

Check requests are not a substitute for purchase orders
and the guidelines for purchase orders must be adhered to (Policy 
311 3.5).

With the new purchasing module, you must receive the
item/s in prior to the check request being submitted
and the purchase order (include release numbers) must be
stated on the check request.  Because Accounts Payable is
on a different system, we will not have the information until
the day after you have generated the requisition, a purchase
order has been assigned AND you have received it in.  For
example, you generate a requisition today (5/24/90),
Purchasing issues the purchase order on 5/25/90, and you
received it in on 5/26/90, Accounts Payable will see the
purchase order on the 26th but will not be able to process
the payment until the 27th.

Check requests must be completed (including account
numbers) in accordance withh the Policy #311 and must
include all appropriate back up paperwork.

                                                                Page  2

INVOICES REQUIRING PURCHASE ORDERS:

Items ordered on P.O.'s (blanket or individual) must
also be received in on the system before Accounts
Payable can process for payment.

If you receive the invoice at your office before sending 
it to Accounts Payable, be sure that the correct P.O. #
(including release # for blanket P.O.'s) is clearly
stated on the invoice.

Should you have questions regarding the receiving in of items on the
new Purchasing/Receiving module, please contact 
Brad Bement (x5033) or Mike Brunk (x5009).

     PLEASE POST ON ALL BULLETIN BOARDS:

     UPDATE 24 - MAY 25, 1990

                       BERT NOVAK UPDATE

     Q:       Will there be a Profit Sharing Program for 1990 with
              the new company?

     A:       We are looking into the feasibilities of a Profit
              Sharing Program.

     Q:       Will there be a mandatory retirement age with the new
              company?

     A:       No.  By law, companies cannot enforce a retirement age 
              upon employees.

     Q:       Is there a mandatory retirement age now with MDFSCO?

     A:       No.  The same law applies here.

     Q:       Will we have free coffee with the new company?

     A:       Yes.

     One of the questions previously asked has several aspects which
     requires more detailed clarification at this time:

     Q:       "What happens to my deferred medical fund money with
              McDonnell Douglas when we divest?"

     Previous answer:  We will continue withholding tax deferred
     payroll medical deductions after divestiture for employees who
     enroll for that service.  Your question sounds as if there is a
     fund of money that has accumulated over time.  There is no fund
     involved.  When the payroll deduction is withheld from the
     employee, it is paid to the insurance carrier against a premium
     for medical coverage the employee has selected.




     UPDATE
     Page 2

     Clarification:


     There is no pool of deferred money that has accumulated.

     Unless you have elected otherwise, you have been covered
     automatically by the Pre-Tax Health Care Contribution Plan.
     This provides a way for deducting your health care premium
     contribution from you pay before withholding taxes are taken out
     of your paycheck.  You make your premium contribution by payroll
     deduction with Pre-Tax dollars which are not reported as income
     on your Form W-2 at the end of the year.

     Do not confuse this with the Pre-Tax Spending Accounts, which we
     have previously also had.  The Pre-Tax Spending Accounts allowed
     those enrolled to make Pre-Tax contributions from their pay for
     deposit into a spending account for the purpose of payments for
     certain specific allowable charges, as determined by the IRS.
     The employee was then reimbursed from this account for the
     certain specific charges once claim and paid bill were received
     by the Plan administrators.

     After the divestiture, your health care premium contributions
     will be deducted from your pay before withholding taxes are
     deducted (unless you choose otherwise).

     COMMENT:

     It gives me great pleasure to officially announce that a name
     has been selected for our new company -- NOVADYNE.  Our
     advertising agency has created a dynamic logo design and
     recommended a company color for business cards, letterhead and
     envelopes.  Due to sensitivities of premature celebration and
     dispersal of the design before our divestiture from McDonnell
     Douglas, the design cannot be unveiled for all to see.  However,
     please be aware that the people who are chartered with creation
     and printing of company forms do have copies and are actively
     working on those preparations.

     I will stress that until our official separation from McDonnell
     Douglas, the name and logo design should not be displayed on
     bulletin boards, in cubicles or given to non-MDFSCO employees.
     This may sound strong, and it is.  Until the contract is signed
     and the agreement is complete, we remain McDonnell Douglas.
     There will be an appropriate time to celebrate and relish
     NOVADYNE when that time is right.


     UPDATE
     Page 3



     To bring you up to date on the status of the LBO, the due
     diligence is winding down and contract negotiations are coming
     to an end.  I expect the contract to be signed by June 30 and
     NOVADYNE to emerge during the first week of July, 1990. 

     As I stated many months ago, I appreciate your continued support
     and cooperation during this time of uncertainty.  During the
     next month or two many if not all of your questions will be
     answered.

    On April 2, 1990, a new Purchasing System was installed, 
automating the purchasing function within MDFSCO.  The installation 
of this system had an impact on every employee within this company.

    Having the purchasing function automated means that all personnel 
must be able to access the system and know how to use it properly.  
Training was set up in Santa Ana and the Repair Depots and 
documentation was sent to all offices on the use of the system.  
However, there is still some confusion as to all the different facets 
in the purchasing system and what is required by all users of the 
system.

    During the week of June 18th, several training classes will be 
conducted through out the United States on the Purchasing System.  
Every department is expected to have at least one representative in 
the training.  That person will then be responsible for training all 
other personnel in their department on how to use the system.

    The training agenda will include:

    Creating new requisitions; creating blanket requisitions; 
    receiving purchase orders; how to notify Accounts Payable to pay 
    an invoice; how to set up for on-line approvals; how to approve 
    requisitions; how to change purchase orders; how to find 
    information about purchase orders; how to find out information 
    about sub-accounts and approval levels; what information should 
    be included on the invoices and receiving notices sent to 
    Accounts Payable; how to get check requests; answers to any 
    questions about purchasing you have; and more.


    The training schedule will be:

         Date      Location
-------------------------------------------------------------
         June 19Santa Ana, CA; St. Andrews Lobby Conference Room

         June 19Atlanta, GA Regional Office

         June 20   Rosemont, IL Regional Office

         June 22   Wallingford, CT Regional Office

         June 21San Jose, CA Regional Office

    There will two 3hr sessions at each location:  9am - Noon; 1pm - 
4pm

    It is imperative that all personnel are trained and function 
properly so we can continue to grow and prosper.

     UPDATE 25 - JUNE 20, 1990


                    BERT NOVAK UPDATE


     Q:       When the new company starts will there be any kind of
              suggestion or input system for field engineers to put in
              ideas or get help with problems?

     A:       Yes.  Send them to your manager or myself.  We need
              everyone's input and help to make us the success I know
              we can become.

     Q:       When we are no longer McDonnell Douglas will we be
              allowed to keep our badges for 30 to 60 days?

     A:       Human Resources is working on re-badging at the present
              time.  All Santa Ana-based employees will be issued new
              badges on the day of divestiture.  The reason for this
              is that the McDonnell Douglas badges will be collected
              by the facilities group the next working day after close
              of the sale.  Martin Torres is notifying the remote
              offices as to the badging procedures to follow.

     Q:       Currently MDFSCO has an agreement with DEC for
              reproducing documentation for some nominal fee.  Will
              this continue after June 30?

     A:       Yes.

     Q:       Also MDFSCO has a discount with DEC on the purchase of
              spares as we probably have with other vendors.  Will the
              new company be able to continue with these discounts?

     A:       Some vendors yes; DEC, no.

     Q:       Will McDonnell Douglas provide us new documentation such
              as circuit schematics considered "Proprietary" after
              divestiture?

     A:       No.  We are paying for the use of all trade secrets and
              proprietary information used in the business.

     UPDATE

     Q:       What will be the new vacation policy?  Will the existing
              policy be used or will everyone go back to two weeks a
              year?

     A:       Vacation time will not change after divestiture.
              Employees will not lose any of their time and will
              continue to accrue vacation time based on the existing
              policy.

     Q:       As a field employee it bothers me that HMO medical
              coverage is available to employees in California only.
              Why can't arrangements be made with the existing HMO's
              utilized by MDC to transfer coverage under Novadyne?
              When, if at all, could the field personnel expect to be
              offered HMO coverage?

     A:       Due to lack of employee density we were not able to
              offer HMO's to the field offices.  MDC has a vast
              network of employees in many locations.  This provides
              large centers of employees available for enrollment in
              HMO's.  This also provides leverage for negotiations.

              During the coming year we intend to negotiate for HMO
              coverages in some of those areas in which we have larger
              population centers.  If we are successful in contracting
              for such coverages, we will offer enrollment during the
              next open enrollment period.

                  SANTA ANA, Calif., July 2, 1990 -- NOVADYNE Computer
         Systems, Inc, formerly  McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company,
         was founded today.  NOVADYNE Computer Systems, Inc. remains one
         of the largest independent field service and computer systems
         distribution organizations in North America, with over 1000
         professionals located in over 100 offices across the nation. 
                  The management buyout, headed by president and chief
         executive officer Bert Novak, began 11 months ago with McDonnell
         Douglas Corp.  Many financing alternatives were investigated,
         resulting in the selection of Menke Titolo Capital Corp. to lead
         the financial syndication.  "The same strong management team
         that was formed approximately three years ago and helped put
         this company together will now be running NOVADYNE," Novak said.

         customer on behalf of OEMs and Resellers, allowing them the
         freedom to concentrate on manufacturing and distribution of
         products.
                  NOVADYNE Computer Systems, Inc. recently assumed all
         sales and marketing responsibility for McDonnell Douglas
         Computer Systems products sold through dealers and VARs in North
         America.  "This sets our company apart, as we are the only
         nationwide non-manufacturing distributor capable of offering
         total software and hardware support to its Reseller network,"
         Novak said.
                  Distribution products are currently based on the
         McDonnell Douglas series of super mini computers, utilizing
         unique modular architecture to deliver faster CPU performance.
         These product offerings also include a broad range of software
         packages such as office automation, PC connectivity
         applications, and distribution management systems for general
         business which are marketed through its Reseller channel.
                  In the first quarter of 1990, the company announced the
         LX/2100 systems, the company's first entry into the UNIX(R)
         market.  LX/2100 systems are based on Sun Microsystems' SPARC(R)
         architecture, the most popular UNIX platform in the world.
                  "We will continue to expand our computer and network
         maintenance services to our Third and Fourth party markets.  We
         also intend to develop the distribution side of the business by
         attracting new OEMs and Resellers, and from this strong
         foundation, we will continue our heritage of continuous growth
         and expansion," Novak said.

Please note that due to a systems error final MDC payroll checks
failed to deduct savings and deferral contributions and hence no
matching funds were credited to the individual's savings account.

MDC is in the process of correcting this and further details will 
be forthcoming.

           EMPLOYEE PAYROLL STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (PAYSOP)

FROM:      Joyce Siegfried

SUBJECT:   PAYSOP DISTRIBUTION

DATE:      July 23, 1990

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Richard M. Smoski, Plan Administrator of the Employee Payroll Stock
Ownership Plan recently sent a letter to employees who participated in
the Plan. This letter solicited the employee's election to withhold or
not withhold Federal or State Income Tax from the PAYSOP distribution.

Some employees have questioned whether or not it is possible to have
this distribution made in the form of a MDC Stock Certificate rather
than distribution of the value of the account by check.  It is
possible.  If you are interested in receiving the stock certificate
you may do so by writing an informal memo to:

                       Pam Nelson
                       McDonnell Douglas Corporation
                       Attn:  Savings Operations
                       Dept. H 329
                       P.O. Box 516
                       St. Louis, MO 63166-9984

Be sure to include your name, social security number and address in
the memo.  You may also FAX your request.  The FAX number is (314)
777-1012.

If your Tax Election Form was received in the St. Louis Savings office
prior to 4:30 PM, Friday, July 20, 1990, your distribution may have
been included in the July payment "run" and, if so, will be mailed out
this week.  If you had wanted a stock certificate please call Pam
Nelson in the Savings office.  Her telephone number is (314)
232-8971.  She will determine whether or not your distribution was
included in the July "run".  If it was, she will advise you regarding
the appeal process.

    All field employees will be receiving information at their homes
    regarding the Novadyne 401(k)/Savings Plan.  Mutual Benefit Life
    Insurance Company will be servicing the plan.  It is anticipated
    this package will be mailed on Friday, August 17th.  

    This is your opportunity to save pre-tax and/or after-tax dollars
    through payroll deductions.  You may also roll over all or part
    of the taxable portion of your McDonnell Douglas ISC Plan
    distribution into the NOVADYNE Plan, thereby continuing to defer
    tax liability on that money.  (Remember that any rollover into a
    qualified plan must be done within 60 days of distribution.)  

    Please review the Savings Plan package carefully.  Whether or not
    you choose to participate in this benefit, you must return both
    Application for Participation forms (401k and After Tax
    Contribution) to Human Resources by Friday, September 7th.  If
    you choose not to participate, simply complete your name and
    social security number, check the waiver box, sign and date the
    form, and return it to Human Resources.

    Please feel free to contact Mutual Benefit Life at 800/288-8131

Subject: 401 K PLAN 






      September 7, 1990




      ALL NOVADYNE EMPLOYEES:

      As you know, Novadyne is in the process of establishing a
      401(k) plan similar to the McDonnell Douglas plan in which
      our employees participated.  Previously we discussed with
      you certain investment options that may be available under
      the plan for investment of your before-tax contributions,
      after-tax contributions, and rollover contributions.  These
      investment options included a real estate investment fund
      for any of your contributions and a McDonnell Douglas stock
      you may have received from the McDonnell Douglas plan.  As
      the result of a lack of interest expressed by employees in
      these two funds, the cost of administering these funds
      outweighs the benefits of maintaining the funds.
      Accordingly, we have decided we must eliminate both the
      real estate investment fund and the McDonnell Douglas stock
      fund as investment options under the plan.

      If you elected to invest any of your contributions in the
      real estate fund, you must revise your election by
      designating one or more of the other available funds as
      your investment choice for those contributions.  If you
      delivered McDonnell Douglas stock to us as a rollover
      contribution, you have two options.  You can instruct us to
      sell your MDC stock and invest the proceeds in one or more
      of the other available investment funds under the plan.
      Alternatively, because the rollover has not yet been
      completed, you can instruct us to return your MDC stock so
      that you can establish your own IRA to hold the rollover
      stock.  You should be aware, however, that a rollover of
      MDC stock from the MDC plan to your own IRA must occur
      within 60 days of the date the stock was distributed to you
      from the MDC plan in order for you to avoid current
      taxation on the distribution.  Therefore, you may have a
      very short period to establish your own IRA and complete
      the rollover.

      Please contact Betty Rosser at 714/566-4036 if you have any
      further questions and to give us your instructions.

      Very truly yours,

Subject: LOG-ON TO CHAD PROBLEMS 

    Recently we have had many complaints, both from in-house and from the
    field, about not being able to log-on to CHAD.  Some of the problems
    point to misuse of the network.  We would like to give you some
    guidelines to help you in this stressful situation.

    After receiving the 'host: call connected' message from Tymnet you are
    connected to the Novadyne network.  Once you enter your select string,
    'FSC-1', you will get the 'LOGON TO FSC-1 :' prompt.  If instead you get
    one of the following messages, please follow the suggested recovery.

    SUCCESSFUL CONNECTION

    Cause:                                                             
    A connection has been made between you and FSC-1 or the selected system.

    Suggested Recovery:


    Press the Return key once or twice.

    SUCCESSFUL CONNECTION (but no characters are echoed back, appears to be
    hung)

    Cause: 

    1. Host port configured incorrectly.
    2. Cable not connected at host end.
    3. Host port bad.

    Suggested Recovery:


    * Call for support.

    DESTINATION BUSY

    Cause:


    All ports for the system you have selected are busy on the network side.

    Suggested Recovery:


    * Call for support

    INVALID SELECTION

    Cause:


    The Select String specified is not valid.

    Suggested Recovery:


    Press return and carefully re-type a valid Select String.


    INVALID CONFIGURATION

    Cause: 

    The configuration parameters between the origination and destination
    network ports are not compatible.

    Suggested Recovery:


    * Call for support.

    DISPLAY ON SCREEN IS NOT FORMATTED CORRECTLY

    Cause:


    Flow control not set correctly on host port.

    Suggested Recovery:


    * Call for support.

    GARBAGE CHARACTERS - LINES - REVERSE VIDEO etc...

    Cause:


    Line noise.

    Suggested Recovery:


    Terminate connection by disconnecting the phone line and place call
    again.

    PORT HANGS AFTER LOGON OR SOMETIME DURING DIALOGUE

    Cause:


    1. Flow control not set correctly on host port.
    2. Host may be suffering slow logon.  Usually after AF-Restore or
    coldstart.  Host must gather workspace.

    Suggested Recovery:


    * Call for support.


    LOGGED OFF BACK TO TYMNET PROMPT BY ITSELF

    Cause:


    1. The network saw a disconnect character from its destination or
    originator.
    2. Tymnet problem.
    3. Spike on the telephone line.

    Suggested Recovery:


    Select the destination again and continue.  If problem persists call for
    support.

    HOST SHUT

    Cause:


    The Tymnet host you have reached is unavailable.

    Suggested Recovery:


    * Call for support.

    Once you do get a successful connection, please make sure that when you
    are done with your session you disconnect correctly.  Make sure you are
    at the Tymnet prompt before you disconnect your modem.  Entering 'OUT' at
    the system logon prompt will take you to the Tymnet login prompt.

    Most of the reported problems on the network are caused by users not
    logging off correctly.  It takes up a lot of precious time from every
    department to clear up the situation.  With a little care we can prevent
    most of these problems.  If you disconnect while still on the system you
    will almost definitely leave a hung port on the network.  This adds to
    the problem of not being able to log on to the system due to hung ports
    on the network.

    If you are using a program that automatically dials the modem, logs you
    on to the network and then on to the system, please do not leave it
    unattended.  Make sure it does not go into a loop and logs on to every
    available port on the network (it has happened).

    We understand your frustration, but hitting the carriage return for
    several seconds does not make the system or the network work any faster.
    During high traffic times, the host runs slower.  Be patient.  Wait for
    the Logon prompt and/or the network banner before entering any more
    characters.

    If you are having problems getting on to the system or the network call
    in for support.  Help us help you. It could be your modem, terminal or
    program and not the network or system.
     
         For support call MIS Operations Support at 714 566-4093 or 714
         566-4688.  If no answer, call Central Dispatch on 800 678-3399.

   FROM: LES ROGERS (SUN PLANNER)

   COPIES: ALL FIELD PERSONNEL

   SUBJECT: SUN 8" 892MB DISC DRIVES


          I have had a couple of calls from the field concerning 8"
   892MB Disk Drives for SUN.  The problem they are having is that
   the 5 Part Numbers crossed on AIMS are "all good" physical
   working spares, but they have different mounting rails which can
   not be changed from the NEC model to the Hitachi model or
   vise-versa.  I have listed below the 6 part numbers and I have
   them listed the way I plan to cross them on AIMS with the
   numbers that have matching rails only.  The parts as listed on
   AIMS:

                1) 595-1552-01
                2) 555-1008
                3) DK815-10
                4) 815-10
                5) 370-1141
                6) 370-1140

          The parts with matching rails split the 5 into to groups
   of numbers as follows:

          Group 1  all have NEC type rails
                595-1552-01
                370-1141
                370-1140

          Group 2  all have Hitachi type rails
                DK815-10
                815-10
                555-1008

          So when ordering make sure you know what type of rails
   you need.  Group 1 has wide and flat rails, See Diagram 1.
   Group 2 has small track type rails, See Diagram 2.  

          I hope this helps in getting the right drive to the Field
   when needed.  If you have any questions please call Les Rogers
   at 714-566-5033.

   Thank you,

     Employees  enrolled  in  the Driver Reimbursement Program can now
     access  current  rate and expense miles information through CHAD.
     A  process  is  being  added which will enable managers to access
     this information for their direct reports.

     Employees  should  log  onto  CHAD  in  the normal way and select
     STATS.   Then select #6 "FINANCE" and #11, "DRIVERS REIMBURSEMENT
     INQUIRY".    This  should  arrive at a screen with options to see
     their expense miles or their reimbursement rates.

     Managers  hould be able to access their direct reports, but this
     is currently still in the works.

     Please direct questions to me at 714/566-4843.

   SUBJECT: SUN CPU BDS WITH REMOVABLE MEMORY

          WORKING WITH THE REPAIR CENTER, WE HAVE NOTICED THAT WE HAVE
   BEEN RECEIVING SOME SUN CPU BOARDS FOR MODELS 4/60 AND 3/80 WITH ONE,
   MORE, OR ALL THE 1MB SIMMS MEMORY MISSING. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO
   REASON FOR THESE BOARDS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE BOARD, UNLESS THERE IS
   A MEMORY PROBLEM.  IF SO, THE PART YOU WOULD NEED IS P/N 501-1408 1MB 

   SIMMS MEMORY OR P/N 501-1697 WHICH IS A DIRECT REPLACEMENT FOR THE
   SUN BOARD IF NOT AVAILABLE.

          WE DID HAVE ONE SET OF PARTS CROSSED ON AIMS WHICH IS NOT NOW,
   SO THAT YOU ONLY RECEIVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MEMORY THAT WE WANT IN
   RETURN FROM THE FIELD.  IF WE RECEIVE A BOARD WITH THE MEMORY GONE
   THE DEPARTMENT THAT RETURNED THE BOARD WILL BE CHARGED "THE FULL
   AMOUNT" TO REPLACE THE MEMORY ON THE BOARD.

          LISTED BELOW IS THE PARTS WE WERE HAVING TROUBLE WITH, AND HOW
   WE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF YOU NOT HAVING THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY YOU
   NEED.
                P/N  501-1382  4/60 CPU 4MB (REPLACED BY)
                P/N  501-1629  4/60 CPU 4MB (REPLACED BY)
                P/N  501-1632  4/65 CPU 8MB  (THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN
   REMOVED FROM THE CROSS REFERENCE SECTION WITH THE TWO BOARDS IT
   REPLACES BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH 4MB BOARDS.)

                P/N  501-1401  3/80 CPU 4MB
                P/N  501-1650  3/80 CPU 4MB  (THESE TWO BOARDS ARE THE
   SAME AND SHOULD NOT HAVE MEMORY REMOVED OFF OF IT.)

          REMEMBER IF YOU NEED MEMORY ORDER MEMORY, AND IF YOU NEED A
   CPU REPLACE IT WITH THE CPU THAT HAS THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF MEMORY ON
   IT, 4MB OR 8MB.  WE MUST RECEIVE SUN BOARDS WITH ALL THE CHIPS ON 

   IT.  "IF YOU RECEIVE A SUN BOARD FROM A VENDOR WITH ANY CHIPS MISSING
   CALL ME (LES ROGERS) IMMEDIATELY AT 714-566-5033 AND I WILL TAKE CARE
   OF THE PROBLEM ASAP!"

          THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP, THIS HELPS THE REPAIR CYCLE GO
   FASTER.

     paying  firmware  charges only.  This will allow Central Dispatch
     to  open  software  calls  for  these customers, since Department
     80000  does  not  allow  calls  to  be  opened.    All  customers
     currently  paying  for firmware only have already been updated on
     CHAD.    Firmware  only  customers,  who  have been identified as
     collection  problems  by  the Credit department have been left as
     80000  and  noted in the comments field that all support has been
     suspended.    In  order  to  keep  this  new system accurate, the
     responsible  field offices will be asked to observe the following
     guidelines

                   Only use Department 80000 when the firmware
                   board has actually been removed.  Input on the
                   first comments line (11) "FIRMWARE REMOVED
                   MM/DD/YY".  Also, please ensure that the 
                   hardware and software support hours (31 & 32)
                   have been blanked out.

                   Use Department 90822 as soon as the maintenance
                   agreement expires.  The customer will continue
                   to be billed for the firmware, and is thus 
                   eligible  for software support, until the4 Activity

                   Report is received indicating that the firmware
                   has actually been removed.

     On   a  different,  but  related  issue,  please  remember,  that
     Novadyne   field  offices  should  not  be  involved  in  REALITY
     licensing  activities,  especially  on used equipment.  It is the
    responsibility  of  the  ISO's  to  execute  the Operating System
     Licenses  for  any  systems  in their territory.  If you have any
     questions  about  this,  contact  Leslie  Cavic  in  St. Louis at
     314/739-6336.

I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE REPAIR CENTER ON THE SUN MOUSE PARTS THAT HAVE 
BEEN RETURNED TO THE REPAIR CENTER. LEE AND CYNTHIA OF REPAIR TESTED THE PARTS
AND NOTICED THAT THEY WILL WORK ON A LARGER GRID PATTERN BUT NOT ON THE SMALLER
PATTERN THAT COMES FROM SUN. SO , I WOULD LIKE TO GET ALL THE PARTS RETURNED TO
THE REPAIR CENTER FOR TESTING WHETHER REPAIRABLE OR EXPENDABLE. AFTER WE GET
THEM BACK WE CAN DECIDE IF THE EXPENDABLE ONES ARE REPAIRABLE TO MAKE THE PART
NUMBERS SUBS OF EACH OTHER. BUT , I CAN ONLY DO THAT IF THE REPAIR CENTER 
CONFIRMS THAT YES WE CAN REPAIR THEM. THE PART NUMBERS ARE LISTED BELOW , BOTH 
THE EXPENDABLE AND THE REPAIRABLE. PLEASE REMEMBER WE WANT THEM "ALL" BACK.

Subject: VACATION TIME 








       DATE:      JUNE 19, 1991
       TO:        ALL NOVADYNE EMPLOYEES
       FROM:      BERT NOVAK
       SUBJECT:   POLICY CHANGE


       Effective  July  1,  1991, all employees must take vacation hours
       in  excess  of their annual accrual amount minus 40 hours.  These
       hours must be taken prior to December 31, 1991.


                  MAX HOURS PERMITTED 31/DEC TO CARRY OVER TO 1992:

                  0 TO 4.9 YEARS OF SERVICE  
                  80 HOURS MINUS 40 HOURS    = 40 HOURS

                  5 TO 9.9 YEARS OF SERVICE
                  120 HOURS MINUS 40 HOURS   = 80 HOURS

                  10 PLUS YEARS OF SERVICE
                  160 HOURS MINUS 40 HOURS   = 120 HOURS  


       Managers  will  be  consulting  with each employee on their staff
       regarding  individual  hours  which  need  to  be  scheduled.  We
       expect  all employees to schedule vacation hours currently on the
       books  as  well as additional hours that you will accrue over the
       next  six months which may again cause you to be in excess of the
       above   criteria.      Managers   will  consider  your  preferred
       scheduling  needs  in  light of the business needs and the number
       of  employees  within  your  department  who  will also be taking
       vacation hours.

       Effective  January  1,  1992,  a new VACATION ACCRUAL CAP will be
       implemented.   The new policy will be one and one-half times your
       annual  accrual  rate.    You may carry over this amount into the
       next  fiscal  year.   The current accrual rate, based on years of
       service,  will remain in effect for 1992.  Once you reach the cap
       you  will not accrue more vacation until hours have been taken to
       reduce that amount below the new cap.

       We  encourage  employees  to  take  July 1, July 2 and July 3 as
       vacation  days,  with  management concurrence.  This will provide
       you  with  a  full week off by combining the vacation and holiday
       hours.

     A problem was reported to the MIS department which occurred when printing
     CHAD reports.  Some individuals would experience a blank page between each
     page of their reports regardless of how many pages the report contained.
     The problem has been identified and only relates to individuals who are
     using Procomm Plus 2.0.

     This version of Procomm required the patch FORMFEED.DPT to take care of
     this problem.  To get a copy of this, copy PATCH20.COM from VAXCOMS to
     your Pcplus directory.  Next execute patch20.com.  This will give you any
     possible patch which you might need to correct software dficiencies
     documented in PATCHES.DOC.  If you write scripts, you will also want to
     run the patch SWITCH.DPT.  Your manual will explain how to deal with
     patches.  The new version of Procomm Plus 2.1 already has these patches
     incorporated into its software.

SOLD 6.3g off-line diagnostics for the M6000 have been production released.
Targetted 1/2-inch and 1/4-inch tapes are now being distributed to all
Field Engineers who had tapes requested for them by their manager.

SOLD 6.3 should be used for all Spirit II, Galaxy 2.4, Spirit 7.X, and
Galaxy 7.0 systems.  DOCOL should only be used for Spirit I systems.

As the 6.3 SOLD tapes are received, time should be scheduled with 
customers to reformat their disc drives.  This is necessary to support
the on-line S.O.M.E. diagnostics which will be distributed shortly.
S.O.M.E. should eliminate the need to go on site to reassign bad
tracks/sectors and, therefore, we want to put a high priority on 
getting it installed.  The first step is to get the drives reformatted.

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call on 
extension 4826.

   It is with regret that I announce the resignation of Mike Parker from the
   position of Planning Manager.  Mike is a country boy at heart and is
   moving back to his childhood home in Idaho with his family.  We will miss
   him and we wish him the very best for the future.

   If anyone hears of a job in Idaho or Washington State that would interest
   Mike, he can be contacted via Barry Pringle at Santa Ana.  Mike thanks Ron
   Dvorsky for his kind offer of a potato fork.

   Mike will be replaced by Fred Feldman.

   It is with pleasure that I announce the promotion of Fred Feldman to
   Planning Manager within the Logistics Group.  Fred brings many years
   experience of purchasing and planning to the group.

   Fred has a BS in Accounting from UCLA and an MS in Business from Cal Poly,
   Pomona,  He can be contacted at 714-566-2019.

   I know that you will all give your help and support to Fred as he takes
   over this extremely busy function.

    FROM:         Dick Curtiss, Director - Facilities and Administration

    SUBJECT:      Consolidation and Conversion of Telephone Calling Cards



    Effective November 27, 1991, all Novadyne-issued AT&T telephone
    calling cards will be converted to MCI telephone calling cards.  To
    avoid an interruption in your service, please note the following:


           ALL existing credit card accounts will be cancelled on December
           18, 1991.

           If you currently have a calling card with AT&T AND this card
           was obtained through our Credit Card Administration Department,
           do nothing.  A replacement MCI card will be sent to you
           automatically.


           If you currently have a calling card that was NOT obtained
           through Credit Card Administration, you MUST submit an approved
           "Request for Credit Card Issuance" form (see attached) by
           December 9, 1991 in order to obtain an MCI calling card.
           Credit Card Administration will no longer recognize calling
           card charges of other carriers and will discontinue payment of
           charges made after December 31, 1991.



    If you have questions, please contact Dianna Ford at (714) 566-2926
    (phone) or (714) 258-1609 (fax).  Thank you for your cooperation.

    DATE:       December 11, 1991

    TO:         All Cellular Telephone Users

    FROM:       Helen Barney, Controller

    SUBJECT:    Written Pre-Authorization of Cellular Telephone Charges


    Policy 320, "Reimbursement of Cellular Telephone Charges," has been
    published.  Cellular telephone charges included on Expense Reports
    covering periods after December 1, 1991, will be reimbursed under the
    regulations of the new policy.  However, you will receive additional
    time to comply with Regulation 4.3.

    Under Regulation 4.3 of the policy, reimbursement for the use of
    cellular telephones must now be preauthorized, in writing, by a
    Vice-President.  See Exhibit A of Policy 320 for a sample of the
    authorization form.  If your signed authorization is not on file with
    Expense Report Control before Friday, January 10, 1992, your
    reimbursements will be suspended until your authorization is
    received.  This requirement applies to existing, as well as, new
    users.

    Authorizations must be renewed every fiscal year.  It will be your
    responsibility to ensure that a new authorization is on file by
    January 1st of each year.

    If you have questions about the authorization requirements, call Judi
    Marshall, A/P Section Manager, at (714) 566-3768.  If you need a copy
    of Policy 320, contact your manager.
