Subject: BADGE Meeting


Reminder that the January BADGE meeting is Thursday, January 20th,
at 8pm. The meeting is at Turing Auditorium (as always) and open
to everyone interested in programming the Amiga.

I don't know who the speaker is this month, but I'll post it if I find
out before the meeting. (Last month we saw Dale showing off the 1Kx800x2
monitor, X (running under AmigaDOS, *not* Unix), and the fast file
system... Very neat stuff!)

I don't know much about Lattice C (I use Manx), but $90 doesn't sound
bad. But make sure it is version 4.0 --- Lattice 3.03 is supposed to be
very slow, and 3.10 is a bit better. But 4.0 includes a lot of optimizing
code and such.

In any case, make sure you get some extra memory (1.5 Megs or more!) if you
want to do serious development. I and my girlfriend did some programming
on a 512K machine, and then on a 1 Meg machine, and currently on a 2.5 Meg
machine, and believe me with lots of memory everything is so much
smoother and faster... Even GURUs aren't so bothersome anymore!

Subject: My amiga stays with me :-)

Hi,

As some of you might know, I have an A500, and have long wondered
how I get that machine to run when I go back to Denmark where we
run a 220/50hz PAL world.

I asked here and there and got different answers until yesterday
reading the usenet amiga group, I suddenly realized that commodore
amiga group was on the net - so I asked a guy there directly, and here
is what I got:

>The A500 should work fine with an 110V 50hz supply. As the 2080 is getting
>RGB + sync info from the computer, it too will work. To change to a PAL
>system you would need to replace the hi-order clock crystal and the AGNUS
>chip. The 2080 monitor is capable of being tweaked to a PAL screen by adjusting
>the Vertical Heigth. You might want to purchase a replacement power supply
>to better match the 220V 50HZ as the standard supply may overheat at 110V
>50Hz.

I thought someone might be tempted to buy a new Agnus and clock crystal,
as that seems to turn your machine into a 256 line machine.
(a super-morerows gimmic)

Anyway - I am happy I can look forward to living with my Amiga for more
than a year ahead.

When I make a picture in DpaintII using black on white background, And
then prints this picture out - DPaint in its superior wisdom thinks I
want the the same aspect as on the screen - which makes characters look
somewhat strange.

Does anyone know of a dump printprogram that prints a black pixel when
there is a black pixel, a white for white, and do not do any aspect stuff?

Subject: FAUG, UW


Reminder to all that FAUG (First Amiga User's Group) meeting is tonight...
It's at Palo Alto Hyatt, at 7:30pm.

I finally got the chance to look at and install UW (Unix Windows). UW
gives you terminal emulation over the serial line, but lets you have up to
seven windows at once. You just have to be connected to some Unix
host on which you are running the UW server. On the Amiga you run the
UW client (a rather tiny program). Then you can telnet from your Unix host
to other machines and be connected to different machines in different
windows.

Installation was painless; one problem is that UW only provides ANSI
emulation (no VT100 or H19). On Rocky Emacs works fine, but under TOPS-20
Emacs has problems. Being as much of a TOPS-20 person as Unix person,
I need Emacs to run under TOPS-20, so I need some reasonable terminal
emulation. But, if your main domain is Unix, then this program can serve
you well. It runs on a 512K machine without any problems, and you do not
need to be a superuser to install the Unix side.

Anyway, let me know if you are interested in getting copies of UW.

Ali

Subject: DNET network protocol

Has anyone FTPed Matt Dillon's DNET with intent to build the host side for
a UNIX machine on campus?  What is DNET, you ask?  Umm, hereis some less
oblique information:


Message-ID: <8802070403.AA14080@cory.Berkeley.EDU>
Date: 7 Feb 88 04:03:46 GMT
Sender: daemon@ucbvax.BERKELEY.EDU
Lines: 39


	I am trying to find people interested in testing and writing servers
for DNET.  I currently have DNET working between an Amiga and a UNIX 4.3
machine.  DNET is a windowed protocol which supports up to 65535 independant
server-client connections in both directions over your dialup (tty) line.

	For large transfers, DNET has tested out to about 94% the raw line
speed.  As DNET has an underlying protocol, data is essentially guarenteed
(no noise).

	DNET uses a server-client/port scheme similar to the internet scheme.
It is relatively trivial to write servers and applications for it.  I have
already written a file transfer server and terminal-rlogin (though it currently
cannot handle window-resizing automatically.  I also was able to hack up a
server on the Amiga end to allow remote logins to the Amiga (you get a shell).

	DNET is not on the internet, but it would be relatively trivial to
write a glue server listening both on the internet and on DNET's AF_UNIX
sockets.  DNET *does* use UNIX domain sockets which allows users to have
completely independant DNET's running.  As I type this, I have two other
terminal windows open and a very large file transfer running (unread
comp.sys.amiga news).

	At the moment I only want people who either have two Amigas (connect
serial ports together with Tx/Rx and a few other lines flipped), or have
an Amiga and a UNIX BSD 4.3 account (4.2 should work also).  After we get it
debugged I'll post a cleaned up version to the net.  You can also ask me
to send it to you for the hell of it.  Those of you who might want to port
it to other mini's or mainframes should wait until the cleaned-up debugged
version is sent to the net.

	Those people on the ARPA net should make my life easy and FTP
into pub/amiga on ucbvax.berkeley.edu (dnet.arc) ... it's not on there yet...
mail me so I know when I have to start putting on ucbvax.

	I'm gratified by the number of responses I've gotten on DNET.  The
alpha is now available for ARPAnet users via anonymous ftp to
ucbvax.berkeley.edu.  Hopefully this will mean some good things in a couple
of months for those of you who do not have arpa access.

	The alpha is nearly 380K.. somewhat difficult to send to USENET
sites, but those of you on the USENET who want it should mail me and
include the fastest route you know of to get from me to you.  If you are
too many hops away from a major node I probably will have problems getting
it to you, in which case you can send me EMail and I'll send you the
stuff (but if you can send me EMail asking for my address,and then send me
a disk, that would be MUCH more preferable).

	One of things that will get written soon (has yet to be written)
will be an NFS using DNET... although the current version has a client/server
to send files/directories there is something very special about being
able to CD into DNET: and onto a remote host.

First impressions of DNET.

      *****    GEE, THIS IS GREAT!    *****
hmm, i blew all that time on internet.device and then matt
comes out with this thing ... it just isn't fair.

   First off, it works. Second off, it requires no kernel hacks,
yet also appears to be pretty efficient. Although there does seem
to be a slightly longer echo loop it is not real bad even at 9600,
at least i don't think. But the real amazing thing is how well file transfer
works. Beautifully. and fast, as fast as tcp/ip over SLIP. I am
impressed.
   There is only one slight caveat. In moving from TCP to DNET
you are moving from a very standard protocol which runs on lots
of different OSs to one which is 4.xbsd specific. On the other
hand you could probably move dnet to many different machines.
I think i may drop internet.device and move over to dnet (but am
not sure yet). No matter what, DNET is quite a piece of work.
Makes me wonder why i bought a C compiler!
   Highly recommended for a test-drive at least!

I've just `finished' a new program, a disk copier and formatter.  It

addition, it has a number of additional features and a nice Intuition
interface.  Please try it out, and report any bugs, misfeatures,

documentation is at the very top of the source file.  The files are in

I've tested it out fairly thoroughly, but you might want to write-protect

Oh, and in other news, Commodore apparently did reach its goal of
selling half million Amigas by end of 1987. And the number is growing
wildly! Commodore also posted profits of $20.7 million for second quarter
of 1987, profits mostly due to the Amiga.

Subject: recoverable ram disk

I've had a lot of trouble getting the asdg recoverable ram disk to work.
I got the device both from a bulletin board and from the Draco SYS disk
(Fred Fish 76); neither version seems to work. I've made sure the mountlist
for VD0: has the correct buffer size and type for my 2 megs of fast ram
(I've also tried variations), and I've made sure that the MountList and
the asdg.vdisk.device file both reside in DEVS: where they belong. But
no amount of resetting or cold-booting gets the system to even recognize
that VD0: exists.  If anyone knows about subtle quirks of the MountList
file or knows some other reason for the problem, I seriously need help.
(By the way, I also tested the normal RAM: device to see if VD0 was somehow
hidden under that name, but it didn't keep its files thru reset)

Subject: Address...


Does anyone here know the mailing address of the person who made dnet at
berkeley? I finally got fed up with the editor "med". I tried "dme" and
I know that he (I think he is called Matt?) has a copy in /pub/amiga
at ucbvax. However there seems to be a checksum error in his file, so
I would like to get hold of him.

Any other editors around? I am really not that critical but the following
are the rules:
* It must be able to produce european letters - that rules out uedit, and
  a number of emacs (as the use the ALT key for their own purpose)
* I want just a little user friendlyness. I do not want to memorize 50 commands
  by strange shift key escape sequences.

Any suggestions?

If you buy Manx C, you get the 'Z' editor, which is a lot like
vi (it's just missing some features, and has improved with the 3.6
release of the compiler).

Or, you could run PC/VI on the PC side of a 2000, I suppose.

Subject: Amiga in the news!

Breaking every copyright law in existence, but from the Times Tribune
(Palo Alto) on the top of page one, we find:

New system could be the ultimate in backseat driving!

SAN FRANCISCO--The California Department of Transportation and Radar
Control Systems Corp. on Thursday unveiled a prototype computer
attachment for vehicles that officials said could alleviate traffic
congestion and may even save lives.

The device consists of a radar antenna attached to the front of the
car that senses motion and an internally mounted computer that
``speaks'' to the driver and activates braking if necessary.

The system, known as LOOKOUT, will allow motorists to drive closer
together and allow for increased traffic flow, Caltrans interim
Director Donald L. Watson said during a news conference.

Caltrans heard about Radar Control Systems while searching for
solutions to traffic congestion and was impressed with the radar
device, Watson said.

``People can drive faster and closer, and we don't have to build
new freewyas . . . We can't build our way out of this situation,''
he explained.

``We know that there's a lot of space between cars.  Moving faster
at a closer distance is still safe, with this technology,'' Watson
said.

The Bay Area is facing one of the highest annual traffic increases
in the state at 27 percent, Watson said.  The Los Angelos area is
experiencing `only' a 15 percent increase, he added.

The radar system serves as a detection device for frontal traffic,
and if the driver doesn't respond in the usual 0.7 seconds, the
device will apply the brakes within 0.2 seconds, if necessary, John
Davis, the radar system's inventor, said.

The prototype displayed at the press conference was mounted in a
1977 Dodge Sportsman van.  inside, an Amiga computer terminal
displayed a video image of what was in front of the van through a
camera that was mounted on the dash.

When the vehicle came too close to another vehicle, building or
sign post, an automated voice would issue such commands as
``Watch it'' and ``Slow down.''

``The roads are nice, the cars are nice, but the driver needs help,''
Davis said.  ``This allows him to maintain a safety margin'' at
higher speeds.

The radar is capable of scanning 20,000 feet ahead of the car, but
will only emit a command or activate the brakes if it senses any
immediate danger, Davis said.

Davis estimated that the device could halve the number of traffic
accidents in California.

Davis has worked on the device full time for about five years at
Radar Control Systems.

Davis said he expects the system will be available for production
in about two years.  Current cost estimates range between $500 and
$1000 per car, depending on model and driver programming requests,
Davis said.

(Pictured is your basic two-drive 1000 with a 1080 monitor, strapped
down inside the van.)

Subject: PAK-68 68020/881 board


Last night at FAUG Bryce Nesbitt patched KS1.2 so that my german 68020 kit board would work under 1.2 without an 881.  Shortly thereafter, Dale Luck told me
what that section of code expects if there's no 881, and this morning I did a
one minute reversible hardware hack to produce the desired result.

So I now have a 68020 board that works in a 500, 2000 or 1000 which costs
about $60 plus a couple of hours to build, plus the price of the 68020.

I have also found today a source of 16 mhz 881s for $145.  I will buy today
or tomorrow and let you all know how it comes out.

I'll make up a nice little set of text files for dissemination to anyone
who wants to take this project on.  I guess the only thing you will find
harder than I did is finding a dirt-cheap 68020.  This same chip source will
do no better than $75 for the 12 mhz 68020.  Nonetheless, you can have the
equivalent of the CSA piggyback with 881 (faster, since it's a 16 mhz 881
instead of a 12 mhz) for about $280 instead of $700 mail order or about
$1000 list.

Benchmarks also to come.

Subject: File system redundancy

Boy am I glad the Amiga file system is redundant.  Let me relate a
story . . .

Saturday morning I was doing some complicated macro hacking in
micrognuemacs, when, unbeknownst to me, I accidentally overwrote
a very important file on one of my floppies.  Let me say that this
file was extremely important, that I had been building it over
the past two years, and no monetary value could be placed on it.

That afternoon I went back to add something to the file, when I
noticed the catastrophe.  Shit, said I.  And then some other
choice swear words.  Then I went to a movie to think about my
life without that file.

But the hacker in me would not give up.  So, I write protected and
made several copies of the diskette, and then tried to recover
the file with some of the many disk editor programs on the Fish
disks.  I couldn't get the file back with any of them.  Disksalv
failed because the disk was hunky-dory, and the file was so large
that I couldn't patch the pieces back together with a disk editor.

So, I wrote a small program which simply dumped to an ASCII file
the contents of every block on that disk that didn't have the
contents of a freshly formatted disk.  I then wrote another program
which pieced as many fragments of each file together as it could,
and wrote them all out to disk.  These programs took about an hour
to write.

Well, I ran them, and after a little debugging, I had about eight
`files' in my RAM disk.  I examined them one by one, and wallah
:-) one of them was my original file, completely intact.  This was
only possible because of all the redundancy; pointers to the next
block in each block, pointers back to the original file block, and
sequence numbers.

So my life goes on, all hunky-dory, and I continue to work.  And
once again I learn the importance of backups, by not having one.

Subject: Info on LA50 switch settings.

SW1-1 thru SW1-4 define the character set.  All 4 open means U.S. ASCII.
SW1-5 is graphics aspect ratio.  Open is 144 dpi, closed is 180 dpi.
SW1-6 and SW1-7 define protocol.  Both open means to use XON/XOFF.
SW1-8 is right margin.  Open means stay at column 80, closed starts new line.
The factory setting is all SW1 switches open.

SW2-1 thru SW2-3 define the baud rate. OOO=4800, OOC=3600, OCO=2400,
  OCC=1200, COO=600, COC=300, CCO=200, CCC=110.  Fastest when all open.
SW2-4 thru SW2-6 define data bits and parity.  OCC=7O, CCC=7E, OOC=7M, COO=7S,
  OCO=8O, CCO=8E, OOO=8N (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).
SW2-6 and SW2-7 are not documented.  SW2-6 is closed and SW2-7 is open.
The factory setting is all SW2 switches open except for SW2-7.

The LA50 is usually set up for 4800 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit,
XON/XOFF flow control, US ASCII character set.

Hi,

I guess I can not really keep my mouth shut. I got myself convinced that
I really could not live in only one MB anymore (my excuse was that
Prolog (see other msg), Latex, and some big Icon stuff could not run in
a 1MB machine) . So I have went down to HT, and got the subsystem for my
a500, and put in a 2MB Micron board. When I decided to get it, I did
not realize what it would do to my amiga. The whole C: in ram, together
with editor and a collection of other utils. Having space to run wiconify.
My shiny new 3MB a500 flies. I can barely release the left-amiga/escape
key before popcli puts a new window up. Now this is fun.

Oh well, but it really made a much greater difference than I expected.

Subject: Help - how do I print a "g"?

Hi,

I kow that I have asked before, but I find it har to beleive that I
am the only one who have come across this problem.
If I print pictures from DPAINT, some fancy aspect calculations are
done, so that the picture on the paper looks a lot like that on the
screen (if I had a colour printer) - this is really fine for art.

However, I sometimes want to make a generic computer science illustration
(Boxes, circles, arcs, and some text). This I do in only black/white
hires. But when I print such a picture, this is what happens: text
get messed up because some pixels are not square (in order to get the
right aspect) The following showed what happend to a `g':

printed `g', and expected `g'


   *** ***         *** **
  **  ***         **  **
  **  ***         **  **
  **  ***         **  **
  **  ***          ****
   ****          **   **
***   ***         *****
  *****
  *****

and a small box comes out messed up too:
printed:         expected:
******               *****
**   *               *   *
**   *               *   *
**   *               *   *
******               *****
******


There seems to be three solutions to this problem:
1) Someone has a program that prints `uniform' pixels
2) I make a program that prints uniform pixels.
3) I ask someone if I can borrow their Mac :-(

Hope someone can help me with 1)

Subject: March 1988 BADGE info

March 1988 BADGE (Bay Area Amiga Developers' Group) meeting will be held
in Turing Auditorium at Stanford campus.  The meeting is scheduled to
begin at 8:15pm.

The featured speaker for the March 1988 meeting is Jim Mackraz, who will
present the "Beta Version" of the talk he will be giving at the Developers'
Conference in April.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIAL NOTE: there is a possibility of a SECOND MEETING during the last
week of March featuring Rich Miner from the University of Lowell.  Meeting
times will be posted. Following is an excerpt from Rich's letter:

-- From Rich Miner --
"I will be heading out west in late March for NCGA and the Electronic
Imaging Show.  ...  We have built a 35-MIPS Parallel Coprocessor for
the Amiga and are also working on a Hi-Res graphics card that I could
talk about.  In fact I will be giving talks at the Electronic Imaging
show and at Lawrence Livermore Labs on the Amiga as a
High-Performance, low cost, parallel imaging workstation.  I would
also be willing to talk about this and give a presentation ... I would
focus on the design of our co-processor and its integration with the
Amiga environment as a powerful parallel coprocessor, none of this
8086 coprocessor bull :-) I could bring out a board and give a live
Demo.  For a brief write-up look in the January Amiga World in one of
the news sections toward the front.  I could also give a preview-talk
on the 1024x800x10 TMS-34010-50 based graphics card we have designed
and are building for the A2000."

Subject: Commodore announcements, from USENET...


TITLE: 1988 CEBIT Show Announcements

With over 500 members of the press in attendance, Commodore held a
press conference the first day of CEBIT (3/16/88). Chairman Irving Gould
took this opportunity to announce the continuation of the company's
successful financial picture. For the 6 month period ending 12/31/87,
net income rose to $34 million, up from $25.5 million in the same period
one year ago.  This represents an increase of 33%.  Mr. Gould stated that
80% of the net income came from products not present in the Commodore
line 2 years ago.

Mr. Gould announced the redesign of the PC line, and the further develop-
ment of the Amiga computer family. Plans for the Amiga 2500 and Amiga 3000
were discussed. Mr. Gould STRESSED "the A2000 will remain compatible with
all new attributes of new Amiga products".

Details of new products are:

AMIGA 2500AT will have the following specifications:

		68020/68881
		286 Bridgeboard
		40 MG Autoboot harddrive

AMIGA 2500UX will be equipped with

		68020/68881
		Autoboot Hardrive (with option of 100 MG harddrive)
		Unix 5.3 compatible operating system

The Unix included with the A2500UX is a proprietary high performance
windowing user shell. Also optional for the A2500UX will be a tapestream
storage device.

It was also announced that Commodore is continuing work on the Amiga 3000,
which will be based on Motorola's 68030 chip. Some of the attributes of
this machine include networking capabilities and multiple mass storage
devices of up to 2.2 gigabytes.  Release of the A3000 is slated for
calendar year 1989.

Other new products also shown at the Commodore booth include:

	A2620		68020/68881/68851 coprocessor for the A2000
	 		                    with 2-4 MG RAM
	A2024		High Resolution Gray Scale Amiga Monitor
	A2300		Amiga 2000 Genlock
	A2286 		80286 based Amiga bridgeboard
			Transputer project

In other news from the press conference:

Commodore announced a cooperative effort with a large scale research
group to develop a high performance workstation.  The West German Society
for Biotechnological Research and Commodore are working together to
develop the workstation which will be based on the Amiga 2000 with
Transputer. The workstation is aimed at the chemical, pharmaceutical
and food industries, and is considered ideal conditions for graphics
applications and display of molecular structures.

Chairman Gould announced no plans for Commodore to increase prices due
to DRAM  price increases. We will continue to supply our market at prices
levels now in effect.

It was also announced that enchanced graphics chips with non-interlace
mode will be available for the Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000.

Commodore is the leader in the West German microcomputer industry, with
a market share of over 50%. With professional systems, Commodore ranks
in 2nd place in Germany, and is unchallenged in the home market.

European press reaction to the conference has been very positive. Some
of the headlines from the show include: "Commodore and Nixdorf Grow,
Grow, Grow" and "Commodore Attacks the Professional and Business Market".

Commodore and, more especially, CATS, want to thank you as developers for
your ongoing support.  It is this support which has made the advancements
possible.

Hoping to see all of you in Washington -

			Lauren

Subject: help! kermit problems


With the impending demise of sushi, I thought it wise to offload everything
of use onto floppies, but whenever I try to use kermit, I get nowhere.
The symptoms are that my local kermit times out whenever I try to get a
file.  Furthermore, when I tell the remote to FINISH, it just hangs up
(I presume that eventually it would time out, but I get impatient and
reboot).  Is this a problem with kermit on the dec-20, with my copy of
kermit, or with the user?  Help!  (and fast, too).  Much thanks.  -eric

Subject: Second BADGE meeting for March


Accoring to a posting from USENET, the second BADGE meeting for March
is going to happen this Thursday (3/31), at the regular time & place
(Turing Auditorium, 8:15pm). Rich Miner from the Univ of Lowell CPE
Imaging Research Lab will be talking about the 35 MIPS parallel
coprocessor built for the Amiga. (He might even give a demo!) See you all
there!

ps. Because sushi is going away, this newsgroup will move over to
Score, probably starting later today or tomorrow... You can post to
AMIGA@Sushi for another few days, but because Sushi is going away for
good, your postings will go to the bit bucket after this week... Starting
tomorrow, please post to AMIGA@Score. Thank you for your support.

Subject: Printing problems solved!!!




After seaching around I have finally found a printing program that
will not mix up my pictures, but prints it just the way I want it to.

If anyone is intersted in this ultimate printing program, I can mail
you a copy. It asks for a modest $5 shareware fee.

Subject: Question from a Novice

Hi folks,

I'm trying to fool around with the Amiga's multitasking.  I have a
bunch of tasks running which finish their jobs before their time slices
are used up, so they sit busy-waiting (bad).  I want to have each task
check to see if it has done as much useful work as it can, then put itself
to sleep so other tasks can have a crack at the cpu.

I just want the tasks to sleep until the scheduler decides it's time to
run the task again.  I don't want to wake up the task with a message
or anything like that.

So far as I can tell from the documentation I have, I would want to
put a Wait(mask) in my task code, where <mask> is 32 bits, the 16 hi
bits being used by the system and the lo 16 bits being used by moi.
Since I don't want to do anything fancy I don't need to worry about
the lower 16, but I can't find any description of the upper 16.  Can I
just give Wait a mask with all 16 hi bits set to 1, and all 16 lo bits set
to 0s?  I assume one of those upper 16 is the signal bit for "wake up
task because it's your turn again".

Will this work?  Also where can I find out what these upper 16 bits are
used for, exactly?

Damon

Well, folks, I messed up again; apparently ventilating fans and
audio were left on in Turing last Thursday after BADGE.  (Does
anyone know where the ventilating fans are?)  I need someone who
is willing to stay at Turing after BADGE until everyone is gone,
and verify that *everything* is turned off.  Apparently I can't
handle it, as this is the third time this has happened, and I think
the Turing people might be getting just a little angry with us.
Volunteers?

Subject: Smooooth scrolling? - how to?

Hi,

I wanted to write a little game. In that little game I wanted a background
to scroll smoothly to the left. It prooved to be more difficult than I
hoped for. Here is what I did, but it is utterly slow.

I make an off-screen rasterport to draw into, so that I should not have to
scroll the rasterport on the screen (I use a HIRES 16 color screen - to big?)

My scroll loop looks like this
	Scroll of screen rasterport 1 to the left
		Using the build in rasterscroll.
	Draw one vertical line of new background.
	Copy the off-screen raster to the Screen raster
		Using the BltBitMapRasterPort procedure.


This came out hopelessly slow, so what do I do?
- Take a low res low color screen
- Use bltbitmap directly (is there any win here)
- Apply amiga-guro trick #71.4 for smooth scrolling backgrounds, only I
  do not know that trick.

The Fish disk lists have been moved from <ali.amiga.fish> on Sushi to
<ali.amiga.fish> on Score. There you'll find files named 1, 2, 3, ... 138
that contain info about the contents of each disk and a large file named
WHEREIS that is a master index (sorted by program name). You can freely
FTP these files and print them out...

[Actually the lists don't go up to disk 138 yet --- the newest batch (129..138)
 still needs to be added to the list. As Max Toy said last night at FAUG, this
 will happen "soon."]

Subject: Inexpensive Computer Products



I hope people won't mind that this message is an advertisement, but it
is also a great opportunity for you to get Amiga accessories safe and
cheap (check end of message on incredible 3.5" floppy offer).

I just started a small company called ISKAN which takes orders from anyone
for computer hardware and software accessories, then will purchase the
product from a manufacturer or distributor and charge whoever ordered it
a fee which will cover cost, expenses (shipping, phone), tax and a
very modest profit margin.

These prices will be less expensive than or at least the same as
mail-order prices.  In addition, you get free delivery within the Stanford,
Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Mountain View areas.  The company will also take
care of all warranty repairs.  The company will handle non-warranty repairs,
but it will probably be slower than taking it to an authorized service
center.

The company takes orders for all accessories and even some computers.  An
example of the inexpensive price is the STARBOARD2 2 meg expansion for
299 dollars.  Also as an introductory offer, you can get 3.5" floppy
disks for 1 dollar each.

To order from ISKAN or just for general information, call 854-1461.
Leave your name, number and product you're interested in if you get
an answering machine.  Someone will get back to you within 24 hours.

Subject: Digitizing, anyone? 


Computer Science Dept just purchased Perfect Vision, the real-time
digitizer. The software has some problems (and will crash under certain
predictable situations), but other than that the product is pretty nice.
You can digitize 16-gray pictures in 1/60th of a second, and you can
digitize images from a VCR! (It'll also do color from VCR, apparently, when
a color seperator box becomes available to in between the digitizer and
the VCR.)

Anyway, at Tresidder with the digitizer we have a pretty nice VCR/camcorder
(capable of zooming into less than an inch). If any of you would like to
get anything digitized, let me know and we can arrange to meet at
Tresidder. You can even digitize stuff off a VHS video tape.

At Fashion Island the Computer Spectrum of Burlingame is holding an
Amiga/Atari "World Class Expo." Not a big expo by most standards, but the
admission is free, and there are stuff on sale... Most prices are average,
except for the Amiga 500 price: The Amiga 500 is $500, which is below
local dealer averages... The 512K expansion is $149, the monitor is $299,
and the external floppy is $219 --- For a total full system price
of under $1200... Not bad in my opinion. So if you're thinking of buying
a 500 or know anyone who is, send them over there. Tomorrow (May 1st) is
the last day.

They also have the 2000 for $1449. Extra 2 Megs for $349. Not too bad!

Hi!  I was using DFC from a recent Fish disk and it got guru number
81000005.00C3844A (Exec: corrupted memory list).  All I did was to use
it to copy 3 disks from DF0 to DF2, then toggle 'verify' off and back on,
then toggle 'memory' on and back off.  Sorry, I was unable to reproduce
the problem.  I'm running an A2000 with 1 meg (and approx 100K in RAM:).

Subject: Sending CLI output to the printer. 

On my Amiga, I need to do something just like typing Control-P to CP/M or
MS-DOS.  That is, everything I type has to be output to both the screen and
the printer, and the output from programs go to both the screen and the
printer.  Using redirection doesn't cut it since input from the keyboard
does not show up on the redirected output.

Is there a console handler out there that can do this?

Two new things in <ali.amiga.misc> on Score: dmouse & virusx 1.21

Dmouse, Matt Dillon's latest creation, provides mouse acceleration, 
mouse blanking, single-click window ordering, and screen blanking.
Work with acceleration factor of 3 or 5 for a while and any other mouse
seems terribly sloooow. And all you need is 2x2 inches of desk space!

Dmouse is in three files --- dmouse.uu, dmouse-handler.uu, and dmouse.doc.
Get them to you Amiga, uudecode them, and put dmouse-handler in the l:
directory. 

Virusx.uu has the "arc" version of the latest and apparently greatest
virus checker. I didn't test it myself, but it might be useful at some
point... This is version 1.21.

And, it's Wednesday night before the third Thursday of the month, and
no news of BADGE! This of course does not mean there won't be a meeting,
but be prepared for a no-speaker type gathering. Of course, this might
be the greatest chance to start up the discussions on the next 
BADGE Killer Demo Contest.

BADGE (Bay area Amiga Developers' GroupE) will host the first Rules' Committee
meeting for the 1988 BADGE Killer Demo Contest at 8pm, on Thursday, May 26,
in Turing Auditorium at Stanford University.

Randy Spencer (of Infinity Software) volunteered to be the Coordinator and,
from a show of hands, it appears the attendance will be large. Everyone
interested in contributing to the discussion is welcome. Bring your
suggestions regarding categories, "special equipment needed", etc.

The goal of the contest is to collect exciting demos for the Amiga
computer and give them wide distribution throughout the Amiga
community.  Last year's Zeroth BADGE Killer Demo Contest, held in
October 1987, was a huge success --- The winning demos were displayed
at Amiga dealer windows everywhere, and the authors won various prizes
and worldwide fame among Amiga owners.

Mail-System-Version: <SUN-MM(242)+TOPSLIB(128)@CSLI.Stanford.EDU>

Hello there - I was wondering if someone would have an answer to
a problem I just came across.  It goes like this:
I opened a window for a disk and a window for one of the drawers
in the first window.  I removed an icon from inside the drawer's
window and placed it on the workbench screen.  I then closed all
windows and double-clicked the icon to run the program.
After finishing with the program I thought - is there going to be
a problem with this icon being here?  Will it have been removed
from the disk if I power down now?  That seemed unlikely, but anyway
I opened the disk's window and dragged it on top of its drawer
to see what would happen.  It disappeared and I heard no disk access.
Today I opened this drawers window again and the icon was gone.
I did a dir in CLI and it as well as its .icon are there in the
right directory, but don't show up in the wb window.  The window's
scroll bars are full size, so it's not in a different place in
the window it's just gone.
It runs fine from CLI.
What happened?
Thanks,
 -Harry

1.3 will be available when the people developing it and the Commodore
QA people are satisfied that it is essentially bug free.  At the
moment, this is not the case (although it's real close!)  It will be
available from your local dealers and will probably be cheap.  If I
*had* to guess when it would be available, I'd say sometime in July.

And it will be worth many times what they will charge . . .

Thanks everyone who responded to my question about why my icon
disappeared from its wb drawer.
Michael Frank gave me some suggestions to try, but half way through
his first suggestion, -poof- the icon was back.
Now I'm _really_ puzzled.
What I did was list the directory to see the .info was there and was
reasonably long (it was).  Load it into IconEd to see that it looked
ok (it did).  Make a copy of it using CLI copy to a.info.  Then, I
opened the drawer from the wb to see if "a" was there - and it was...
on top of the original icon.  I don't know what brought the original
back, but I just deleted a.info and everything's normal now.
Try as I may I just cannot duplicate this problem.
So I'd still be quite interested if anyone has any ideas what could
have happened.  Thanks again,
 -Harry

some killer demos.  The rewards consist of cold hard cash, recognition
throughout the Amiga community, and some neat toys.

Last years winners included Joel Hagen, Ken Offer, Robert Wilt,
Leo Schwab, and Mark Riley.  Some of the prizes from last year
included an Amiga 2000, ASDG 8 Meg Memory board, Microbotics Starboard II,
Manx C compiler, and 3 year subscriptions to Info magazine.

Last years winning demos were distributed to dealers and in the 
Fred Fish Freely Distributable Library disks 112 - 127.

This year we are doing it again...

Two catagories:   Custom Programs / Tool Based demos

Environment:   1 meg machine, 2 floppies, WorkBench 1.3 running

In-reply-to: your message of Sat, 28 May 88 12:18:40 PDT

The .fastdir files are created by CLImate.  If you only use CLImate's gadgets
to do CLI type activities and don't use the CLI, then the .fastdir files
are supposed to match the disk directory, therefore CLImate does not have
to read the header block of every file in the directory.  I tend to destroy
them wherever they are.     /Joe

Subject: modems 

I want to get a modem that works for my Amiga 500.  I planned on
buying a Supra 2400 for $139 from the company mentioned on
comp.sys.amiga. Unfortunately, they now charge $155 instead of $139
and charge $2.50 for shipping. Is this still a good deal?

Can you recommend a lower price 1200 or 2400 baud modem?

Thanks in advance,
James

<ali.amiga.fish>139-146 on Score. (Soon to be broken up into files
named 139, 140, 141, etc.) Looks like there are some good stuff on there;
two-disk Stony Brook Prolog distribution, a Small-C (subset of C) compiler,
and "RIM," a relational information manager...

Also reminder: FAUG meeting is tonight (first Tuesday of the month) at
7:00pm, at Palo Alto Hyatt.

What is actually you set when you go into the preferences and set the
printer parameters. If I set a leftmargin of 5, only some programs
starts to print with a left margin of 5. Is it left for the programmer

that is the case why was such parameters put ito the preferences anyway?

I've already asked this on USEnet, but I really need an answer fast ...

Is there any reason why a program that works on an Amiga with an '020 
would not work on an Amiga with an '020 *and* 32-bit memory?

I've gotten some vague reports from beta-testers along these lines and 
I'd like to know if there are any differences as far as software should 
be concerned.  My understanding was that this type of change to the 
hardware is completely transparent to the programmer.  Thanx in advance.

Subject: Library Source 

Hi.

I'm looking for examples of how to create a run-time library using Manx 3.6a
C compiler.  If there are sources I can get on-line here that's great, but
pointers like Fish disk #X would also be Ok.  Also, has anyone implemented
a library base locking protocol, or seen the source to LockIBase() in
Intuition?  While source examples for a library are essential, it would also
help to know the general rules involved as well.  Many of the basic rules I
can take an educated guess at, but I imagine that there are some tricky things
that only someone who has actually done it would know.  Any help would be
appreciated.  Thanx in advance.

What happened to the INFO-AMIGA digest?  I've heard two stories: one says the
moderator of the digest gave up and INFO-AMIGA died, the other says that
INFO-AMIGA is just a reposting of comp.sys.amiga from USENET.  Are either or
both statements true?  I would want to get on the INFO-AMIGA mailing list
if it is different from comp.sys.amiga.

info-amiga did indeed die. It used to be a diest, but the moderator gave
up because of the heavy workload. About six months ago I started
dumping comp.sys.amiga from polya to the tragedies, into the "info-amiga" bboard.
Other than the name, the info-amiga bboard on lots has nothing to do with the

Subject: VSO 

It's that time of the year again, when we need all of the Amiga
type Stanford students to come forward and be counted!  We need
another few signatures to be eligible for VSO privileges this
year again, so if you are a student with an Amiga, or just
interested in the Amiga, please give me a call at 326-5312 so we
can get this form filled out.  Or simply stop by 072 CIS (on the
second floor).  If I'm not there, the form will be in some obvious
place; simply sign your name and student ID number in the
appropriate slots.

	The program you want is called HardCopy.  It is found on 
	Fish Disk #75 with the source in C so that you can change it
	to do what you want.  It currently does what the PHOTO did on
	the old Decsystem-20's,  logging all terminal I/O to a file to
	print later, while still letting you see the prompts.

Subject: Got BlitLab 

Thanks for sending me BlitLab - it arrived Tuesday morning.

The manual was well written, but there are a few things you might
want to add.

  1) On page Blitter-6, "...+A~A~B+..." should be "...+A~B~C+...".
  2) Same page, near "A+B", add "The quickest way to clear out that
     big long formula is to select anywhere within the function
     string gadjet, then hold the right Amiga key and press the 'X' key."
  3) On page Blitter-9, just before the heading "Copying Arbitrary Regions",
     add "Be sure to toggle 'DESC' back to '(desc)' before proceeding."

Again, thanks for the wonderful examples.

Here's a message about 1.3 from Carolyn Scheppner (of Commodore)... 
amiga.dev/main #4248, from cscheppner, 758 chars, Fri Sep 16 11:11:28 1988
Comment(s).
----------

TITLE:	>>>  1.3 Released to Production   <<<

   I have been asked to make the announcement that 1.3 Workbench and Extras
have been released to Production.  I can't supply a date on when Enhancer
kits will be in the stores or available through CATS, but the manuals are
being printed right now, so you should be seeing them quite soon.

   I will be uploading the few files which changed between Omega 9 and
Release to amiga.com and amiga.update listings areas as soon as I get myself
a copy of Release.

   We would like to thank all of our developers who participated in the
Beta/Gamma/Omega-testing of 1.3, especially those who provided quick and
valuable feedback by downloading and using each version as it was posted to
the closed listings areas.

We still need one more student signature for the Voluntary Student
Organization, or we won't have BADGE this year.  Anyone back on
campus yet?  Stop by CIS 072 (second floor) and sign the application
on my desk.  Thanks!                                         -tom

Hi there.
	I was wondering if anybody knew where I could get some
source code that acts as a template for adding a task to the
system when a diskette is inserted or ejected.  Can someone
help me out?  Thanks.
