Subject: "On F23, capacity exceeded" simply"... 

On F23, "frame capacity exceeded" simply means that too many people are
trying to login at the same time.  It is not a reason for crashing the
system, it means that the idle-job kill time needs to be reduced, or
that SRA should attempt to move some users and applications off of F23.

System 23 is so overloaded that it will always run up against one or more
of the following limits:
  1) The number of files that can be open at the same time by all jobs
     on the system.  Each MAGNUM job opens a lot of files.
  2) The amount of free-core.  When this is exceeded, most jobs get stuck
     in an 'FC' wait.  The system gets wedged and has to be rebooted.
  3) The frame capacity.  When this limit is reached, no new jobs can
     login.  The operator has to kill some idle jobs to make room for
     new ones.  Hitting this limit is the least damaging of the three.

It does not look like system 23's problems are going to get any better
until some of its load is reduced.
