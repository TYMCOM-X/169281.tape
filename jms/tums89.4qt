There were eight nodes on the list for conversion last night, although
actually one node was double scheduled both on Oct. 27th and 31st (it was 
successfully converted on the 27th), therefore, seven nodes were scheduled.

Four were successfully converted, one (N2074) was missing slots 1, 2 and 3,
and two were not attempted since they are 6.35 Isis Consat which is still
under certification tests.

Joe;

On system 26, can you turn off the bit that reports users whose UFD
reports as bad files?

The users are ITANET, TELCODE, NCF, SOURCE, ALCODES, and STEINISM.

Thanks Rick

THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE WE EXPERIENCE WHEN SEELING INTO AN IBM ENVIRONMENT
HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THIS YEAR SINCE TELENET INTRODUCED THEIR 
MULTI-DROP PLUS PRODUCT.  FOR MARIAN HASTY, SOUTHEAST DISTRICT SR. SALES
REPRESENTATIVE, THIS TELENET THREAT MERELY PROVIDED HER ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO 
USE HER CREATIVE SOLUTION ORIENTED SELLING APPROACH.

FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS MARIAN HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY SELLING SMALL PIECES OF 
BUSINESS INTO HARRIS CORPORATION OUT OF MELBOURNE, FL.  HARRIS SEMICONDUCTOR
HOWEVER, HAS BEEN ONE DIVISION MARIAN HAS HAD TROUBLE SELLING INTO THIS YEAR
BECAUSE OF THE LARGE INSTALLED BASE OF MULTI-DROP PLUS SERVICE.  WHEN MARIAN
FOUND A NEW APPLICATION BEING DEPLOYED WITH A TIME FRAME SO STRINGENT TELENET
COULDN'T GET THEIR LEASE LINES INSTALLED FAST ENOUGH, SHE KNEW SHE HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY.  QUICKLY, SHE WAS ABLE TO SELL A 19.2 NETWORK CONNECTION AND
CMT/3270 SNA WHICH COULD MEET THEIR TIME FRAME.  FOR HARRIS THIS WOULD BE A 
TEMPORARY SERVICE UNTIL THEY COULD PURCHASE SDLC CARDS AND GET THE TELENET
LEASED LINES INSTALLED.  

MARIAN AND CS MARIE DOYLE QUICKLY TEAMED WITH MARK DE LA VEGA, ANNA VETRANO,
AND PAUL CORCORAN TO COME UP WITH A COMPETITIVE LONG TERM SOLUTION.  THE
TEAM DETERMINED THAT 9.6 ASYNC PRIVATE ACCESS PORTS (CURRENTLY NOT A
PRODUCT) CONFIGURED FOR A FLAT MONTHLY RATE, COULD BE THE TICKET.  THE
TEAM WAS EXACTLY RIGHT.  THIS WEEK MARIAN RECEIVED AN ORDER FOR TWO 19.2
CMT/SNA NETWORK CONNECTIONS AND 47 9.6 PRIVATE ACCESS PORTS, WITH A ONE
YEAR ETA.  NOT ONLY HAS MARIAN WON A COMPETITIVE PIECE OF BUSINESS OVER
TELENETS MULTI-DROP PLUS, SHE'S SECURED A $ 30K PER MONTH ACCOUNT
FOR A MINIMUM ONE YEAR TERM.

A SPECIAL THANKS TO MARIE DOYLE, MARK DE LA VEGA, ANNA VETRANO, AND PAUL
CORCORAN WHOM WITHOUT THIS SALE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.

In reference to doing the add-pack on F23:

There is a problem in the monitor when adding two packs at the same time.
To be safe, please do the following:

	Starting at ONCE, go into the FILES dialog.
	ADD the first pack.
	Type GO to leave FILES and got back to ONCE.  (This updates the disk)
	Go back into the FILES dialog and add the second pack.
	Continue as normal.

The step of leaving FILES after adding just the first pack is required to
make sure that all the system structures are properly updated.

I will be on-call during that time if you have any questions.

Subject: Transfer of WALLING or RIVERS: CHAVEZ to CHAVEZ 

I don't understand how SETOP is allowig a transfer of an individual from
a specific manager back to that same manager... I think this situation is
the problem.  SETOP should NOT allow a stupid transfer form/to the same
manager.

In terms of the bad pointer, it seems that PANGILINA used to report to
SCAROTHERS or OROURKE used to report to CHAVEZ and when one of these was
transferred, the pointer was not fixed up.

I'd rather not "regenerate" the pointers, (writing on a mapped file) if it
is NOT necessary, maybe I can verify the back pointers and fix it only if
it is incorrect.  I will also check the transfer code.  Apparently, that
could be causing the back pointer slip.  sic PANGILINA/OROURKE.

Subject: System 23 very slow. 

It's Thursday afternoon and system F23 is very slow.
SYSTAT says that the amount of virtual memory in use is 408% of physical
memory.  With all the magnum jobs running, 2 megs of memory is not enough.
If this sort of load continues, then F23 realy needs 4 meg of memory.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
CAD/CAM
    o    Kathryn Rebe and I met with SUN's software specialist and
         his manager in Milpitas.  During our tour of their
         facility we exchanged information about our support
         operations and plans.

    o    I attended the National Computer Graphics Association's
         CAD/CAM conference in Santa Clara.  This poorly attended
         conference provided me the opportunity to collect some
         valuable information through one-on-one conversations with
         people in the know from D.E.C., Tektronix, Evans and
         Sutherland, and others.

    o    Bob Henchell and I met with Brenda Downs of DAC to discuss
         FSCO maintenance of their SUN hardware and software.

    o    We received our copy of SUN's "Field Engineer's Handbook"
         and delivered it to our Documentation Department for
         distribution.

    o    We completed the revised Support Plan for Sun
         Microsystems.  Preliminary copies have been distributed
         for review prior to approval.

    o    The first update to the "Hardware Quick Reference Manual"
         has been distributed to the field.  Another update is near
         completion.

    o    Dave Murillo assisted Chris Coleman of our local field
         office in performing a very complicated local area 
         Vax Cluster/Unigraphics installation at Northrop.

    o    CSC Engineering is now receiving SUN software support
         through MDFSCO.  A final contract has not been signed as
         we are still developing an acceptable contract amendment
         form.

    o    Larry Henley, Dane Morinaka, and Joe Smith completed the
         installation of two SUN systems for MDNSC in Santa Ana.



    o    Dave Murillo completed the software upgrade on our
         Microvax and Kathryn Rebe completed the Unigraphics
         installation on our Sun 4/370.

    o    We investigated reported problems with the RAM-00733
         boards for the Megatek ECO.  Our conclusion is that these
         problems appear to be an isolated case and should not
         cause additional delays in the ECO program.

    o    This department assisted with 79 calls this month.

IPC SUPPORT

    o    Joe Smith and I visited TRW to address software and
         hardware problems with their two tape drives connected to
         their DEC 2020.  Joe has engineered one software patch for
         this system and will investigate other software problems.

    o    Joe is continuing to assist MDNSC with the SUN conversion
         project.  Activity has slowed on this program due to a
         handshaking problem which is causing high failure rates on
         microcode loads.


PLANS:

    o    Approval of the revised SUN Support Plan is expected this
         month.

    o    Dave Murillo will be attending the DECUS Symposium during
         the week of November 6.

    o    First customer ship of Unigraphics on SUN is scheduled for
         this month.

    o    An offer will be extended to an experienced F.E. against
         Requisition #B1111.

    o    I will be visiting MDM&E with Peter Gorr to discuss SUN
         hardware and software maintenance.


CONCERNS:

    o    The number of calls from ill-prepared F.E.'s appears to be
         rising.  Some recent issues include F.E.'s onsite without
         a meter, with too few hand tools, having no documentation,
         completing no training.  We will be working to quantify
         the impact of such problems.

    o    We share a concern with Field Support regarding too many
         major unit swaps.  The orders for entire Megatek chassis'
         and color monitors appears unusually high.  We have been
         told that other major units (disk and tape drives) are
         also being replaced at an alarming rate.  Some further
         investigation and, perhaps, a policy change may be needed.

The cracks aren't in my way, the CHP is.
Even though I don't need to go through the slide
area to get to my exit, they force everyone to sit
in a long line of traffic for upwards of 45 minutes
while they form a 30-60 line and then lead them through.

Bleh!
The aftershocks up there are a LOT more noticeable
and get on your nerves quite a bit. But so far everything
is still where it should be.

Subject: re: Kjob & OP ... HU 

Well,
   OP and HU are the only applicable licenses from the list.  SY may be needed
so you can see who it is you're killing, otherwise you're blind.

   OP lets you do things to the system, like run HANGUP, CHKPNT... but not
necessarily do anything to users.  It's LOGOUT's perogative as to what is
needed to kill jobs, since it runs with JL (KJOB calls LOGOUT) and LOGOUT
apparently doesn't honor HU (assuming that your observation is correct about
HU not being enough).  What you have should be enough to kill other operator
jobs.

  AS (not a license, just a privilege bit) enables you to kill jobs in your
same GAN (project).

  HU (a pseudo license) you only have if you enter an oper password to the
program, or some similar event, so it's nothing special... you don't have it
just because you set license since it is NOT real.

  To kill any (repeat ANY) job, you need WC, as that's what's necessary to do
operations such as you want on another frame.  EVICT on the other hand (may)
but I think not... without WC.

  TAKEIT has WC already and may do things in your behalf because of OP, but
in general, OP is not enough, and HU is fairly useless.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
CAD/CAM
    o    Sun/Unigraphics installations have begun.  As expected, we
         are finding (and documenting) several gotcha's with the
         provided installation instructions.

    o    John Swarbrick, Larry Fox, and I had an initial conference
         with Sun.  We agreed that we must consider all options as
         we look toward the future.  We expect to have a follow up
         discussion later this month.

    o    We welcome Tony Duran as the newest member of CAD/CAM
         Product Support.  His hardware and software expertise will
         bring much to the department.

    o    Marlene Ford and several members of this department,
         including myself, met with John Lee of MDM&E to discuss
         installation pricing.  We presented our initial outline of
         a proposed pricing matrix.  This plan has undergone much
         refinement by this department during the past several
         weeks and is near completion (see "PLANS").

    o    We invoiced MDNSC $1,761 for the installation of the Sun
         systems in Santa Ana.

    o    BMY's D2300 is now running, but not in the original
         configuration.  After very much effort by this department,
         Technical Support, and Dennis Knorr's district we proved
         that the RS232 problems can be duplicated on a remote
         D2300 and the hardware operates under Ethernet.  MDM&E now
         has ownership of the problem while MDFSCO has loaned the
         customer an Ethernet controller.

    o    We completed making up the forms for MDFSCO provided Sun
         support.  MDCSC is filling in the required information and
         will become our first customer.


CAD/CAM (Continued)
    o    The second update to the "Hardware Quick Reference Manual"
         has been distributed to the field.

    o    Larry Henley has completed Version 1.0 of the Remex paper
         tape reader/punch diagnostic.  After a brief field
         evaluation it will be made available to FE's via the
         VAXCOMS support system.

    o    The following installation procedures have been documented
         and made available on the VAXCOMS system this month:
         -    Remote and Local Screen Dump on Hewlett Packard.

         -    101 were hardware related
         -     37 were software related
         -     14 calls (or 10%) were resolved with readily

IPC SUPPORT

    o    Joe Smith assisted in the diagnosis of hardware problems
         at TRW.  As of this date TRW has been up for one full week
         without problems.

    o    Joe assisted (via phone) with a problem at National
         Research Labs in Washington D.C.

    o    Relating to the Sun conversion project at MDNSC, testing
         of a new version of the BITS program has begun.  It
         appears that microcode loads are much more successful but
         there are still problems.  It is unclear if there will be
         further delays in the project schedule.


PLANS:

    o    Approval of the revised SUN Support Plan, expected last
         month, was delayed by logistics.  The concern is that the
         sparing philosophy may not be fully understood by all
         parties.  Now that all players are back in town, we
         anticipate approval of Revision B of the Sun Support Plan
         within the next few weeks.

    o    We will be delivering an installation pricing proposal to
         MDM&E.

    o    The alignment procedure for D135 monitors will be released
         this month.

    o    We will be researching the reported problems with
         monochrome monitors on Sun systems and we hope to identify
         a more cost effective manner to repair them.

    o    The installation procedures for Sun's Operating System
         software will be distributed on the VAXCOMS system.


CONCERNS:

    o    As we continue to cross-train the field I am concerned
         that we may not be meeting our customers expectations,
         especially in the CAD/CAM market segment.  CAD/CAM
         customers are mechanical and/or electrical engineers who
         use our equipment to tackle complex engineering problems.
         As we further separate from MDM&E we also lessen our
         exposure to our customer's application, specifically M&E's
         software products.  While our training addresses the
         hardware aspects CAD/CAM workstations, our F.E.'s are
         often unaware of the customer's operation or his
         intellect.  The result, I fear, is that we sometimes
         appear incapable of properly addressing his problems.

         While I could elaborate with some examples I would prefer
         to limit my comments to a few suggestions.  
         1.   Instead of training a large field force across a
              broad range of products, I suggest we train a lesser
              number of Field Engineers, in depth, on specific
              products.  This must include advanced training
              outside our company in areas such as application
              software, communications, and power.

         2.   Develop programs which will encourage our field
              offices to share resources.  This may mean expanding
              the radius of some engineers so that product
              specialists will cross district boundaries to provide
              routine service.

         3.   Maintain this philosophy of specialization at every
              level, at every position, within our company.  Have
              sales specialists market service contracts during the
              warranty period.  Leave field managers to direct


CONCERNS: 
(Continued)

              their employees.  Let parts planners have
              responsibility for developing the spares philosophy
              and parts list for new products.  Etc.

         When applied, this philosophy becomes a "goal oriented"
         way of thinking in that each individual has the personal
         goal of becoming an expert in his field.  Each of us,
         then, can find satisfaction in knowing that whenever a
         member of our company meets one of our customers, that
         individual is an expert who will undoubtedly meet or
         exceed our customer's expectations.

In-reply-to: your message of Wed, 15 Nov 89 9:39:20 PST

ASP tapes can be used if the destination has the same number of total
pages.  Since there are the same number of pages on a 3650 as on one
logical unit of a 3652, it will work if DSKB is defined as 14 units
of 3650 disks (no more, no less).  After all the ASP tapes have been
restored, then you can do an ADD PACK (one unit at a time) to get
more space on DSKB.

One problem with moving system 34 is that a lot of software knows that
34 is the master system for certain files.  For instance, 34 is the
master for the oper password file (SETOP) and for (PJ)PAM.  I'm not
sure that we have sources to all the programs to be able to change
that.  I hope the plan is to move 58's users elsewhere, deassign host
58, move system 34 to 58's hardware.

Joe;

Sometime early next year, system 56 may be moved here to Fremont.

System 56 is presently running with a BLOCK monitor on 3330 dsk packs.

There are 18 logical units is use.

When the time comes fo this system to come here, I want to convert
it to a page monitor using ALL FILES and bring it up on 3650.

Will this system fit on two strings of 3650 with a page monitor?

Thanks Rick

Vida, I know you are validating users on the Unix systems using raw Unix tools.
I would like you and I and Joe Smith to sit down together and understand how 
we can make this easier for you. Please let me know your schedule for the 
week of 11 December so we can set a meeting time.

RE:     TYMNET ON TELEVISION!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TUNE INTO CBS NEWS SATURDAY NIGHT WITH CONNIE CHUNG, ON DECEMBER 16TH, AT 10:00
PM FOR THE CUCKOO'S EGG!!  CBS came to BT Tymnet Headquarters to film a portion
of the special program and to interview Steve White of the Vienna office. Steve
was one of the Tymnet employees involved in the pursuit of the international
ring of hackers. More on the Cuckoo's Egg is available in the December 11th
issue of People Magazine, the book is also available in book stores, and two
installments of the story were published in PC Computing Magazine September and
October Issues. This story illustrates one important reason why even the most
sophisticated hacker will get caught if they come across the TYMNET Network -
our people are incredibly dedicated!  Hats off to Wayne Bartlett, Director of
Security, Ron Vivier, and Steve White!

P.S. Because this is television, the air date can be rescheduled right up to the
last minute.  If this happens, look for another announcement with the new air
date....

RE:     TYMNET TELEVISION DEBUT LANDS ON CUTTING ROOM FLOOR!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Received the news today from the producer of CBS News Saturday Night with Connie
Chung - the TYMNET Network interview with Steve White has been edited out of the
program....aarrgghh!!  Apparently the editors had more tape than they could use,
so our section was cut out, even though the Cuckoo's Egg  has got no nest at all
without the TYMNET Network! Well, we'll know the whole story, even if Connie
Chung missed the point! That's show business......

Subject: Submit help 

Joe,

     I need some help with SUBMIT.  On system 56 I keep getting mail
that the Submit job for SYSDAT aborts.  I've tried rerunning it but
it won't keep going.  I don't understand what's wrong.

     Also, on system 74 I have a Submit job called ICP (#12024)
that won't seem to run.  But, the SAME Submit job on system 38 and
58 run just fine.  What's wrong?!


Thanks,
Landa/RPM

Subject: JMS on MUX 2096. 

Up until Monday morning, username JMS had been valid on MUX host 2096.
I had been using this MUX for my work on the Public Net Code Generation
systems; hosts F33, D25, D25, and the 6 Sun systems in Fremont.
Now is says "No room on this MUX for another non-validated user."

Is this a temporary restriction, or should I start making other plans?

If you are not the person to ask, please let me know who to talk to.

Subject: "Under UTIL there is a program"... 

Under UTIL there is a program called FLAGOF.SAV.  What would happen
if an Operator ran this on a System.

Can't find any documentation on what it does and what to do if it
was run.

We have someone here who is trying different things out without
knowing what he/she is doing.

Please respond as soon as possible.

Warmest wishes for the holidays.
