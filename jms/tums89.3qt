The mean time between failures for my modem has dropped to 10 minutes.
Pat Diamond says the Penril Cadet-2400 is a cheap design.  I guess I'm
lucky it lasted this long (what can you expect from excessed hardware).

I need to get a new external, Hayes compatible, 2400 baud modem right
away.  Who do I need to talk to for ordering one?

Joe;
Thanks for validating me on your Sun. I logged in tonight, and looked around a bit. I also did something I don't know what, but I think I was replying to some messages. I hope I didnt mess anything up. One problem I ran into, was that I am defined on the sun, as a vt100 terminal. I called from work where I have a hp2629 (Tym444) terminal, and I dont think I was able to see the messages I was trying to read. All I saw, was the MORE 21% prompt. Can you change my term to a TTY, oir a Tym444? How would I set term to a vt100 if I called from my Amiga at home? I hopI didnt mess up any files on the Sun. I was able to do a DIR, and saw a dead.letter there, it is probably the file I was in editor with. Thanks again for letting me use it. I'm sure I will try again tomorrow night.

Harry,

I used the node update shell and was suitably impressed.  I would appreciate
one small change though.  I would appreciate it if, when you mail the
backup request to pi, you could add $USER to the list.  We need this for
our own files.

Thanx,

Subject: "HELP TITO" reads (SYS)TITO.HLP 

I copied the old TITO.MEM to (SYS)TITO.HLP where the HELP program can read
it.  The way to restart a monthly save is:

	;Mount the last tape that was being used (for instance, #25)
	R TITO
	DIR P1		;This shows what (USER)FILE is in position 1
	REWIND
	NEW TAPE
	STORE ALL STARTING WITH (NEWPROD)
	25

This example shows restarting tape #25, starting with directory (NEWPROD).
The previous 24 tapes do not need to be redone.    /Joe

Subject: re: cartridge tape designators (sun-spots digest) 

The basic difference between QIC-11 and QIC-24 is that QIC-11 stores
one byte block numbers and QIC-24 stores 4 byte block numbers.  QIC-24
also defines an optional control block format which I don't think is
used and you wouldn't see anyway.  You probably want to use QIC-24.
Both formats are old, but QIC-11 is older and likelier to be forgotten
first.  (I recently bought some drives that could read QIC-24 but not
QIC-11.  This time I got that fixed.  Next time I won't bother.)

The MAILER started having problems Sunday night / Monday morning when it
noticed the mail for BRAHMB had not been read for 30 days (since 22-Jul).
It attempted to return-to-sender all 737 messages, and died with a SAIL
GC error (out of string space).  Once an hour the MAILER attempted to
restart the return-to-sender, and died each time, creating a 20,000 page
temporary file.

I have copied the original file (with 737 messages) to (BRAHMB)MAIL.OLD,
its size is 1076 disk pages.  New mail should arrive OK now.

Because of so many failures,oldest entry in (MAIL:74)LOG was for
Tuesday, 5-Sep-89 15:22 PDT.  From that time until Wednesday, 6-Sep-89 
12:08 PDT, there were 1556 occurances of "Creaux failed for BUBB".
Now that BUBB has been put back in the MUD, things are quiet.   /Joe

Each page is 2560 bytes = 2.5 Kbytes.
To convert pages to megabytes, take the number of pages and divide by 400.

F38 has 21 disks of 116550 pages each with 116447 pages free.
(21*116550)-116447 = 2,331,103 pages.
2331103 * 2560 / 1000000 = 5,967 megabytes.

         components (i.e. MDM&E and MDCSC), and support for new MDC
         customers (i.e. Teledyne).  With MDM&E's product release
         scheduled for September, sound planning and successful
         completion of these, and other, activities are essential.

Subject: Couldn't help this time. 

I got the call, but the question was about kadb, the kernel debugger.
Kadb is used to debug the unix kernel itself or a standalone program.
That's one subject I know nothing about, mainly be cause we (in San Jose)
don't have a source license, therefore no sources to the kernel.

Sorry I couldn't be of assistance.

Subject: SUBMIT JOB 

Joe,

I have a submit job running on system 54 and 25 (RUN25 and RUN54 in the
directory POSTECH).   I want to change the time the job is run from
0300 to 0330 (this job runs every day).  Is there any way to change this?
I tried using MODIFY but it seems that the DATES command can not be changed
this way (it did not appear to be one of the options).  

I would appreciate any help you could give me with this.  I have pulled
(SUBMIT)SUBMIT.DOC but it is a little confusing.  Is there any documentation
you can suggest that is geared towards the beginning SUBMIT user?

Thanks,

Geeti Bawa

Subject: RDIST PROGRAM 

Joe,

One other questions - When using the RDIST  program we are only able to
telecopy files from POSTECH:33 to POSTECH:54 and POSTECH:25.  Is there
any way to copy the files from POSTECH:33 to another directory on systems
54 or 25?  If not, is there any way the program can be modified to do so?

This would be invaluable to us - and a big savings of time and effort if
this could be done.

I would appreciate any comments you might have on this.

Thanks,

Geeti

In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 17 Aug 89 16:13:48 EDT

You cannot use RDIST to write into another user's directory since
the job running AUXMOX has no license.  However, you can pull files
from 33 by running RDIST on system 25 and have license there.  For example:

	RDIST (POSTECH)*.TYM/MASTER:33/HOST:25
	COPY ND2???.TYM,(TYMNET)SAME
	COPY ND3???.TYM,(TYMNET)SAME
	COPY ND4???.TYM,(TYMNET)SAME

This will work if you tell SUBMIT that the job should have license
when it is asking for "Options:".

Does that answer your question?

You can set "DATE EVERY DAY AT 03:30" from the "OPTIONS" prompt.
After you MODIFY your job this way, you can use the REQUEUE command
to force SUBMIT to recalculate the new next-run date.

In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 17 Aug 89 14:59:03 PDT

Joe,

I could not get the copy program to work with "wild-card" characters
(# and *).  Is there some way to do this?  Is there any way for RDIST
to run between the same system but different usernames (i.e. POSTECH
and TYMNET/TYM5).  I particularly like the function in RDIST that
runs the CKSUMs and only telecopies the files that are different.
The files that we want to transfer include a lot of BND files.  It seems
like a waste of system resources to copy files from POSTECH to TYMNET
if the checksum match (particularly as we would be doing it every night).

Any suggestions?

Geeti

F74 has been patched to P035/E-1.
This patch fixes the way the Monitor reads overflow blocks in the LUD.
This change, plus fixes to GFD and UPDLUD should allow more users to
be added to F74.    /Joe

Subject: Please zero out the prev pointer on PANGILINA in SETOP. 

PANGILINA is the first person under CHAVEZ, so the left pointer to OROURKE
is wrong.  If the real OROURKE is deleted, PANGILINA points to the empty
entry.  Then the next person to be defined (such as TEST) is screwed.
And we get an infinite loop when SETOP allows CHAVEZ to be transfered
to CHAVEZ.  It looks like you need to manually null out the bad pointer.
