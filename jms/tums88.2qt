o  X14 is back up with the same P/S.  Spare P/S would not work at all.
   So, Chuck put back the old one and made it work some how.  Base

Subject: SY related crashes F33 & F38 

  I say we are "in luck"... it appears that SY is not crashing the system
by peeking or spying with SYSDVF.  In fact, what appears to be happening
is SY does a FRMOP 1,addr trying to read the node-port of a frame and then
we see FILAMO or FILAUU ...  (FILAUU says ATB: Private pages for frame 985)
I forsee this as significant information but I don't know what Joe is trying
to print when we see this message.

  My guess is that there's a problem with dummy ATBs and keeping count if
sone number of users are trying to get/release something for a specific frame.

Subject: Strange zaps on MUX thru gateway. 

Around 11:20am today, my circuit to B39 got zapped.  I had logged in from
the MUX on host 2096 to username BUBB to JMS:39.  When I trie to login again,
the gateway said that host 39 was down.  However, when I tried 5 minutes later,
I got thru and the system had been up for 20 hours.  There were not a bunch
of detached jobs; the base had not crashed and the host had not crashed.
Osman had the same experience - for a short period of time he could not log
into 39 from the gateway, but people in Bubbnet had no problems.

Around 5:30pm, I was again zapped from the mux and could not get back for a
while.  When I did get thru, my previous job was still logged in and had a
port (it was not detached).  
SYSTAT said "4067(n1B3)" for both jobs, which is public net host 5981.
It looks like the portion of my circuit between the mux and the gateway got
zapped, but the portion between the gateway and system 39 was not.

Has anyone else reported similar problems?  Who should be notified?

Subject: (SYS:39)CRA015 is a TTYZNE crash. 

Login request (message type 6) received on port 172.
LDBLOG is 200000,,0 which means not logged in, zap in progress.
L2LOWT is set meaning SCNSER is waiting for orange ball to come back before
releasing the zapper.  L2LOWS is set meaning that L2LOWT has been on for 10
seconds (zapper will be unleashed if no orange ball within another 10 seconds).

This one might be SCNSER's fault.  I find it strange that the rest of LDBLOG is
all zero.  If the base thinks that particular port is not in use, it probably
will ignore the yellow ball instead of reflecting an orange ball.  Since the
base thinks the port is not in use, it is quite reasonable to send a login
request on that line.  The 68000 gets upset when we zap its login request.
I haven't checked to see what SCNSER does with the rest of the login request
(4 bytes of node id, 12 chars user name).  If it sends zaps for every one
of those bytes, I wouldn't blame the base for getting upset.  The 20 second
delay between yellow ball and zapper send by SCNSER is consistent with the
CTYLOG on CRA003.
  16:19:29 Something makes SCNSER think it should send a zapper on port 71.
           It sends a yellow ball first, starts the 20 second timer.
  16:19:32 Base wants to use port 71 for an aux circuit.  TTYZNE stopcode.
  16:19:49 Orange ball timer expires, SCNSER sends zapper.
  16:19:49 INFO stopcode BASE, Key=354.
  16:19:57 Stopcode IME (probably due to loop in TTYBMT output).

We should modify SCNSER to allow incoming logins to quietly cancel pending
zappers.  As long as the sign bit in LDBLOG is off, it make more sense to
take the base's word for it that the port is available to be re-used.  /Joe

Any FRMOP that accesses another job has to map the other job's context pages
into %UPX.  This access increments the use count stored in the other job's
dummy ATB (since context pages and private pages use the same ATB).
Therefore, the FRMOP that reads UPTLOG (as opposed to GETTABing LDBLOG) causes
the shared count of the target's job to be temporarily incremented.  If there
is a bug that doesn't decrement the count when the UUO finishes, then you
should be able to crash the system consistantly by simply doing that one
FRMOP to 2 or more different jobs until the field overflows.

Subject: Loop found in ISIS to 68K initialization. 

Paul Krumviede found a bug in ISIS where it sends the wrong command to the IPI
(68000 board) whenever slot 1 crashes.
1) Something goes wrong, ISIS crashes slot 1.  IPI sends KEY=354 to host.
2) Because CRASTOP is not set, ISIS does not stop on the crash, and instead
   tries to restart the slot.
3) Slot 1 executes SVC SYS,CONIP to connect to the IPI.
4) The kernel checks to see if the requesting slot was started as a result of
   a startup command or a crash restart condition.
5) Seeing that it is not an 'E' command from DDT, the kernel tells the IPI
   to reload itself.
6) The IPI sees the message to reload, doesn't recognize it, sends 354 to the
   PDP-10 and sends "I give up" to the Kernel, which crashes slot 1 again.
7) Go back to step 2, repeat every 4 seconds.

The original problem that caused step 1 is still unknown.  Any data about it
has been wiped out.  Dave Smith agrees this is a bug in the ISIS kernel.
Paul is trying a hack to the IPI code so it responds to message to reload
itself.

Always clear OPER mail before running ASP.  The noname stopcode in SCHED1
is an indication that OPER had an unread MAIL message or LETTER.  This
problem does not usually show up because OPER's mail is usually cleared
before before running ASP.  (Running a FULL DSKCLN before ASP has a side-
effect of clearing mail when OPER logs in to run TAKEIT.) 

If the system crashes while trying to login to a READONLY system, bring
the system up MANUAL, login as OPER, then run TAKEIT and HANG the system.
At this point you will be able to come up READONLY.		/Joe

Subject: B39-P035/D-6 in NEWMON. 

Patch #6 (TTYZAP.PAT) has been tested on X32 and applied to (M33:39)39N35D.
It is in NEWMON as B39-P035/D-6 and is ready to be loaded.
Patch #6 tests if TTYZAP has been asked to send a zapper to a not-logged-in 
port.  If so, it outputs INFO stopcode TTYZP1 with the job # and program
name, then goes ahead and sends the zapper without a yellow ball.  This way
we can determine if a program running on B39 is causing the problem.

To refresh your memory: B39-P035/D-6 and X32-P035/D-6 both include the SCNSER
log of IRING/ORING traffic and treat TTYZNE as a DEBUG stopcode (which goes
to BOOTS on B39).

Paul will build new node code for BB2674 that will halt the Engine when the
slot crashes so that a dump of the Dispatcher rings can be made on hardcopy.
Operations should force 39 to take a dump when the Engine halts so that
SCNSER's rings and slot 1's rings can be compared.

One obvious test we all overlooked - running the two pack DSKB on the

not using F30's or B39's monitor.  My guess is that some interrupt is

They are still using B39-P035/D-4 and my patch is in B39-P035/D-6.
That is, they are not running with the patched monitor yet.

Once they load from NEWMON, the patch will show up as "TTYZP1".  This will
be visible on hardcopy and via the CTYLOG.  If you have RC license, you can
run (MPL)CTYLOG to see the log.  The output is updated in real time if any
new messages arrive on the console, and the program continues until you
hit return.  Ignore the first 6 TTYZP1 typeouts caused by INITIA running
as part of the auto-restart procedure.  Any other TTYZP1 should point to
the culprit.

Subject: B39 crash 

  It looks as if the monitor tried to force a zapper on all ports when it
crashed the slot.  It seems that the monitor thinks that there is one more
port on the slot than does the dispatcher, so the zapper on port 7F caused
a slot crash.  In particular, I think that the monitor believes that there
are 127 ports, while the slot thinks that there are only 126 ports.  The
dispatcher doesn't check that the number of ports reported by the host in a
host status message is too large (it will never use more than the maximum
number defined in the slot control table anyway), so we never saw the dis-
crepancy).  I think that regenning slot 1 with one more port will fix this.

Subject: Annoyance: Zappers send when INITIA detaches. 

TTYZAP.PAT outputs INFO stopcode TTYZP1 whenever SCNSER tries to send a
zapper to a port that is not logged in.  The idea is to catch programs
doing that.  Well, the patch has already caught one program, but not the
right one.

Whenever a program issues the ATTACH uuo with an argument of -1, the frame
is detached from its line.  If it is already detached, not thing happens.
If there is an LDB, SCNSER sends a zapper to that port.  The lines that
run INITIA at startup are a bit strange.  These TTYs have LDBs but to not
have TYMNET ports.  At system startup, 6 TTYZP1 stopcodes are output when
INITIA detaches from TTY0 thru TTY5.

We may have to live with this unwanted typeout until the real guilty
program makes its presence known.  It is my feeling that some program
which runs on B39 only is causing SCNSER to send bad data to the base and
the Dispatcher crashes the slot when it gets the bad data.  The bad data
is probably a legitimate message that is not allowed under certain conditions
(such as while the port is in the middle of logging in).

   IT IS POSSIBLE TO REBUILD THE SYSTEM IF NECESSARY, PROBABLY,
   HOWEVER, WITH SO MANY DATA WRITE ERRORS DUE TO TAPE DRIVES,
   I WOULDN'T COUNT ON THIS BEING A GOOD DUMP.  REASON FOR
   SYSTEM ANSWERING LATE WAS DUE TO TAPES AND DRIVES.  THE
   SET OF TAPES USED WERE NEW (3/26) BUT EVEN WHEN I CYCLED IN NEW
   TAPES TO REPLACE THOSE, WE CONTINUED TO GET DATA WRITE ERRORS
   ON THE TAPEDRIVE.  WE ONLY HAD THE ONE TAPE DRIVE SO WERE FORCED
   TO USE IT, EVEN WITH DATA WRITE ERRORS

Subject: F30 problems & recovery 

Due to the apparent hardware problems with drive A1, it was not possible to
bring the system up for timesharing. The system was able to be brought up in
manual mode for disk inspection, however, none of the system files in (SYS)
were available.

I logged in "REFRESH MODE" and was able to run the disk reading programs and
disk repair programs (ASH and TSTSUP) from tape to determine the extent of the
damage to (SYS).  The retrieval block for [1,4].UFD contained garbage in
locations 131-777 which appeared to be UFD data.  Location 131 is the correct
word address for a UFD entry to start, so this confirms that somehow UFD data
was inadvertantly written into the RIB of the UFD instead of one of the UFD
data pages.  I cleared out the garbage data and fixed the pointers.

We also had read errors for the first BAT page and the third BOOT page.  I
copied the bad data for the BAT page to memory and corrected it.  After
rebooting the system, we ran ASP from tape to make an image copy of the bad
pack.  Then we restored the tape copy to a newly formatted pack.  All was
successful and the system came up with a FULL DSKCLN showing only 3 bad files.
Two of these were open when the system crashed and the third was caused by
a RIB error shortly before the first crash.

The message "BPB6 SECOND BAT BLOCK CONSISTANCY ERROR" was caused by the second
BAT page havinfg correct data which did not match the bad data from the first
BAT page.  This morning, I zeroed out the BAT page data to reflect running on
a newly formatted pack and this message should not occur anymore.

It is not completely certain that this was the only damage to the original
pack.  However, it was the only apparent damage to the file structure.  the
actions taken by the operations staff in taking the system down and calling
both hardware and software support was a significant aid in making the
successful recovery possible.
