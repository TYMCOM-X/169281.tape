The TYM file for node 4200 has some discrepencies which may have caused
NW4200.BND to fail.  It has ZITEL=0, NDP=128, and CONSAT=0 whereas all the
other EBUS bases have ZITEL=1, NDP=256, and CONSAT=1.  ZITEL=0 is valid
only for MAC I with core memory, not MAC II with semiconductor memory.

The new TYM file has been telecopied to (EBUS) and the new BND file has
been stored in (TYMNET:25) and (TYMNET:33)NW4200.BND.

Please try this file on the next scheduled reload of D34.    /Joe

BDA has been removed from (UAS).UFD.  That directory is missing files,
somewhere between 1 and 10 files, I think.  UAS needs to be restored with
"MODE OLD DISC".

System F34 hung twice with "Error in detached job, Paging Hardware Error".
Since Address-Break and AR/ARX errors are explicitly tested for, it must
 have been one of the following page fault codes:
XP PF.PRV,21		;PROPRIETARY VIOLATION
XP PF.RFE,22		;PAGE REFILL ERROR
XP PF.PTP,25		;PAGE TABLE PARITY ERROR
The actual code was not available as the system was down.
Told them to have the hardware checked.

System 34 got many RIBERR, BADUFD, BADSAT, and REDSAT errors
on many disks.  FSC replaced disk string controller, but DSKCLN
reported problems with the UFDs.  It was so bad that only SYS:
was accessable (via the pointer in the home page).  [1,1].UFD
was unreadable.  Since they could not even get to BOOTS, I had
them start a system rebuild.

Subject: "F34's disk problems were probably"... 

F34's disk problems were probably due to flaky memory hardware.
After discussing the symptoms of the DSKCLN failures with Carl Baltrunas,
we came to the conclusion that the problem with the RIB to SAT.SYS was
caused by memory.  As soon as the size of the monitor plus the size of
DSKCLN exceeded 256K (or maybe when the total exceeded 512K), things
started acting strange.  Attempts to read those pages produced 512 words
of 000000,,000000 or 777777,,777777 instead of valid data.

I recommend that Novadyne keep a sharp eye on F34's memory box.

A MAGNUM user was reporting "memory list consistency error" several times
today.  The program would work OK if run a second time.  We may be getting
double-bit errors, which don't show up as a parity error.

F34 crashed at 20:56 while I was getting rid of the "Bad data in RIB" at
index 67.  This time, DSKCLN did not report "CRITICAL FILE DAMAGED".
The problem that started Saturday has finally been fixed.

F34's base was down, and came back up at 00:06, but the PDP-10 and the base
were not in sync.  AUX circuits could not be built, and incoming TELECOPY
connections got stuck.  Attempts to reset the base caused a PAGZER stopcode.
F34 reloaded from (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV at 00:40 24-Aug-91.
