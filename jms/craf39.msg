B39 had some base type problems today, it seems slot one was
"restarting".  Somehow the memory buffers had been corrupted
and needed to be cleared.  When you see slot 0 running ok and can't
log in try pushing the "INI" button or the "bubble switch" on the
left corner of the CPU board.  This refreshes all memory and restarts the
node from ADDR 70 just the same as a reload.

Any questions just call me........Kal

Well Ops, it did it again today.  B39's base 2674 slot 1 went bad.  I
don't know what is causing this problem because there have been no changes
to the base code.  Have there been changes to the system monitor?
Since I was logged into the dispatcher of the base I was able to "HALT",
"INIT" and "EXECUTE" the 'bad guy' from here.  If this problem
continues I will look into it further.

Regards, Kal


Should be back off and come up on (SYS)BACKUP.SAV??????

Thanks Rick

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Rick Daniels, (415)498-2588, system B39
Problem:  LOGICAL UNIT 0 MISSING FROM DSKB and HOM PAGE CONSISTENCY ERRORs.
Diagnosis: Pages 2 thru 10 on DSKB0 got overwritten by ASCII text.
	It was a log file from someone generating node code from T12014.TYM.
	Page 1 had SIXBIT/*PEAK*/ in the first word, most likely it was
	(DGRAHAM)046PEA.001[11334,427741] (since fast DSKCLN complained that
	that file was not marked in the SATs).
Fix:	Pages 1 and 6 re-created using DSKB1:'s HOM pages as a template.
	Pages 2 and 7 reset to be empty BAT pages.  Pages 3,4,5 rewritten by
	running BOOTS, page 10 rebuild using F29's RIB to SAT.SYS as a guide.
	Running fast DSKLN in check mode reported only the 046PEA.001 file.
	B39 answered at 18:53.

Subject: "Explanation of INFO stopcode BASE."...

Explanation of INFO stopcode BASE.
This particular stopcode occurs when nonzero is deposited in location 30,
the value there matches IRP620 and ORP620 (or the saved copies of the IRING
and ORING pointers), and the KEY is other than 04.  If the key is 354 (octal),
it means that ISIS has told slot 1 (and the 68000) to crash.  After the
stopcode message is output, location 30 is zeroed and the PDP-10 continues.
If a second INFO stopcode BASE occurs, it means that ISIS has restarted the
slot, then halted it again.

At 8:39am 1-Apr-88, the INFO stopcode "BASE" was occurring approximately
every 4 seconds.  This means that either A) someone was running DDT in
slot 1 and restarting it every 4 seconds, or B) ISIS in ND2674 was screwed up.

At 8:41am, the INI button on the node was pressed.  This stopped the
continuous "BASE" stopcodes, produced "BASEOK" and "TIMEOK" events when
the Bubbnet supervisor resumed communication.  However, the excessive "BASE"
stopcodes had confused SCNSER to the point where 20 minutes later it
crashed at SCNSER+6145(TTPUTC+10) when all the bufferlets were full.

In general, whenever the INFO stopcode "BASE" comes out, the base is not to
be trusted.  It should be INIted or reloaded before continuing.

The most recent change to 39's base code was 4-Apr-88 by BBUNYAN.
(BUBBNET:39)BB2674.BND is loaded with version 5.22 of node code.
The previous BND file (dated 1-May-87) was loded with version 5.21 of
node code.  Did B39 have many base related problems in Jan, Feb, and Mar-88?

Subject: Suggestive steps for B39 .... 

To isolate and/or fix the problem B39 is having, these are
suggestive steps to take.

o  Most of the system crashes in last 2 weeks always started
   with TTYZNE event stopcode, follewed by some number of BASE
   event stopcodes and than crashed with some kind of STOP 
   stopcode.  To find out more information about the crashes, 
   made the TTYZNE a STOP stopcode and monitor should goto
   BOOTS when it detects it.  A crash dump should be taken to 
   be  analized.

o  B39's Base code should be tested running with the same
   base code as the rest of the systems, which is:
   Node code version 5.10
   ISIS code version 7.01
   to see if B39 will run as well as the other PDP10s.

o  Put diagnostic patch in monitor to save I/O ring messages 
   between the Base and the PDP10 to find out the message sequences 
   just prior to crash.

o  Run one of the Fremont D. C. hosts with the same base code
   version as B39:
   Node code version: 5.22
   ISIS code version: 7.03
   to see if it will experience the same problem as B39 is having.

Subject: "Patch has been tested on X32 and"... 

Patch #6 (TTYZAP.PAT) has been tested on X32 and applied to (M33:39)39N35D.
It is in NEWMON as B39-P035/D-6 and is ready to be loaded.
Patch #6 tests if TTYZAP has been asked to send a zapper to a not-logged-in 
port.  If so, it outputs INFO stopcode TTYZP1 with the job # and program
name, then goes ahead and sends the zapper without a yellow ball.  This way
we can determine if a program running on B39 is causing the problem.

To refresh your memory: B39-P035/D-6 and X32-P035/D-6 both include the SCNSER
log of IRING/ORING traffic and treat TTYZNE as a DEBUG stopcode (which goes
to BOOTS on B39).

Paul will build new node code for BB2674 that will halt the Engine when the
slot crashes so that a dump of the Dispatcher rings can be made on hardcopy.
Operations should force 39 to take a dump when the Engine halts so that
SCNSER's rings and slot 1's rings can be compared.

				/Joe

P.S.  Please bring the system up from (SYS)NEWMON.SAV, B39-P035/D-6
      next time the system comes up.  During the system startup you will
      see some INFO stopcode TTYZP1.  It is the side effect of patch #6,
      you can ignore them.

The great mystery has been solved!  Hurray!
The mystery was: Why does B39 crash with P035/A or later but no P034/P ?
                 Why does B39 crash but no other systems?
                 How can it be fixed?

The answer is: Delete (SYS)ZAP.SAV.

In July-86, the MOVE, DUPLIC and ZAP commands were added to the command table
to augment the COPY, RENAME, and DELETE commands.  This was added to P034/P31.
On all systems other than B39, typing the "Z" command produces the message
"?ZAP not found".  On system B39, it ran (SYS)ZAP.SAV, which has WC license.
That program sends zappers to all ports that are presumably not logged in.
(MPL)ZAP.INF says that the program should be run on both hosts connected to
the same Varian dual-base whenever the host was out of ports.  Because it
had WC, anyone could run it.  The TYM file for 39's base was set for 127
ports, numbered 0 through 126.  B39's monitor is set for 128 ports, numbered
0 through 127.  When ZAP.SAV sent a zapper to TTY177 (port 127), the ISIS
Dispatcher decided that was an illegal port number and crashed the EBUS slot.

Now that the problem has been located and fixed, I have disabled the TTYZP1
stopcode from B39-P035/D-6.			/Joe

Testing DSKB14:(BPA3) for errors.
I am running some programs to check if there are any more read errors on
BPA3.  I expect the count of HDEV errors to increment while the test is
running and some BADPAG messages to be printed on the CTY.  Don't be
suprised if the select light on BPA3 stays on continuously.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


To give system 39 more disk space, Fremont Data Center is planning
on converting it to a PAGE monitor the weekend of 6 - 7 August 1988.
Converting to a PAGE monitor from a BLOCK monitor picks up about 11%
of free pages on each unit.

While doing this conversion, system 39 will be unavailable for
approximately 48 hours.

Please discuss this with your Group/Users and let Fremont Data Center
know if this timeframe is acceptable.  It is is not, let the Center
know when it can be done.

Thanks

Subject: Hotline call for B39 

20-Jul-88 22:08/Joe
Incident: none, just message to call Mike Silva at Fremon Data Center
Problem:  B39 crashed with IME again, 6th time today.
          It passed diags, including 'B' string, but died even on the two-pack
          test system.
Status:   I was unable to login with the system up MANUAL because username
          JMS does not have shut-override on BUBBNET.  (Neither does OPER!)
          System would not stay up long enough to run fast DSKCLN using
          NOINITIA.  I had Mike bring B39 up in CONSOLE mode to copy all
          the crash dumps to tape so they could be restored to X32.
Analysis: All crash dumps are very consistent.  Page fault at USRCLK+4.
          The only way to get there is via:
		CIP5:	SKIPLE	J,JOB##
			 PUSHJ	P,USRCLK	;See if user wants a clock trap
          Location JOB is zero but PREVAC+J is 400.  That is, bit 27 is set
          in ac 2 of AC block 1.  Looks like a problem with SKIPLE or FM.

Subject: "The message user parity error"... 

The message '"Spurious" user parity error interrupt' means the system got a
parity error indication while running in user mode.  The monitor did a sweep
of all of core, but could not find the word with bad parity.  It then marked
all of the unfortunate user's core as bad ("ALL CORE REMOVED").  An unwanted
side effect of this is that each page of the user's core was reported as an
EVENT stopcode BADPAG.  The pages reported at 17:10:44 24-Jul-88 and on
06:58:25 25-Jul-88 are not really bad.  Their entries in the BAT pages have
been removed - run (MPL)TYPBAT to see the current list.     /Joe

The RIB error on [11334,15162].UFD and problems when doing "GFD BSCDEV"
were caused by a read failure when BPA4 got hung (DSKB5 is on BPA4).

Unit BPA4 Hung
%% EVENT stopcode RIBHRE at 22-Jul-1988 10:39:28
RIB error in DSKB:[11334,15162].UFD[1,1] on DSKB5: page 010164

The problem went away when I killed a detached job that had been trying to
GFD to BSCDEV.  This caused the monitor to re-read the RIB, which succeeded.

RE: [11334,264xx](FELDMAN).UFD[1,1]

THe file has been repaired so that normal TITO restore will work properly.

Please restore all incremental backups and the latest all-files for username
(FELDMAN) on system 39.  Use Mode Old Newest... One page of the UFD was lost
which account for about 100 files maximum.

Thanks.

Joe,
  got called about 22nd UFDER1 crash on B39... 2 DSKCLN runs today
found many files with rib pointers which it marked with POR and SLF.
I don't see any history of disk problems in CTYLOG, but I only did TAIL
to see the most recent day...

Let me know if you find out anything.  I'll look further later and
let you know if I find anything else out... looks like B39 is having
some kind of garbling problems......
