Thank you for your reply! I will send an ONTYME to NSC.EXCESS
and ask about the system in question!

No. I'm not planning to continue genning code. I, and my friends in
my computer association would like to have a PDP-10 just to program
on. PDP-10 is a great computer!

That F3 you mentioned... Is that a fullblown PDP-10? The only PDP-10s
I've seen is either MONSTROUS (older KI-systems) or in a smaller systems
like the 2020. I've never seen one in just a 19-inch rack!
Do you think that system will be thrown away? If it's a full-blown PDP
it sounds lika a nice and small system. (it would keep the cost's down
to ship it to Sweden! We don't have that much money in our association)

The F3 is a complete PDP-10 in that it executes all user-mode opcodes,
and does DATAI APR, CONO PI, DATAO TTY, like on the KA and KI. (We had to
teach EDDT that it was a KA/KI as far as talking to the console and
the front panel switches, but it was a KL/KS as far as the EPT was concerned.)

When placed next to a KS, the F3 racks are taller (6 feet instead of 5).
The CPU, memory, power supply, and front panel fit into one rack, the tape
drive, tape formatter, and disks fit into the other rack.  We had two
143 megabyte CDC disks on systems 930 and 62 - there was room for 3 disks.
Since the disks were no free-standing, an F3 system took less floorspace
than a KS system, and had approximately the same horsepower as a KS2020.
An F3 with a PDP-11 attached is capable of building aux circuits (for
TELECOPY, LOADII, etc).

We kept the sources to the TYMCOM-X monitor on system 930 and built the
monitors for all the Tymshare PDP-10s there.  If you're interested in
how the F3 was different (and have RF license), try looking at
(M33)F3SYM.MAC and (M33)COMMON.MAC on system 33.

The fate of the F3's will probably be decided in 90 days when the questions
hanging over the sale of FSCO are resolved.  I'll let you know if they
will be available.     /Joe

We, by just by an accident, years back, started to collect PDP-10 stuff, 
(we have 18 cpu's, ranging from KA to KL-e, but no PDP-6.)

This message comes from a 2*K10 (1077) running a 'hacked' version of Tops10
7.02, with DECnet phase-4 and TCP/IP etc... 

I have seen a F-4 @ symbiolics, before they throw it away, what is the size
of the F3?  If you dont't knew what to use it to, and it does not cost money
it will fit in our 300 sq meters computer room.

(we have the BBN-pager from Sails-KA, the old KL10 (1080) that where named
 MIT-MC and run ITS etc.....)

If you have direct Internet-access, you canb have an oucount on Kicki, to
execute POPJ's..

Ok... 
I'm not sure if Gunnar was out for their local club our the RIT,
(RIT=Royal Institute of Tecknology).

If i remember rigth, the F3 has 36 bits (9*4bit-slice) while the 
2020 has 40 bits. 

As we collect all sorts of stuff for the PDP10, all software that 
your company can give away might be of interest..

I have a KL-10 clone, made up of Xylinx programmable gatearrays 
at home. (Running the MRC version of Tops20).

TYMCOM-X has completely removed PRVTAB and instead stores 18 bits of license
in a privileged word in the RIB.  If you run a .SAV file that has the RF
license bit set, your job gets Read-Files license until the program exits.
There is also RA license to Read Absolute disk blocks (super-useti).
The reason I mentioned RF is because Gunnar has an account on F26.TYMNET.COM
and probably has RF and access to F33.

What ever happened to the project to get information on all the Operating
Systems that run on 36-bit machines?  I never got a chance to add details
about TYMCOM-X to that collection, and never saw the finished collection.

No. I wasn't asking for the RIT, but for "The National association of

Joe,
  F.Y.I.  just in case you need to do anything in the future, and i am not
available, the numbers printed by trace are the word offsets into the file,
however 0 = 1000, since the first page has info and the usage map.

To zero the pointer for PANGILINA, (I knew the format was:
   word 0 :  man,,sub
   word 1 :  gni,,sib
   word 2 :  grt,,gft
where man=manager, sub=subordinate, gni="gnilbis" or back-sibling,
sib=sibling, grt=grants, gft=gifts)

However, OROURKE's id-pointer was 33240,  so it was simple to locate the
pointers that said 1000+33260[ 33240,,33300  and replace it with 0,,33300
without knowing the above format.

See previous message as for future fixes to SETOP... not sure when it will
be done, since %n (105) is what is running, current sources are for 107
with previous soruces available, but additional fixes not yet tested were
installed and I need to evaluate whether they ought to be added or not.

I've changed the ROUTER.NET on 74 to send everything to tymix by default so
it is no longer necessary to keep an inclusive list of every workstation that

forward addresses that are known to be "on TUMS" to 74.  Its a much smaller
list and its guarenteed (by policy) to never grow any bigger.  -Bill

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Joe,

I have a user on System 34 who transmits data via a Teletype machine
into a fortran program.  They are getting rid of the Teletype (not a
moment too soon) and will be using a PC to transmit a file.

 I do not know Fortran and do not know how to alter the program so that it
 does not look for data coming from a Teletype.  Right now there
is a format card with a 'start reader' message. 

Is there someone in your group who would be able to assist me?

Best regards,

I could look at the FORTRAN program to see if it is feasable to change.
My guess is that the program is sending out a Control-R character.
That character causes an ASR-33 (a Teletype with automatic paper tape
reader) to start the paper tape reader which transmits data to the computer.

Let me know the name of the FORTRAN program and what directory it is in.

I patched the PDP-10 monitor to log failures as well as successes for the
CREAUX call.  Everything was quiet, from Friday night through early Monday.
At 7:00am PST, the failures started incrementing, when (MSNTRACK)DUBAK
started.  (MPL)SCREAM reported the following:

102 CREAUX failures in 135 attempts from 10:16:23 to 10:28:57.
195 CREAUX failures in 220 attempts from 11:23:12 to 11:31:35.
293 CREAUX failures in 321 attempts from 12:30:44 to 12:41:54.
369 CREAUX failures in 395 attempts from 13:36:25 to 13:49:18.

Included in the list are 18 failed attempts to XRAY:11331,
26 attempts to XRAY:11454, 13 to XRAY:11458, 23 to XRAY:11459, etc.

I'm giving a copy of this to Edsel Boudar.

The program (PSI:34)FAST1 is a self contained FORTRAN program.
It did not work for me when I tried it from my directory in that it
attempted to read the file TEST.DAT instead of reading from the terminal.

But other than that, it looks like any terminal emulator program could
be used.  All it needs is the ability to do a simple sent of an ASCII
file from the PC's disk.

I changed the entry in the LUD so that if DCSFRS receives a circuit zap
while running a program, the job will detach but the program continues
running.  The next person to log into DCSFRS will be attached to that
job, so nothing will be lost.

Status of BND files for the PDP-10 bases:

Currently, BITS on the Suns is not capable of loading slot 2 with S-records
for the M68000 on the IPI board on the EBUS bases.  This means that the
PDP-10 bases have to be reloaded from another PDP-10.

All the BND files for the EBUS nodes have been copied to directory TYMNET
on all the PDP-10 systems.  This means we don't have to rely on system 33
for reloading the bases.

RE:	Project "OSIRIS"


OSIRIS is the name of the  project team responsible for migrating internal users
from the OnTyme systems to the Dialcom systems.  It has been proposed that in
order to supervise an orderly migration from one system to another, that ID's be
assigned in a batch mode. To deliver to the Dialcom Operations Staff a "clean"
list of OnTyme users will greatly improve the success of the program downstream.
Is it possible for the OnTyme Supervisors to update and verify all of the OnTyme
users on their respective lists by March 23?  (It has been suggested that many
of the current ID's are inactive due to recent staff reductions.) 
	
Thank you very much for your consideration of this request.

26-Apr-90 02:55 /Joe  (2.5 hours)
Contact: Alicia Williams (EDINET, RAILTRACK) (800)228-3164
Symptom: Railtrack reports are late because MAGNUM jobs are disappearing
	out from under PCOM.  Alicia says that failure to produce these
	reports may cost the company a million dollars.
Cause:	The stream accounting shows that just before the MAGNUM job
	terminated, someone else logged into DCSOPEN and killed it.
	Further investigation shows that BUELNAJ had logged in from F38,
	set AC license, created an aux circuit as DCSOPEN:74, and typed
	"LOGOUT 18".  Why is this person from MIS killing Railtrack jobs?
Fix:	The INIT program from (BUELNAJ:74) has been set to (SYS)LOGOUT
	and a HOLD put on OPER password BUELNA.  Voicemail has been sent
	to Dick Kovach, Jim Buelna's manager.

In regard to the OPER password file - when you TELECOed it from System

file does not have WC assigned to it?  If I knew this,
I would have done it.

There are only 2 ways to "set status" when DRWSPR.EPO is messed up.
1) Have a SETE password in the monitor to use, or
2) Bring up the system in CONSOLE mode and type SET LICENSE.
The only people who have SETE passwords currently are CARL, OSMAN, WRS, JMS.

Is the "SET LICENSE" command documented in the mini manuals?  It does
require that the system be rebooted in CONSOLE mode, but does not require
any password and does not depend on any file having license.

Thanks for pointing that out.  F37 was missing (SRA)SYSDAT.SAV and did not
have an entry in the SUBMIT queue.  For both F37 and F56, I logged in as
SRA, and inserted an entry by doing the following:
	SUBMIT
	DATE STARTUP
	INSERT SYSDAT.SAV
	(no log file)
	RESTART START
	TIME 0
	PRIORITY 10

The files (SRA)CTYLOG.mmm are a side effect of obsolete code.  The files you
want to look at are (SYS)*.MSG and (SYS)*.CTY, which are created by (SYS)SYSLOG
which is invoked by (SYS)CRON.SAV via (SYS)CRON.CTL.

Thinking about going back to school in the fall?  BT Tymnet has enhanced the
tuition reimbursement policy to include reimbursement for courses that are part
of a degree program that is directly related to:

*   your current position OR
*   to another position within the company.

The process for reimbursement is the same - first receive your manager's
approval, then take the course and receive a grade "C" or better, and last,
submit your bills to Human Resources for reimbursement.

The revised policy will be issued to managers this month with other Human
Resource policy revisions.

PRODUCT MANAGER ONTYME NAME:  

CLIENT NAME (TYMNET if no other):  Public-Net Code Generation Systems, Fremont

PIR DESCRIPTION:  
I have been told that I have to submit a PIR in order to get a bug fixed.
The bug occurs in lines 1389 and 1392 of the file XCOM04.I03 where it
defines the default for the HIHOST macro.  This number appears to be
arbitrarily set at 12000, with no good reason for using that particular
number.  Since the public net is currently assigning X.25 host numbers
above 12000, the definition for HHOSTN should be 13000 or 19999.  As it
stands today, the defaults for the XCOM slot do not allow me to place
a call from host 3106012027 to 3106012028.  Invoking the HIHOST macro in
the TYM file is not a valid solution, since the problem is network wide.

PIR PURPOSE:  
The purpose is obvious.  TYMNET sells the ability to connect any X.25 host
in DNIC 3106 to any other host in that DNIC, but the current XCOM code
does not work as advertised for hosts above 12000.

REVENUE OR COST IMPACT:  
Zero cost (less than 1/2 man-hour to verify and install edit into the sources).
Impact: New X.25 customers will be prevented from using TYMNET to place
calls to high-numbered hosts until each CS stumbles across this bug and
has to discover the patch themselves.  This lack of a suitable default
will cause headaches later.

PIR IMPACT:  
No impact to other software.  The actual value of HHOSTN should match the
highest host number allowed in the Public Net SUP code.

MARKETING COMMENTS:  
Implementing this bug fix has no marketing impact.  Not implementing this
fix gives the customers the impression that TYMNET does not know what it
is doing.  (I.E. the XCOM code does not know how big the Public Net is.)

ADDENDA (Optional):  
As of 4:30pm PST on Tuesday 10-Jul-90, this problem is open as ticket 303079.

Is there anyway to find out what the request numbers are, and if so,
can I delete (VOID/CANCEL) THEM.

Sorry, I do not know the answers to your SPFIX question.
I have forwarded a copy to Carl, but there is a strong possibility

GOOD NEWS!!!    THE COMPUTER LOAN PROGRAM IS OPEN!!!

The Computer Loan Program provides interest free computer loans to full-time
employees on the active payroll for 80% of the total purchase price (not to
exceed $4,000.00).

1.  The equipment must be new and must be purchased from a business which is
authorized by the PC manufacturer to sell their products.  Mail order buying is
excluded.

2.  The equipment purchased must meet the company hardware standards as
developed by the BT Tymnet MIS Production Systems Department.

3.  The loan will be repaid through weekly payroll deductions, not to exceed two
years.

4.  Employees may not have more than one computer loan outstanding at any given
time.

5.  Employees obtaining a loan will receive one check made payable to the vendor
from whom the purchase is being made.

6.  Caution:  The entire unpaid loan balance remaining at the time of an
employee's termination (for any reason) becomes due and payable immediately.

Contact the San Jose Human Resources office (408/922-6280) to obtain the
appropriate forms and/or additional information.

Subject: The SATs on F26 are very sick. 

System 26, like System 33, has the maximum number of disks that DSKCLN can
handle.  With 25 units on line, DSKCLN has very little free memory left
for keeping track of directory entries that need to be fixed up.

anywhere from 200 to 2000 files have been damaged.  (Including files in
SWBNET, ANZNET, DECNET, etc.)  DSKCLN version 111 died with the error
message "INSUFFICIENT CORE" when the fix-up chain got too long.
I have created version 112, which will do as much as it can, write the
updated SATs to disk, and then re-run DSKCLN from scratch to catch the
rest of the file problems.

Subject: DSKCLN problems on F26 

System 26, like System 33, has the maximum number of disks that DSKCLN can
handle.  With 25 units on line, DSKCLN has very little free memory left
for keeping track of directory entries that need to be fixed up.

One of the SATs on DSKB5: has been completely wiped out.  This means that
anywhere from 200 to 2000 files have been damaged.  (Including files in
SWBNET, ANZNET, DECNET, etc.)  DSKCLN version 111 died with the error
message "INSUFFICIENT CORE" when the fix-up chain got too long.
I have created version 112, which will do as much as it can, write the
updated SATs to disk, and then re-run DSKCLN from scratch to catch the
rest of the file problems.  (Actually, this last step required a reboot
since the monitor does not allow DSKCLN to run twice in a row.)

At 2pm, Thursday, the new version of DSKCLN was ready.  The following
cycle of events were repeated every 3 hours:
	1) A full DSKCLN is started.
	2) It detects 'FMUP' = a File with a Multiply Used Page.
	3) DSKCLN runs out of memory for keeping track of damaged files.
	4) Pass 2 is started to locate the other files that share this
	   FMUP problem.
	5) DSKCLN cleans up as many files as it can, by punching holes.
	6) DSKCLN writes good SATs to the disk, and attempts to restart.
	7) Monitor gets stopcode SWPNDP, the operator forces another FULL.

Each time through the cycle, more files would be found and fixed, so
progress was being made, albeit very slowly.

At 6am Friday, I was called to verify that these multiple DSKCLNs were
still working.  At that time I found one more change that could be made
to DSKCLN to make it fix even more files.  The last full DSKCLN ran from
7am to 11am.  At that point I had operations bring up system 26 with a
fast DSKCLN so that they could get started restoring the damaged files
and allow users to log in.

The disk is still not completely fixed; F26 will get BADSAT warnings as
an indication that there are still some damaged files out there.  The
operators should force another full DSKCLN sometime this weekend to get
the last of the damage cleaned up.

On any system other than F26 or F33, all this mess would have been taken
care of by a single run of DSKCLN.  But since these two systems have 25
logical units, DSKCLN is stuck trying to work with limited memory.

The only long term solution is to reduce the number of files on F26 and F33
to the point that the system can be rebuilt using only 24 logical disks.

Until further notice, use the following procedure when running DSKCLN on F26:
If the system runs a full DSKCLN and then crashes with SWPNDP, run a 2nd 
full DSKCLN.  If this 2nd DSKCLN crashes, force a fast DSKCLN and bring
up the system for users.  DSKCLN takes about 3 hours when it has to run pass 2.

I will be on vacation until 5-Sep; call on Carl or Craig for support.

Rick,
  I have talked to Ed about Jan's request... She had left me voice mail which
I picked up a few days later, and once tried to call Jan... but since I never
heard back again about it I had assumed it was resloved.  Ed & I talked last
week about checking it and I've been out of the office.  I haven't seen any
thing that should be hogging CPU time.  I want to investigate further and check
some of the SYSDAT data to see if it shows a pattern.

  It is possible that there are just more users since we are shutting down the
PDP-10s.  Need to get Jan to see if there were any user moves around the time
that the performance degredation started to occur.

One thing that will cause the system to be very slow is when it runs of
out of disk space.  When the number of pages free gets low (such as below
10,000) the system has to run around all over the place trying to get
to the free pages.  F30 got down to 800 pages yesterday.

You could duplicate an ASP tape with PIP, but that would fail unless you
could guarentee that each and every output tape was at least 2 feet
longer than its corresponding input tape.  It would take a new program
(about as big as ASP.SAV) to handle EOT intelligently.

Subject: Maintenence of the DEC 2020 systems in Nicholsen Lane. 

This is in reference to a Memorandum of Understanding, dated 14 November
1989.  It was signed by Harry Matthews on 11-17-89 and by W.  H.
Kersten on 11-16-89.

It is my understanding that this agreement is still in effect.  Until
Novadyne gives formal notification to BT Tymnet Network Operations,
we consider this support contract to be valid.

We need to get the issue of hardware support cleared up quickly.  The
status of the DEC 2020 test bed system has deteriorated to the point
where they are not reliable.  This has serious potential consequences,
since the 2020 systems are required to backup the PDP-10 systems at the
Fremont Data Center.

The nodes which are the bases for the PDP-10 systems can only be loaded
from another PDP-10.  Previously, when Fremont had a power failure
outlasting the UPS, the PDP-10 bases were reloaded from systems 25 or 54
in Dallas.  But when the last PDP-10 system was shut down in Dallas, the
Fremont Data Center became dependent on the DEC 2020 system for this
function.

Considering the amount of business still being done on the PDP-10 systems,
the ability to recover quickly after a power failure is critical.  For
this reason, the DEC 2020 systems must be maintained under a formal
contract.

I will be the primary contact for the DEC 2020 systems, and I expect the
following equipment to be restored to full functionality:

When is convenient for you to get together on this?  I can come
over there.  These procedures will have to be changed anyway when
System 33 goes away.  Don't know how we will perform this after

                             PRELIMINARY

Rick,
This message is being sent to you only (rather than all concerned),
since it is not yet complete.  What needs to be addressed, is having
the DDT session captured to a file (recorded).  I believe the ability
to capture the DDT data lies with one of the following options;
(1) Operations staff having access to a pc with capture program installed.
(2) Using either the (spl)auxio or (spl)record program on the pdp-10s.
(3) Having another department perform the recording of the DDT session.

Notes:
Option (1) - PCs are not available to Operations staff at this time.
Option (2) - Please contact Joe Smith to work out details.  Afterwards,
             I will re-write and re-send this message and with those
             details included.  We need to consider that relying on
             pdp-10 programs may not be ideal since they will become
             obsolete with the pdp-10's demise.  Further, since the
             (spl)auxio or (spl)record programs on the pdp-10s may NOT
             be transported to the unix environment, the procedures
             will have to be re-written.
Option (3) - If the procedures were to be taken over by another group,
             Netcon would be the most likely candidate group.  However,
             I tend to think that Fremont Operations should be performing
             them anyway.

F.Y.I. - I am having problems with the AUXIO part of the following
         procedures.  Everything else is correct.

Thank you, Sheldon Cohen

Rick Daniels;

The following steps should be taken whenever the Netval Public Network
slot crashes (prior to reloading the slot).  By reviewing the results
of steps 1 and 2, the STS group will be better equiped to evaluate the
reason for the crash.

The following steps should be taken on future Netval Slot Crashes;

STEP 1 - Get DDT info.
           (page 51 - NETVAL OPERATIONS GUIDE)
           See "Procedures for getting DDT info from crashed slot"
           (Please note recommended changes to this section, below)

STEP 2 - Dump the slot.
           (page 53 - NETVAL OPERATIONS GUIDE)
           See "Procedures for dumping crashed slot"

STEP 3 - Perform reload.
           (page 45 - NETVAL OPERATIONS GUIDE)
           See "Recovering from the crashed slot"

Joe;

If all TYMCOM-10 monitors are going to be regin for security reasons, let
me inform you of my plan in case ofa major disaster here at the center.

From what I can find out the only hardware that was shipped to Valley Forge
as backup was:

    2 - KL10's 
    2 - ARM10LS's
    2 - Upgraded SA-10's

All cables for this hardware was also sent.  Oh, yes, 2 TYMNET engines 
with c-buckets. 

No Upgraded 3674's, disk drives, tape drives or controller, and no 
decwriters for CTTY or OPER.

I'm hoping to convince Bill Fischer to ship four (4) strings of 3650's
to Valley Forge after we convert all out systems here to 3652's.

So, what I am going to need is monitor for each system that will allow
them to be brought up on either type of disk drives.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Thanks Rick

Joe/Carl;

I need to talk to either one of you about LODSAV under (APSSUP:33/37).

Operators use this software to save and load ONTYME production and
save SLOT crashes to disk


I've tried running this with 'AC' status set, but I get bombed out.
Without 'AC" status th software tells me that it is not set.

The file on system 37 says it was created on 25 april 91 and the
file on 33 says it was created on 13 dec 88.

If this program would runwithout   (forget this line).

Need to have this program run without Operators having to be granted
'AC' license.  On System 37, I got 'timeout' when trying to run it.

Any help you can give is appreciated.

Subject: Another way of getting messages from PDP-10 to ONTYME. 

If you want, there is a way to set things up so you can read and send
ONTYMEs without hassling with the ONTYME editor.  All it requires is
a message to JMS@F74 that gives the following information:
	1) Your PDP-10 user name(s) that will be sending to ONTYME.
	2) Optional: Name where to send all incoming ONTYMEs.
	3) Your ONTYME ID and KEY (password).
The ONTYME poller will log in on your behalf 4 times a day, pull all
new messages, and forward them to a PDP-10 or Unix account.  That's
why it needs your ONTYME password to operate.

To send a message to an ONTYME account, use something like:
	.TUMS FSC.JM/SMITH@ONTYME
	Subject: ...
	Enter message, end with Control-D
	~rFILE.NAME				To read in a file
	~p					To print current message

Subject: Host Swaps


Joe;

Something just dawn on me.  When we swap a host between nodes, are
the bases reloaded with the code that the host was originally running
on?

In my mail to you about the monitors, I said 38 was on node 7021 and
that 34 was on node 6415.  It is the opposite.  38 is running on node
6415 and 34 is running on node 7021.

Should the base that 38 is running on (6415) be reloaded so that it
is running on Node 7021 and 34 be reloaded so that it is running on
6415 instead of 7021?

Joe;

System 37 is going away at the end of the month.  When it does, what
I am planning on doing is:

     a.  Move 38 onto this hardware.  It has been running better than
the hardware it is now running on.  Back in January of this year we
swapped System 34 from hardware JJJ, Node 7021, CPU 1081 with system
38 from hardware AAA, Node 6415, CPU 1405.  Since System 34 has been
running on hardware AAA, CPU 1405, it has been performing almost 100%
and this makes RAILTRACK happy.

     b.  System 34 will stay where it is at.

What I need from you is:

     a.  Change 34's monitor to reflect that it is running on hardware
AAA, CPU 1405, Node 6415.

     b.  If you want, you can change 38's monitor to reflect that it is
on hardware JJJ, CPU 1081, Node 7021, or wait until it has been moved to
hardware FFF, CPU 1324, Node 6720.

Let me know what you decide to do.

Thanks Rick

It appears that ONTMTP had a bug that when a login failed, it would
skip all the adjacent users with the same home Ontyme system.  This has
been fixed.

The new ONTYME/ONTMTP daemons also will upon seeing the message that a
password has expired, change it to TEMP*KEY and then change it back.
This should provide uninterrupted service in the future.  I hope nobody
expects their Ontymes to be secure.

Subject: PDP10 monitors as of 18-Jul. 

On the 18th of July I created 3 monitors with the following configuration:

XP SYSNO,'F34'
XP APRSN,<'KL',,^D1405>	;CPU type and serial number
XP APRNAM,<'AAA',,7021>	;Hardware and base number

XP SYSNO,'F38'
XP APRSN,<'KL',,^D1324>	;CPU type and serial number
XP APRNAM,<'FFF',,6720>	;Hardware and base number

XP SYSNO,'F37'
XP APRSN,<'KL',,^D1081>	;CPU type and serial number
XP APRNAM,<'JJJ',,6415>	;Hardware and base number

This was before I knew that 38's base was going to be moved to a
different KL.  I may have gotten some of the bases confused.  If this
configuration is useable, the monitors are in (M33) on each of the
systems.  If not, send me another mail message stating the desired
configuration.

Joe;

Regarding PDP10 monitors

The information for f34 is correct.

Please change so that F38  base number is 6415.  This node has been upgraded
so it will be physically moved to hardware FFF when 38's software is moved.

Please change so that F37 base number is 6720.  This node will be physically
moved to hardware JJJ.

Everyone's ONTYME password expired 1-Jul-91.  That was a decision made
by the people that run ONTYME.  You'll have to talk to NSCMS.SUP to get
a new password set up for NSCMS.BE/STARKS.  The ONTYME-to-Unix will not
be able to forward your messages until it gets your new password.

The change occurred suddenly on 3-Jul, when everyone's password expired.
The first I heard of it was when the ONTYME poller suddenly started failing.

Subject: Username BOXCMAIL has overflowed the LUD. 

The simplest thing is to give up on the name BOXCMAIL and assign a new
one, such as BOXC2MAIL.  Running (CUD10)USERS indicates that the LUD and
the DUL both have problems.  You could have operations restore them both
from the backup tapes.

  There is a 25000 page .mai file of undelivered and other mail that has
caused this problem.  How this file GOT to be 25000 pages is a mystery,
but it may have been someone sending a huge mail file to a lot of people
via dialcom or ontyme.

  The mail is still un-sent, but the file has been moved OUT of the mail
directory until we can split this file into smaller messages and get it
sent out.

  Sorry this too so long...  -Carl

What programs are you running, and what do you mean by "when the commands file
is executed"... in terms of it does NOT run.   What doesn't run?

What commands file are you using?

Have you checked that these programs and the files match the ones on
the OTHER pdp-10s?

Please look into this and get back to us afterwards.

It's supposed to be running FNDBAD, not SZRPT.

When I said "rerun fndbad *", it said "abort-license".  So I cancelled the
entry, re-inserted it, and did another return.  Got another "abort-license".
Figuring that it might have had the bad copy of DRWSPR.EPO open from before,
I killed XEXEC and EXECX, re-inserted FNDBAD, did a rerun on it, then
started up XEXEC.  I did not think to clear out the active area first,
and it ran SZRPT instead of FNDBAD, and the active area is messed up again.

Dear OnTyme Account Supervisor,
 
Please help us update our records by sending me an OnTyme, indicating
your name, your telephone number, your department and location,
and a brief description of what your department uses OnTyme for.  
We periodically like to make sure that we know who each of the OnTyme 
account supervisor's are, and make sure that you know where to turn 
for help.
 
As an account supervisor, you are in charge of administering your
department's use of OnTyme.  This entails adding and removing usernames,
changing user passwords if they forget theirs, and assisting end
users with problems.  As the account supervisor, you are entitled
to call our support group (800-435-8880) for assistance.
 
You may, of course, request assistance by OnTyme at ACS.HOTLINE.
 
Each month we prepare a session summary report for each account.  
This report shows the total activity for your account, broken
down by mailbox.  If this report has not been reaching you, or
if you would like to receive this report via OnTyme or tape
(either instead of or in addition to hardcopy), please let me know.
 
If at any time you have a problem, or are unable to achieve satisfaction
through either of the aforementioned channels, please contact me
personally at 408-922-6376 or ACS.N/SMITH.
 
I would be happy to hear from you and help you resolve the problem.
 
Thank you for using OnTyme.
 
Sincerely,
 
Norman Smith

Subject: TAPELIB problem 


After Joe checked the sources, it is apparent that the problem affects any
opername that has SU license.  The reason is that the SU license bit is
the sign bit and thus the license returned is negative.  The routine also
returns a negative number whenever the opername and passwords do not match.
SO, it is impossible to tell the difference.

Suggested fix:
  All users that need to use TAPELIB that have an oper name with SU license
should have a second oper name that has the same license minus SU.  Since
the number of people with SU should be very very small, adding a few names
is the "best" solution in my opinion.

  The sources COULD be updated, but I prefer NOT doing this, since it
would require a re-release of the software and might take extra time
to make sure nothing else is broken.

The program (CUD10)USERS can be run by anyone with enough license.
It is the first place I look when checking problems that may be LUD
related.  I'm afraid that the only solution is to have the people in
Resources purge as many users as they can from the LUD so that we
won't run into overflow blocks.

Subject: JOBS=117 on F26 and F33. 

All PDP-10's have 128 network ports, and from 34 to 39 PTY pairs.  That's
why (CARL)LOGON reports 196, 200, or 206 ports available.

The number of jobs is defined in (M33:33)CONF##.MAC, and is set to 128
with 3 exceptions.

JOBS=117 on F26 and F33 because they have 4 logical strings of disks.
(With 32 disks and 128 jobs, the monitor won't fit in 256K.)
JOBS=110 on F23 in an attempt to leave more room for FRECOR.

Note that the useable number of jobs is 1 less that what is defined due
to table space being reserved for job 0.
		-Joe

Subject: access problem 

Linda,
  the A19 error that J.Lindback is having is exactly what I thought it was,
and what we discussed on the phone.  Has Dick checked these specific nodes?
(And made sure that system 26 was up-to-date with the nodes in question?)

 FATAL ERROR A19.033				<-- But it's still the same
 PLEASE CONTACT YOUR TYMSHARE REPRESENTATIVE IMMEDIATELY.

...says, accounting error 19, for job/frame 33
  A19 is royalty accounting not being able to find the node number in order
  to assess country-of-origin for possible surcharges.

Welcome to BT - TYMNET, Node 11375
-1375:01-007-					<-- This is my Consat node

14146 ANSWERED 0 12676 0 IIX-N MUX SLOT# 3	<-- and its on node 12676

I would have Dick check node 12676 and node 2676 before going any further.
At this point... we should put all nodes into the royalty accounting data
files... for some reason, this keeps coming up from time to time.

Also check node 11375 and 1375... you never know how it handles the high-
order numbers...

Looks like all they are doing is running TITO to do an incremental save
and an occasional DIRIT to get directory listings.
Hardly any editing, I saw no use of NAD or LOADII this time.

The files SYSTEM.SAV and NEWMON.SAV have been updated on all PDP-10s
(including 56 and 32).  Two patches were added, one to automatically
save the crash dump on an AR.ARX stopcode, and the second to fix
a security problem.

New monitor tapes should be cut for each system.
