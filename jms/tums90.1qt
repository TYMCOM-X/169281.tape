------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The netload directory on systems 25 and 54 contains alot of out of date files. 
It is said that netload is "an unmanaged directory" and has been for more than 
a year. The complications because of this are far too complicated to sort out, 
therefore, netload from 25 and 54 will not be moved to Unix. It will be 
written to tape, shipped to Fremont and archieved. 
 
If you have any files in netload on these systems that you want moved to Unix 
PRODUCTION directories then you need to submit a PDP 10 backup request to PI 
by close of business Pacific time on Monday 8 January. The last time PI will 
act on backup requests for 25 and 54 is Tuesday the 9th in the morning. If you 
miss this deadline for whatever reason then netcopy the files to Unix 
yourself, regen and submit Unix update requests NO SOONER THAN 13 January. We 
don't want to get these mixed up with the code coming out of TYM and TYM5 on 
the 10th and 11th.

Hi, Joe.  David says that he's been sending the batches to system 38, not
system 74.  He sent one yesterday, Jan 7, 1990, at approximately 20:37:57.
If this isn't enough, call me and I'll have David send another one.

Because of the BT TYMNET reorganization, scheduling changes, and a
temporary lack of instructor resources, we must cancel the TTT.210 and
TTT.220 IBM classes. We will soon publish a second (April - June) and
third (July - September) quarter schedule of classes, at which time we plan
to offer these classes.
 
We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

ATTENDEES:  L. Chavez, M. Erickson, H. Matthews, J. Smith, 
            P. Whitehurst 

        I.  NEXT MEETING - 2:00 P.M. Thursday 1 February C5-645.

       II.  IMPORTANT NEWS:  (1) Field CS and anyone else who owns
                                 Public Net code should review gen
                                 errors contained in /tym/n/genlog and
                                 /tym/n/errorlog to rectify any gen
                                 failures and get functional code into
                                 UNIX production directories.

                             (2) Attempts are being made to obtain 
                                 releases of NAD and BITS which fix
                                 several known bugs (debugging and
                                 loading related) on 1/26.

                             (3) CKnode will be maintained, this is the
                                 definitive information source where
                                 production code resides.
    
                             (4) There are four PDP code gen systems;
                                 F33, F26, D31 and D37.  The next goal
                                 of the project will be to condense
                                 the four systems into 3 and close 
                                 down one of the Dallas (D) systems by
                                 1 March.

                             (5) See Section 4.4 for specific 
                                 information.



      III.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            3.1  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD has released to QA a BITS version
                                 with equivalence file support and fixes
                                 to all reported BITS bugs.  After
                                 satisfactory QA, it will be released to
                                 the Public Net.

                   Update: 1/11  See Important News, point (2).   

            3.2  Failed Loads 

                 A.  BITS 2.11 was installed to fix 2 problems.  Whether
                     or not 2.11 actually fixed both of them is unclear
                     since several other user problems came up. Therefore,
                     BITS 2.10 dated 25 September was re-installed.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD has re-released to QA a BITS version
                                 with equivalence file support and fixes
                                 to all reported BITS bugs.  After
                                 satisfactory QA, it will be released to
                                 the Public Net.

                   Update: 1/11  See Important News, point (2).

                 B.  Netcon has reported some load failures.  P. Michel,
                     on advice from STS, recommended a troubleshooting 
                     plan to Netcon to gather more information on load
                     failures.

                   Action: 12/21 Netcon to implement plan when failures
                                 occur.

                   Update:  1/18 One type of load failure is found to be
                                 caused by unused sync parts left with
                                 wired clocks.  Another is still under
                                 investigation.

            3.3  NAD BUG

                 1) NAD bug observed during unattended batch job
                    when a circuit was built but never completed

                   Update: 12/28 NTD to advise date when fix will be 
                                 delivered at the next meeting.

                   Update:  1/11 No release date given.

            3.4  INTERACTIVE NAD 

                   Update: 11/30 The reason this script fails to operate 
                                 is UNIX NAD does not support switching 
                                 between command and interactive nodes.
                                 This is an explanation why some debugging
                                 scripts used on the PDP don't work, or 
                                 need modification, under UNIX.



                   Update: 12/21 NTD, recognizing the importance of
                                 switching NAD between command and 
                                 interactive modes will implement this 
                                 feature in a new NAD release. 

                   Update:  1/11 Fixed, see Important News, point (2).

        V.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update:  10/5 H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source, and access controls.

                   Update:  1/4  B. Soley is preparing a paper that 
                                 advises all measures for SUN System    
                                 operators to implement in order to secure
                                 BT Tymnet UNIX systems.

                   Update:  1/25 B. Soley advises significant delays to 
                                 produce this report.  I will make 
                                 attempts to get an interim release.

       VI.  SOFTWARE ORDERING AND FULFILLMENT PROCEDURES

                   Update: 11/30 A sub project is underway to modify 
                                 Tymnet information process so that all
                                 software shipments from the UNIX systems
                                 is initiated via the OES.

                   Update:  1/4  This project is near completion.  See
                                 J. Weisinger for details.  Full effect on
                                 private and subnets will be evident when
                                 all code gen PDP's are shut down.

                   Update:  1/11 Subnets and Private Networks must place
                                 orders to migrate from PDP to SUN.

      VII.  BITS 4.0 AND 5.0

                   Update:  11/2 Scheduled delivery date 6 February '90.

                   Update:  12/7 New delivery date is now 2 March 1990.  
                                 Further schedule slips are not allowed
                                 without UNIX migration team approval.

                   Update:  1/11 NTD removed a delivery from BITS 4 to 
                                 BITS 5.  BITS 4 delivery remains 1 march.

       II.  IMPORTANT NEWS:  (1) See OnTyme message No. M11058
                                 for missing NIB files.

                             (2) New BITS and NAD is released to 
                                 Public Net, even though QA rejected
                                 the code eta test status.
                                 Present release of BITS and NAD are
                                 reported to have satisfactory fixes
                                 for known bugs.  The bugs these 
                                 programs have which caused QA rejection
                                 are not relevant to Public Net operation
                                 yet.

                             (3) CKnode will be maintained, this is the
                                 definitive information source where
                                 production code resides.
    
                             (4) Dallas System 31 will close permanently
                                 on 1 March.

                             (5) See Section 4.4 for specific 
                                 information.

                             (6) SUN delivered several fixes for Server
                                 crashes.  System availability and 
                                 response time has improved.  Other
                                 measures being planned to bring more
                                 improvements.



      III.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            3.1  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update:  2/8  See Important News, point (2).   

            3.2  Failed Loads 

                 A.  Netcon has reported some load failures.  P. Michel,
                     on advice from STS, recommended a troubleshooting 
                     plan to Netcon to gather more information on load
                     failures.

                   Action:  2/1  NTD working with Netcon to trap "bus
                                 error".

                   Update:  2/8  L. Orona reports this problem is caused
                                 by a pool performing network line.
                                 See Important News, point 2.

            3.3  NAD BUG

                   Update:  2/8  See Important News, point (2).

            3.4  INTERACTIVE NAD 

                   Update: 11/30 The reason this script fails to operate 
                                 is UNIX NAD does not support switching 
                                 between command and interactive nodes.
                                 This is an explanation why some debugging
                                 scripts used on the PDP don't work, or 
                                 need modification, under UNIX.

                   Update:  2/8  See Important News, point (2).
                                 Contact NTD or QA to learn how UNIX NAD 
                                 supports this capability.

                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source, and access controls.

                                 BT Tymnet UNIX systems.

                   Update:  1/25 B. Soley advises significant delays to 
                                 produce this report.  
 
                   Action:  2/1  H. Matthews will attempt to get an 
                                 interim release.

                   Update:  2/8  NTD forwarding the report as written.

       VI.  SOFTWARE ORDERING AND FULFILLMENT PROCEDURES

                   Update: 11/30 A sub project is underway to modify 
                                 Tymnet information process so that all
                                 software shipments from the UNIX systems
                                 is initiated via the OES.

                   Update:  1/4  This project is near completion.  See
                                 J. Weisinger for details.  Full effect on
                                 private and subnets will be evident when
                                 all code gen PDP's are shut down.

                   Update:  2/1  Final document out to principals for 
                                 approval.
                                 
      VII.  BITS 4.0 AND 5.0

                   Update:  11/2 Scheduled delivery date 6 February '90.

                                 without UNIX migration team approval.

                   Update:  1/11 NTD removed a delivery from BITS 4 to 
                                 BITS 5.  BITS 4 delivery remains 1 march.

                   Update:  1/18 Design issues remain unresolved on BITS
                                 4.0.  NTD to consider and review options
                                 and reply.

                   Update:  2/1  New Requirements document is open for 
                                 comment.

                   Action:  2/1  D. Murtaugh and J. Snavely to approve or
                                 disapprove.



     VIII.  DOCUMENTATION

            A documentation area will be supplied under UNIX 
            consistent with the code release libraries.  The code
            release library structure is being defined with NTD Program
            Management.

       IX.  BITS AND NAD SUPPORT

            Open problem, NTD directly supports NAD and BITS 9-5 M-F,
            however, not 24 hours per day.

        X.  MALVERN BACKUP

            PI stated T and C files were not getting backed up.  This is
            a side effect of Server crashes and another SUN problem.

            Action:  J. Smith changed RDIST to begin more often and 
                     C. Fletcher will create a type of /Tym
                     and ship to Malvern.

                   Update:  2/8  Malvern is now holding a full backup of
                                 /Tym.

                             (2) BITS 3.00 and NAD 3.00 installed.  These
                                 releases should fix all known problems.
                                 FYI, use ticket system to report NAD and
                                 BITS faults.  See item IX for further
                                 details.

                             (3) CKnode will be maintained, this is the
                                 definitive information source where
                                 production code resides.
    
                             (4) Dallas System 31 will close permanently

                                 crashes.  System availability and 
                                 response time has improved.  Other
                                 measures being planned to bring more
                                 improvements.

                             (6) C. London participated in this meeting 
                                 and brought an important user 
                                 perspective.

      III.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            3.1  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update:  2/15 See Important News, point (2).  BITS
                                 3.00 is supposed to have this functional
                                 capability.  Item dropped.



            3.2  Failed Loads 

                 A.  Netcon has reported some load failures.  P. Michel,
                     on advice from STS, recommended a troubleshooting 
                     plan to Netcon to gather more information on load
                     failures.

                   Action:  2/1  NTD working with Netcon to trap "bus
                                 error".

                   Update:  2/8  L. Orona reports this problem is caused
                                 by poor performing network lines.
                                 See Important News, point 2.

                   Update:  2/15 This is a non UNIX issue.  Item dropped.

            3.3  NAD BUG

                   Update:  2/8  See Important News, point (2).

                   Update:  2/15 NAD 3.00 installed.  Item dropped.

            3.4  INTERACTIVE NAD 

                   Update: 11/30 The reason this script fails to operate 
                                 is UNIX NAD does not support switching 
                                 between command and interactive nodes.
                                 This is an explanation why some debugging
                                 scripts used on the PDP don't work, or 
                                 need modification, under UNIX.

                   Update:  2/8  See Important News, point (2).
                                 Contact NTD or QA to learn how UNIX NAD 
                                 supports this capability.

                   Update:  2/15 This capability is in NAD 3.00.  Item
                                 dropped.

       IV.  REMAINDER OF BT PUBLIC NET NODES (excluding Subnets)

                 Migration of PSC public net nodes and slots will begin in
                 mid to late January.

                 Responsible:  Alex Martel, Merton Marshall, Sal Spinale

                   Update:  2/16 PSC migration is complete.  Item dropped.

            4.2  ACS 

                   Update:  1/25 ACS stated all slots will be moved by 
                                 1 February.  OnTyme code movement 
                                 targeted by 15 February.

                  Responsible:  Tom Hackwood



                   Update:  1/18 ACS delivered a commitment to move all
                                 their nodes and slots by 1 February.

                   Update:  2/8  T. Hackwood stated redevelopment of 
                                 OnTyme Outdial will take 3 months.

            4.3  European Nodes 
                   
                   Update:  2/8  GNEO will migrate to SUN by 15 March.

                 Responsible:  J. Fowler

                   Action:  2/8  J. Oliveto to provide update on NISCNET
                                 moves.

                   Update:  2/15 NISCNET going to Subnet SUN's when
                                 available.  NIS will be removed from
                                 the Public Net SUN`s.

            4.4  Other Exceptions - FYI All shall be migrated to UNIX by
                 1 March.  

                 PDP-10 Bases - Action:  J. Smith to resolve gen problems.

                   Update:  2/15 These gen problems cannot be resolved
                                 without significant redevelopments of the
                                 engine base code and no one wants to put
                                 any efforts into this (with good reason).
                                 Therefore, J. Smith has made alternate
                                 arrangements to store base code on a 
                                 spare DEC 2020 to reload the bases until 
                                 all PDP 10's are shut down.

                 TMCS, Netval, Netconsole, RAM and Supes - 
                 Action:  L. Orona (Netcon) to ensure code backup. 

                   Action:  2/15 L. Orona to report migration progress at
                                 next meeting.

                 ALC Codes - Action:  STS (D. Ellenberg) to get the
                 problem fixed so these can be migrated.

                   Action:  2/15 D. Ellenberg to report migration progress
                                 at next meeting.

                 (P. Michel) is upgrading node code and ISIS.

                 Subnets - Action:  Marketing (J. McWalters) to develop
                 pricing.  There are two servers ready to begin these 
                 moves.

                 OnTyme Outdial - Action:  T. Hackwood, see 4.2.


        V.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update:  10/5 H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source, and access controls.

                   Update:  1/4  B. Soley is preparing a paper that 
                                 advises all measures for SUN System

                                 BT Tymnet UNIX systems.

                   Update:  1/25 B. Soley advises significant delays to 
                                 produce this report.  
 
                   Action:  2/1  H. Matthews will attempt to get an 
                                 interim release.

                   Update:  2/8  NTD forwarding the report as written.

       VI.  SOFTWARE ORDERING AND FULFILLMENT PROCEDURES

                   Update: 11/30 A sub project is underway to modify 
                                 Tymnet information process so that all
                                 software shipments from the UNIX systems
                                 is initiated via the OES.

                   Update:  1/4  This project is near completion.  See
                                 J. Weisinger for details.  Full effect on
                                 private and subnets will be evident when
                                 all code gen PDP's are shut down.

                   Update:  2/1  Final document out to principals for 
                                 approval.
                                 
      VII.  BITS 4.0 AND 5.0

                   Update:  12/7 New delivery date is now 2 March 1990.  
                                 Further schedule slips are not allowed
                                 without UNIX migration team approval.

                   Update:  1/11 NTD removed a delivery from BITS 4 to 
                                 BITS 5.  BITS 4 delivery remains 1 March.
                                 BITS 5 has no delivery date yet.

                   Action:  2/15 P. Whitehurst to provide BITS 5.0 
                                 delivery date.

                   Action:  2/1  D. Murtaugh and J. Snavely to approve or
                                 disapprove.

                   Update:  2/15 J. Snavely approved, D. Murtaugh has not 
                                 responded to BITS 5.0 design.  NTD 
                                 developing to the specs without all user
                                 sign off to meet their committed delivery
                                 dates.

     VIII.  DOCUMENTATION

            A documentation area will be supplied under UNIX 
            consistent with the code release libraries.  The code
            release library structure is being defined with NTD Program
            Management.

       IX.  BITS AND NAD SUPPORT

            Open problem, NTD directly supports NAD and BITS 9-5 M-F,
            however, 24 hours per day is required.

                   Update:  2/15 Gary Walker asserts STS supports these
                                 programs.  Escalate faults with these
                                 programs through the Trouble Ticket
                                 system.  Item dropped.

        X.  MALVERN BACKUP

            PI stated T and C files were not getting backed up.  This is
            a side effect of Server crashes and another SUN problem.

            Action:  J. Smith changed RDIST to begin more often and 
                     C. Fletcher will create a type of /Tym
                     and ship to Malvern.

                   Update:  2/8  Malvern is now holding a full backup of
                                 /Tym.

                   Action:  2/15 J. Smith to inform UNIX support group how
                                 to verify RDIST logs are functioning as
                                 designed.

       XI.  BITS DUMP TIME

                   Action:  2/15 Field to test and reply.

    The word is getting out! While we have felt for some time that we have
    been the market leader in packet-switching, industry experts are just
    coming to that realization. This is especially true now that the
    acquisition by British Telecom has been completed.
 
    The most recent proof of this can be found in the January issue of
    BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS REVIEW. In an article entitled "Tymnet
    and Telenet Regroup for the 1990s" (page 22), one of the introductory
    paragraphs states...
 
    "While Telenet is often cited as the market leader, the new combination
    of Tymnet's U.S. and worldwide base, plus the BT packet network in the
    U.K., propels the new organization, BT Tymnet, into the overall lead in
    providing X.25 packet-switched services."
 
    David Callisch of the public relations department was instrumental in
    setting up the writer from BCR to interview our own Ron Bamberg. The
    resulting article gives a good overview of the issues facing the VAN
    market in the coming years, and projects BT Tymnet in a leadership
    position.

RE:	CONTACT WITH THE MEDIA  II


In consideration of recent events, (McDonnell Douglas has filed suit against
British Telecom - see The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 30, 1990, C-19), it is more
important than ever that ALL CONTACT with the press be directed to the PUBLIC
RELATIONS OFFICE. 

If you receive any questions on this litigation, forward the journalist to:

Public Relations,  Barbara Burdick, 408-922-7602

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: Why "DO UPTXT" worked on 38 and 74 but not 30. 

The problem was in the INIT file.
F38 was not set up to run any INIT file,
F74 was set up to run (NETENTRY)INIT.SAV which does not exist on F74
(which was the cause of the "cannot run required program" at login).
F30 had an INIT file, but the "DO list" it created included some
directories that do not exist on F30: (MIDAS) and (XMAGNUM).
This resulted in an "Address check" instead of running the right program.

I have turned off the INIT file for NETENTRY on F30; that makes UPTXT
work again.  However, there may be a side effect of some terminal
parameters not be set up.  There are ways around that if needed.

Subject: Vida wants GFD records. 

Vida wants to track down the user which either did a DIR of INSCODE or
a GFD to INSCODE on systems 31 and 26 on Tuesday, Feb 6th.
I know you can ask SCREAM to report how many times (SYS)GFD was run, 
but how do we get it to report the destination directory?

I have updated (util)psppdp.sav to include system 56.  For now we will just

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



     
     In accordance with the plan of migration to the SUN's, a decision
has been made to permanently shut down host D31 on Thursday, March 1. 
     
     System F33 has been designated as the primary move destination   
host. *   
     
     System D31 users who are not valid on F33 will be moved during the    
weekend of February 23 starting at 16:00 PST.
     Please do not update any files on host D31 after this time as they    
will not be moved. Arrangements will be made with both Data Centers   
to have no scheduled downtime on hosts F26,F33 and D37 during    
the weekend of the move. Please use your back-up. 
     
     Dallas Operations will store these users to tape, and send tape  
to Fremont Data Center via Federal Express - Priority 1.    
                                                                Page  2

     
     Fremont Operations will restore to these directories on host F33.
     
     Resource Planning and Management (RPM) will run a storage check  
comparison to verify that an exact duplication has taken place for    
these users.   
     
     System D31 users who are already valid on host F33 prior to move,
must transfer their needed files onto host F33 or D37. 
     
     On Thursday, March 1 at 12:00 PST Dallas Operations will    
perform final ALLFILES on host D31. These tapes will contain ALL 
users directories and will be stored in the tape library, a copy 
will be sent to Fremont's tape library. 
     
     If there are any questions,clarifications, or need assistance,   
Please call me at (415)498-2515 or send an Ontyme to IPS.SRAMAIL 
     
     
     
     
* United Kingdom and recently moved Sub-nets will be moving to D37.   
  Details have already been sent to responsible parties.

Subject: LOADII error 14 for TMP file. 

I got a call from Ken Lumm saying that he could not run LOADII as user
FORDSUB - it died with 1022 error 14 while trying to create a TMP file.
Error 14 from the Monitor means "disk full or quota exceeded".  I had
him "R QUOTA" (which is a copy of SYS:QUOLST.SHR) which showed him as
being 60 pages over quota.  It went OK after he deleted some files.

Note to Craig: Anytime you get a call from a PDP-10 user being unable
to create a file, have them "R QUOTA" and check if reports any
negative numbers.

I got a call from Lois Lindley about "NO PASSWORD FILE" for the OPER command.
It had a creation date of today at 1:32pm and had no license.  I noticed
a job logged in as OPER running TITO that did not have WC license set.
(SYS)DRWSPR.EPO now fixed - what was wrong with it?

Subject: Host 32 and other PDP-10 systems. 

I was looking at the database in NETDB on system 23 and found the following
discrepancies:

Node 6415: delete host 38, add host 34.
Node 6720: delete host 58, add host 32.
Node 7004 is pending, will have host 56 around the 1st of April
Node 7021: add host 38.

The following nodes all belong to the Fremont Data Center:
Node 2333 (host 33), node 3374 (host 23), node 6415 (host 34),
node 6720 (host 32), node 6721 (host 30), node 6722 (host 74),
node 7004 (host 56), node 7021 (host 38), and node 10350 (host 26).
They should all have the same cost code, it may be code 2018.

The following nodes belong to the Dallas Data Center:
Node 3115 (host 37) and node 4725 (old host 56).

I am the C.S. responsible for slots 1 and 2 on each of those nodes.
