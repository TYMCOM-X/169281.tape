Subject: ZISC 

The March 1988 issue of BYTE magazine has an article on a ZISC that plugs into
the Compaq 386/20 PC and costs $1999.  It's called the Weitek WTL 1167
Math Coprocessor Board.  You store one operand in the chip by writing to a
magic location.  When you write the second operand in another magic location,
poof!  The two floating-point numbers are added and their sum appears at a
third magic location.  The 80386 thinks it's simply doing load/store
operations on memory that happens to have a few wait states.

Subject: PEAK 

Joe,
  The newer versions of PEAK (such as that on F33) support tty class SUN,
which behaves better than telling things that a shell-tool window is a
VT100.  I tried telecopying (SYS)PEAK.SAV to my directory on 37, but I
obviously need to do something more that that...  I tried a get and ssave,
with no more luck, but I probably wasn't getting the right thing.
Is there anything special that needs to be done to build a special copy
of peak, or is it reasonable to just install the new version everywhere?
  By the way, a datascope we were using tells us that it takes at least
180 milliseconds to get a packet through a node.  It also tells us that
the last byte of one packet arrived after the first byte of the next
packet on the same line, although the packets are integral, contiguous
things.  It doesn't seem to keep time in even a partial-order...

Subject: OHTFUL = Spurious usermode parity error. 

If the PC was in usermode at the time a parity error was detected and the
memory scan routine can't find the word with the parity error, all of the
user's core is marked as bad.  Due to the unfortunate way that "bad" is
reported as having a disk I/O error, all these pages get stored in the OHT
(Output Hash Table).  If the user's core image had more that 63 pages, we
die with OHTFUL.  To check for this condition in the crash, look at:
  PARPC = PC from CH1 at time of parity error.  10000 in LH if user mode
  SAVERA = nonzero if parity error
  SAVSB0+1 = SBUS diag.

CRA013, CRA014, and CRA015 on X32 match this description.

Subject: The null job is not running on D34. 

SY says that D34 is 100% used.  it lies.  
Many user jobs in the RN queue are not getting any run time, not even the
null job.  PAM has 11 hours of idle time; meaning it has not executed any UUOs
during that time even though it is in a RN state.  Since it is not racking
up TRUs, it is not getting any CPU time.  And when CHKPNT gets stuck, all
user programs eventually grind to a halt in the AC state, waiting on the
ACT: device.  Last night I attached to CHKPNT but it did not output its
"CHKPNT shutting down" message because it was stuck in this funny RN state.

Somebody killed (PERPOPER) running XEXEC at 12:40pm Saturday afternoon.
This means that no SUBMIT jobs were running, and may have had something to
do with the MAGNUM problems.  (There are some SUBMIT jobs that NETDB runs
to keep the MAGNUM database intact.)  

There should be a job running XEXEC at all times.  Send mail to CRALST if
XEXEC stops running.   /Joe

Subject: FORTRAN libraries 

Joe,
  I don't know who maintains this aspect of the 10s, but the FORTRAN library
(SYS)LIB40.REL on F33 seems to be unique.  It has a later creation date (by
4 years) than on other systems (I checked 39, 55 and 56) and at least one
routine (GETC, to read a character from a circuit) is different and seems
to cause IMR user crashes.
  I was able to link in DDT using the monitor DEBUG command and then save
the file, but running LINK seemed to produce a number of errors, which may
also have been due to the different library.  I had thought that the LOAD
command invoked the linker, so don't understand why I get errors when
running LINK but not when using the LOAD facility.
  It seems that Don Murtaugh added the 1022 stuff on his own, in response
to an off-hand comment by Les Seltzer about wanting some statistics about
LOADII usage for CMF development.  Dan Lasater apparently had nothing to do
with this, and the release notes reflect what NTD did.  I'm tempted to build
the release version and install that as an alternate.

Subject: Changing BUBBNET passwords. 

I have not been able to change my BUBBNET password.  The PASSWO program on
(SYS:39) fails with "?lost sync with CUD slave".  On 16-Nov, I logged into
host 83 directly to change my password.  It accepted the change, but the
SUP hasn't been notified.  I did this again on 18-Nov, and again today, but
the BUBBNET sup is still expecting my 3-month old password.

What is the procedure required to notify all the SUPs of a change of password?
Could the PASSWORD program on 39 be modified so that LOG-II is handled 
transparently?  It's a little disconcerting to have to use one of 2 passwords
based on the phase of the moon (or other nondeterministic factors).

		/Joe Smith

(end forwarded message)

The format of the MUD is completely different on a LOG-II supervisor as
compared to the traditional LOG-I sup.  Since Bubbnet is running both types,
they can't run a MUD consistency check.  Very confusing.  /Joe

Did you log into 38 (the LOG II netval) to change your password their
too.  I believe sup 6, the LOG II sup, has been up most of the 
time.  Yes, it is a royal pain to go through both.  Their is a 
problem on 39 that is being addressed.

Good luck.

I found what was causing the message to look funny.
	?System date error suspected.
	?Mail for  aged 82 days.
	?System date = 9091, File date = 1

The string variable UFDname was not set up and there was an ampersand instead
of comma at the end of the line.  This doesn't fix the original bug, but should
make it easer to track down.

     Users who are valid exclusively on F-29 will be moved to Fremont's

their OWN files to another PDP-10 system they are valid on.

     It has not yet been determined when AT&T users will be moving to 
system 74.  The appropriate people will be contacted when it has been
decided.

     Tapes assigned to F-29 will be transferred to F-74 unless users
request an alternate system.  Please type file (TAPEDIR:74)TAPES.29

Subject: ref: EBUS 

I got a call on Friday from someone in TYMNET (I forget her name at the
moment, anyway) trying to determine exactly WHO is responsible for the
maintenance of EBUS and/or IPI, because there is some need to have the
source code moved/archived/translated to SUN.

I also recall Joe mentioning that porting EBUS to SUN s a waste, since
it is only necessary as long as the PDP-10's are around anyway...

Anyway, I wanted to mention this to everyone since, this is YET ANOTHER
area that we can make a precedence for field service company.

/Carl

PS. If I didn't make it clear, I was told that she was told that no one in
    NTD is responsible for EBUS and they may already think that we are the
    people that maintain it.  (However, THAT may not be official, YET!)

Joe:  Comment?  Did she also call you?  I gave her your number in bldg. F.

I think all that has to be done to more to 74 is change the home system for the

Subject: Need name KSDIAG on F33. 

Jan or Landa, I need username KSDIAG validated on F33.  It should have the
same settings as KS2020:33 except that it needs only 2000 pages.  This
directory is needed as a backup for KS-2020 diagnostics.

We are looking for a third party hardware service and maintenance to
provide post warrenty repairs on our (mostly Sun-3) workstations.
Would appreciate any/all info.   

Also, we have a number of ASCII, VT-100 compatible terminals
(DEC VT-220s, Wyse 75s, CIE 101s, and FALCOs) that are no longer
needed (even though they are far more reliable than our 3/50 and
3/60s !). These are available to the best offer.

Subject: Re: 1022 on system 31 

Joe,
  i didn't get a chance to tell you...

  Apparently, 1022 or (UPL)FTX22 has not been used for awhile on system 31.
According to Linda F. in SRA, Fremont.... UPL has been almost empty (15 files)
for over a year.  About 4 months ago, 1022.ERR (or FTX22.ERR) appeared.

  I guess whatever problem Don M. Had with LOADII caused him to try to run
(UPL)FTX22 to try to fixup the damage to the LOADII data file.  FTX22 was NOT
there and he called Ed Roop about this.

  Julian Min tried copying FTX22 and it's files to D31 from F74 but he only
copied some of the necessary files, so it still didn't work.  I copied the
entire set of programs from F74 and everything was working this morning
as of about 4:am (monday) as far as 1022 is concerned.

  I don't believe the .ERR file is that important, but I don't know for
sure.  Anyway, No Don can fix any problems that occur with LOADII's .DMS
database file. ^^^ (NOW!) ^^^  [I'm tired and don't want to fix the line!]


Let me know if there are any more reported problems.

/Carl
