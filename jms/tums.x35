In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 2 Oct 87 20:02:16 PDT

I've moved ROUTER.NET to (MAIL:29) so that will be the master copy.  If
you need to make changes regarding the PDP-10's, please make them in the
source file and then do a
    PCOM ROUTER
to spread it around.  RDIST in (MAIL) is a special kludge copy to deal
with gateways so it will even update 39.  If you would like any non-PDP-10
changes made, please check with me.  

Thanks for letting me know about 14, 17, 32.

-Bill

Subject: F26 survived a base reload! 

F26's base was having problems (many jobs running LOGINN in TI state) and
it was reloaded.  Host 26 was not available thru net because the EBUS base
was waiting for the PDP10 to tell it what host number to use.  From KLDCP
I was able to deposit a host-to-base message in the ORING specifying the
host number and 127 ports.  When ORPPDP was poked, host 26 became visible.
OPER could log in, but others couldn't because the base thought the PDP10
was SHUT but F26 thought it had answered.  Setting SCHED 400000 and SCHED 0
cleared up that misconception.  I will add the code to send the right
messages to SCNSER; it may be worth adding a DDT patch to all P035/C when
it's ready.  /Joe

I found 2 bugs in PAKCOP(PAKCP5).   
If the 1st string controller is off-line (BPA0-BPA7), then PAKCOP assumes
the entire 3674 controller is off-line (BPA0-17 & BPB0-17).  PAKCP5 didnot
want to look at the string of 3650 disks on BPA10-17 as a result of
the string of 3675 disk on BPA0-7 being switched off.

2nd problem: Although I tried to make PAKCOP do everything SA10NW does,
something is missing.  Those paacks have not been formatted using PAKCOP,
because PAKCOP dies on CYL 559 with "Equip Check".    They were formatted with
SA10NW with FMTM=0, wich does cylinders 0-554 only.  When I tried FMTM=1,
SA10NW aborted because cylinders 555-559 were not set up.  I am now using
FMTM=-1 to re-write HA and R0 - this takes 2 secons per cylinder, 19 minutes
per pack.  After SA10NW finished, thhen I reformat thhem in pages.
I plan do do all but BPA16 - I'll leave that one as a test case for the
next version of PAKCOP.			/Joe

a.  HOW DO YOU FEEL THE SEMINAR WAS PRESENTED?

    THE SEMINAR WAS PRESENTED IN A WELL-ROUNDED MANNER.
NOT ONLY DID THE CLASS LEARN ABOUT BASIC OPERATOR FUNCTIONS
AND THIER IMPORTANCE, BUT ALSO THE FUNCTIONS OF SOFTWARE
SUPPORT AND FIELD SERVICE AND THE WAY IN WHICH ALL GROUPS
INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.

b.  DO YOU FEEL THE SEMINAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER?

    THE SEMINAR ON THE 10'S LASTED ONE WEEK.  THE AMOUNT OF
MATERIAL COVERED SEEMED TO BE SUFFICIENT. ALTHOUGH CLASS WAS
DISMISSED EARLY EVERYDAY (WHICH THE OPERATORS DIDNT MIND)
SOME OF THAT TIME COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO MORE USE.

c.  WHAT DID YOU GET OUT OF THE SEMINAR?

    THE SEMINAR PRESENTED MUCH INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE WERE         
UNAWARE OF. FOR EXAMPLE: DIFFERENT COMMANDS AND THIER MEANINGS,
HARDWARE CONFIGURATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING IT,
DAILY DUTIES AND AN IN DEPTH EXPLANATION OF WHY THEY ARE DONE.

d.  INCLUDE OTHER COMMENTS YOU FEEL ARTINENT.

    OVER ALL, THE PDP10 SEMINAR WAS GOOD.  IT LED ME TO UNDERSTAND
THE SYSTEM BETTER AND THE ACTUAL IMPORTANCE OF MY JOB.  ALTHOUGH
THE FIRST SEMINAR DID COVER A LOT, THE INSTRUCTORS MIGHT WANT TO THINK
ABOUT SPENDING MORE TIME ON BASIC COMMANDS (ESPECIALLY THE BT COMMAND)
AND ALSO HARDWARE  CONFIGURATION.

=====================================================================

This is the class evaluation from Rick Daniels.  It looks good.

A minor typo was found in /C05 which caused LDBLOG to report the wrong node
number on PTYs (such as SUBMIT jobs).  (M33)C05.PAT has been applied to all
copies of ##XC05.SAV and to NEWMON.SAV on all Fremont systems.  74XC05.SAV
had to be rebuilt with 127 jobs instead of 128 to handle 4 strings of 3675
disks.  We expect P035/C05 on all Fremont machines on Sunday.  /Joe

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Tymnet Training and Education schedule for the 1st quarter '88
is now available via ontyme  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL

As a result of your feedback after class and the recommendations of the
training advisory task forces we have made some changes in our
courses.

  1.  The length of  TTE 455 Utilities Code Generation has been
      increased to 8 days to provide more time for hands-on labs.

  2.  SmarTym has been added to the TTE 230 Tymnet 3270/CMT/SmarTym
      course and the length has been extended to 8 days.

  3.  The name of TTE 260 has been changed to Async Error Correction, we
      now cover X.PC, Network Server, Menu Server and 2 new
      protocols - MNP & AFT

  4.  The CPU III, MAC III and Nano engine were added to the TTE 330
      TYMNET Hardware Maintenance and Troubleshooting.

  5.  The requirement for either TTE 455 or TTE 445 as a prerequisite 
      for TTE 450 has been revised.

The enrollment procedure remains the same - use  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
In the last quarter we had some students show up who were not on our
roster.  Please be sure to send an enrollment form at least 5 weeks 
before your class.  That way we will be sure we have enough materials
and lab equipment available for you.  You should receive confirmation of
your enrollment within 2 days of your registration.

We look forward to seeing you in class next quarter.  If you have any
questions about the schedule or prerequisite courses, please give us a
call.  Our new phone number is (408) 922-7620


Sincerely,

Robert C. Grandey

Subject: Device not available fixed. 

If you "DO BACKUP" on one job, and "DO PRINT" on a different one, then ti
command "UNLOAD BACKUP:" gets "Device not available - BACKUP".  Therefore I
removed the offending line from BACKUP.MIC.  You shouldn't see the problem
anymore.

As to TOPS-20 documentation, we have some but they are many years out of date.
You should be getting a complete set of Software Notebooks with the 2065
hardware.  I will send a list of suggested manual names later.  /Joe

In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 3 Dec 87 3:47:07 PST

The message "Bits 18,19,20 disabled cannot swap" should be interpreted as
"disk full or quota exceeded".  User UKMKTG on F26 has a quota of 5000 pages
and is currently using 5030 pages.  The easy way of checking this is to
GFD to that directory and "R QUOLST".
UKMKTG will not be able to created any new files until either
a) some old files are deleted, or
b) the logged in quota is increased and the user logs out and back in again.
