Subject: "MAILER not running on D25 since"... 

MAILER not running on D25 since 21-Jul is the cause of the late and
duplicate mail.  When the system rebuild completed at 6:34am on
Friday, 21-Jul-89, MAILER tried to run be did not have enough license.
Someone did not have WC license while restoring files in directory
(MAIL).

If the system is brought up in CONSOLE mode, the command "SET LICENSE"
will give the job all the license in the world.  But when the system
is up in the network while restoring, operations needs to use the special
oper name that has all licenses, or call TYMCOM-X Software Support to
have license set for the restore job.
