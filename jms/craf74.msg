Will be backing off of (SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all hosts until Hardware/Support
personnel can come to an understanding of what is going on.

F22 has gone down twice with the CPU stopcode AR/ARX already today.  Cannot
have system going down this frequently with this stopcode.

Let's get together ASAP and determine which way we are to go with 
monitors.

Thanks Rick

Since F74 has been up on NEWMON, there has been THREE crashes (3, 4, and 5).

Are these related to the NEWMON or the updated EBUS code that wasloaded
at the same time?

ThansIf system goes down one more time, we will back off of NEWMON and
bring up on SYSTEM monitor.

Thanks Rick Daniels

System 74 has been brought with SYSTEM.SAV.  Plans are that if
anymore "CIRCUITS NOT RESPONDING" message print out on SUPCHK, the
EBUS will be loaded with OLD code and system brought up on NEWMON.SAV.
Tyring to determine what is causing crashes.

I agree.  Hold off on NEWMON until we have had a chance to analyze every
one of the crashes from /D06.

   EARLIER IN THE DAY THE SYSTEM GOT A REDSAT MESSAGE AND

   AND DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY AND CLEAN SYSTEM UP.
   BPA16 SAYS IT GOES OFFLINE AND BACK ONLINE AGAIN. THIS HAPPENS
   AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
   NEVER ANY THUNGS. THE SYSTEM CAME UP WITH 2 FILES THAT LOST
   DATA. THEY WILL BE RESTORED. IT ALSO CAME UP WITH A RIBERR

Ken san,
 
Thank you for your support on our service on F74.
 
Right now, NIS found some file problems on F74.
Please pass this OnTyme to appropriate person.
 
Flat file problem:
 
        From Jul's 25th evening to 26th evening in JST, files  (MPPC:74)
        SHOHI.A29 and/or SHOHI.X29 were garbled. They are the element of ISAM
        and I don't know which one (or both) is garbled. 
        Yesterday, the user who is the owner of the username MPPC pointed out
        that illegal figures appeared in their reports. So, NIS checked, found
        the problem, and could recovered.
        Now, NIS is requested to explain the cause of the problem by the user,
        because he know troubles on Jul, (04th, 06th, and 21st), and is afraid
        of reliability of our host.
        
        Please check and let me know what was happened.
 
MAGNUM problem:
 
        Kazuo Watanabe got the all files of MVX:74 at 18th JUl from the backup
        files of the Fremont center, and we found the MAGNUM error at the 
        execution of programs on the (restored) MAGNUM. From 18th to 20th Jul,
        we could execute the programs without problem every day.
        I attached the execution log with this OnTyme, so please check it.
        You can find the fatal MAGNUM error at the middle of the log.
 
        So the MAGNUM is seeemed to still have a problem. Please check and 
        advise me.
 
        Also, Mike Bellopatrick mentioned in his OnTyme #A25087 about the
        missing MAGNUM file on MVX:74, so please let me know what kind of file
        is missed, and it's id if possioble.  ######.M??    .... ?
 
Again MAGNUM problem:
 
        Today, we found a magnum text file P.REP01(exec level id is MG5WI9.ME2)
        of TYMPAS (the name of the schema) on NETBILL:74 was garbled without
        explicit file modification in past 2 weeks. About the file, no warning
        is indicated. Regarding the file, it is recoverble, however we are
        afraid that there are this kind of silent garbled files which are not
        found by our check, yet.
 
All those problems have no explicit relation with the trouble on 21st Jul,
we can only supporse they were caused by it, however it is the fact that
after the trouble, we find this kind of file (especially MAGNUM file)
problems frequently. We feel something was wrong on F74. So please check it 
again and let me know the status.
 
At this moment, we find the problem on MAGNUM in MVX:74 and NETBILL:74.
And I hope no more MAGNUM id which has the problem appeared.
 
Best regards,
Makoto

     Ogura-san, received your Ontyme of today regarding F74 file problems.
     Rick Daniels is not in office today, so I cannot obtain additional
     information at this time.
 
     I am unclear as to the reliability of F74 Disk drives this week.
     Hopefully Rick and/or Mike Bellopatrick can supply you with present
     status, if this problem has continued during recent days.
 
     For your information, I've not seen message A25087 from Mike.
 
     As I'm sure you realize, we do not have personnel here to analyze and
     solve Magnum problems.  If the issues relate to hardware, IPC Ops.
     can respond accordingly; if they involve Tymcom X software other
     than Magnum, the Tymcom X Support group can analyze and solve.
 
     Accordingly, I'm requesting that Rick supply you with an update on
     the present status of F74 hardware problems, as they may be responsi-
     ble for the problems you're experiencing.
 
     Regards. Ken

Makoto;

Read through your Ontyme  M79463 today.  I do not know that much about
MAGNUM, only enough to clear up errors that we may have on our own, which
I learned from the MAGNUM Group that use to be here.

What I did this morning is the following:

The last change to relation SHOHIN.FIL terminated abnormally.
Some of the last changes have possible been lost.
The structure of the RELATION has possible also been damaged.
Do you want MAGNUM to attempt RELATION structure recovery?  I answered Y here.
Structure recovery is complete.
The RELATION structure is internally consistent, however,
Data loss may have occurred.  Execution proceeds.

The last change to relation GOZAN.FIL terminated abnormally.

(The same recovery procedures reported here and I did the same as above)

The last change to relation BUSHU.FIL terminated abnormally.

As menioned before, there may still be some files garbled on System 74,
but we have no way of knowing which ones until the USERS lets  us know.

The files can be restored if the Users know which ones they are from the
lastest all-files and backups.  Even after doing this, the User may have to
recreate some files.

Fremont Data Center needs to schedule this system down for the next three
Fridays in order to check-out/replace some HDA's  It is imperative that
system 74 be scheduled down this coming Friday to start this work.

Thanks Rick Daniels

     Ogura-san, Rick sent a partial response (A28772) earlier today on
     subject.
 
     I know you and your customers are anxious to resolve recent problems
     related to host F74.  As Rick mentioned in his message, this host
     must be taken down for preventive maintenance on Friday for the
     next few weeks.
 
     Next Friday will be the first such maintenance, therefore F74 will be
     down during following period:
 
      Friday, August 5th, 1600-2100 PDT
      Saturday, August 6th, 0800-1300 JST
 
     Although this may be an inconvenience for clients which access host
     F74 on Saturday morning, it is absolutely necessary if we are to
     clear up the disk problems which have been evidenced on this host.
 
     Best regards. Ken

Rick and Ken san,   
     
Thank you for your investigation about the problem.    
However, the problem is growing more and more seriously for NIS. 
     
Today we found other problems on F74 regarding the MAGNUM files. 
     
1. MFUDO  
     
        Another garbled MAGNUM relation file of a customer was found this  
        morning. The relation is PLAC.FIL of MFSAIS(schema) on MFUDO:74.   
        The MFSAIS sesmed to be OK past one week, however last night monthly    
        reporting process on MFSAIS was executed and the garbling was found.    
        The file was heavy damaged and was very hard to recover. 
     
        Also we found some strange matter that the relation had 2 instances
        for one key value!!  For long time, we believe the key is an unique
        value insuch kind of file, but today we knew it was not fit the    
        actual filing system. 
        I've copied the all in the schema into username NISADM:74.    
        So please check it by yourself as follows.
     
                -GFD NISADM   
                -MAGNUM MFSAIS
                :DO FILE OGURA.CHK 
     
        Then you can get 2 instances which have the same key value.   
     
        Anyway Tadashi Takahashi is working to recoverthe MFUDO's system,  
        but he expects it is hard to recover whole data on the D/B and we  
        may be requested some compensation from the customer for the lost  
        of the data.
     
2. MPPC   
     
        A procedure of schema AIS on MPPC:74 had been broken sometime and  
        the last night's overnight execution was aborted by it.  
        So this morning, we, the customer and NIS, had to check the system 
        and made recovery shoot.   
        About the matter, we were complained by the customer because the delay  
        of reporting with checking and recovery was very critical for their
        monthly reporting processing which was done just this period of the
        month. 
        And, for the past few month, this user faced host problem at their 
        monthly processing every month. 
     
3. MAGNUM Command problem
     
        Some MAGNUM commands like  
                CRE .....
                BACKUP ....   
        are not enable, and (after we made arrangement to get the logging for   
        it) after re-login we find the commands work without problem. 
     
        About the matter, we have no evidence, however we experienced the  
        same problem few days ago. 
     
4. MVX    
     
        Schema AIS of MVX, as I mentioned many times in my OnTyme, was prepared 
        for some important project of NIS. But, as I mentioned too, it was 
        heavily garbled. So Kazuo Watanabe let it to go back at 18th Jul and    
        tried to execute 18th, 19th, and 20th operation on the schema.
        However it was failed by MAGNUM FATAL ERROR.   
        Andtoday, he tried to recompile schema and found also the MAGNUM FATAL  
        ERROR. 
     
5. Internal Billing 
     
        Our internal billing system is also damaged. (Maybe recoverble)    
     
     
From the observation of F74and MAGNUM past 2 weeks, we feel they are very  
un-stable. And the check for the machine, as Rick mentioned, is needed for 
the current and future service.    
However, please advise us what you can do for the those garbled files and  
systems.  
     
We feel and afraid that we find more non-awared garbling for the coming two
weeks, because the almost of monthly processing of the users are going to be    
executed for that period.
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

     Ogura-san, received your latest memo regarding F74 Magnum problems.
 
     Although we all appreciate and sympathize with the problems you are
     experiencing with Magnum internal file corruption, we can do little
     or nothing to solve the problems associated with Magnum code or
     files.
 
     As I have mentioned in past Ontymes, we have no remaining expertise
     with Magnum here at our facility, or anywhere in the U.S. for that
     matter.
 
     It is my feeling that NIS has the Magnum knowledge necessary to ana-
     lyze and correct the problems better than anyone else (i.e. re. MFUDO
     relation which reflects 2 instances for one key value: I assume it
     will be necessary to dump the relation to a 'flat' file and make nec-
     essary adjustments).
 
     However, we also realize the problems you are reporting are due to
     hardware disk failures on host F74.  Operations and the maintenance
     staff are doing everything possible to remedy these problems.
 
     I strongly suggest you keep close records of all problems, for future
     credit request requirements, and keep me posted on these problems if
     you wish.

     I'm not trying to discourage your communication to us on such issues,
     but wish to emphasize that we can do very little to assist you in
     resolving Magnum file corruption problems.
 
     We're all hopeful the hardware problems will be resolved soon.
 
     Best regards. Ken

Ken san,  
     
Thank you for your OnTyme.    
     
Today we could get more information about the current MAGNUM atatus.  
     
MAGNUM commands as  
     
        COPY TEXT .... TO FILE ....       and
        BACKUP ......  TO ......   
     
are not available on some schemas with error message "User Directory Access
Error", and available on other schemas. It depends on the directory which the   
schema is located. And if the destinaton file is not-existing (i.e. new) file,  
the problem is not appeared.  
The  problem is reproducable on the specific schema as 
     
                ONTYME.DB on DISTRICT239:74, 
                MMCAIS    on MMETAL:74, and etc.  
     
We guess the matter points is a part of MAGNUM copy mechanism which copies 
a MAGNUM file to a exec file as new file. And also, we found , on the same 
schema, a mechanism reading record from MAGNUM file and writing it onto exec    
(new) file works without problem, because    
     
        LIST FROM ..... TO ..... and    
        MAGNUM report writing 
     
has no problem.
     
I tried the COPY and BACKUP commands after the schema recompiling, however 
the problem still be appeared.
     
     
As you understand, this problem is very serious for NIS and reliability of 
MDC's RCS service in Japan.   
     
     
After host moving to F74 last autumn, we experienced heavy host problems every  
half a year, the cash memory trouble for over two months at the begin of this   
year and this disk un-reliability problem from Jun.    
Then our customers are going to feel something critical to operate their   
system, especially the financial system, on our service.    
     
I wonder that someone in IPC mentioned his MAGNUM on F74 had no problem, and    
hope he has no hidden problem as we are having.   
     
We know, you have no team for MAGNUM at this moment, however Mr. Matsumori,
the president of NIS, may not agree to pay the MAGNUM fee for such unstable
MAGNUM service and support, but may indicate some compensation from MDC for NIS.
     
At this moment, we can't evaluate the current MAGNUM on F74 run normally or not,
and only thing we need it to offer stable MAGNUM service to the customers. 
The simple example of the stable service is that the MAGNUM command, which 
I mentioned above,should work normally in anytime in any schema. 
     
Can we continue the MAGNUM service on F74 or should we change the service host  
to another host(X) ?
     
Please advise us.   
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Ken san,  
     
Over Saturday and Sunday, we checked major relations and procedures of
customers on F74 by recompiling the procedures and accessing all instances 
for the relations. And we found several problem, however they were recovered.   
     
MFUDO's Problem
     
  However, about MFUDO's schema, by this moment, NIS can't complete to recover  
  it's destroyed data even though Tadashi Takahashi tried to do for last three  
  days.   
     
Problem   
     
  Right now, we still have the system reliability problem of MAGNUM.  
     
        1. Kazuo Watanabe recreated (NOT only recompile schema) the schema on   
           MVX:74, and found some program on the schema run normally sometime,  
           and run abnormally sometime without explicit changing for the program
           and execution environment.   
     
        2. And, I'm not sure this is related with the current problem, one of   
           person reported that temp files which was created by MAGNUM are still
           remained when he logged off all usernames related the directory (at  
           Saturday ecening) then logged in again (at Monday morning).
     
  I'm sorry I can not indicate the evidence for both case, but I feel something 
  unstable about F74 and MAGNUM.   
     
The Current Status  
     
  Again at this moment we can't evaluate what is incorrect. 
     
        - The current MAGNUM processer ?
        - Individual files on the MAGNUM schema ? 
        - Something others ?  
     
  Please set up the MAGNUM processer in normal status, or please point out 
  what is wrong if the cause is being outside of the MAGNUM.
     
     
Counter Plan   
     
  To avoid future problem, I'd like to discuss following matters.
     
        1. Moving host from F74 to other host.    
           Because almost of the current problems are believed to come from
           the disk problem. If we can get another host, the MAGNUM on that
           host works without problem. (Of cource, the support for MAGNUM has   
           still problem.)    
     
        2. Special BACKUPs for NIS's customer
           We supporse the backup operation at the center is taken when our
           our customers are operating their files by the time difference  
           between Japan and USA. So the restore operation from the backups
           is very complicated. Please arrange Following special backup for
           NIS.
     
                - NIS indicates file-list file containing username and file
                  ids.   
                - NIS indicates username-list file containing usernames.   
                - Center execute backup for all files indicated in the file-    
                  list file at 06:00 JST (Start 06:00 JST, and end the
                  operation within two hours, if possible.) every day through   
                  Monday to Friday/Saturday in JST.    
                - Center execute backup for all files under the usernames  
                  indicating in the username-list file at 06:00 of Sunday JST.  
                - All data should be remained for one month. (i.e. it's need    
                  31 Mag Tapes for this operation.)    
                - Backup information (backup starting time, backup ending time, 
                  file-ids, file creation date & time, size, etc.) for every    
                  operation is informed to NIS as on-line file just after the   
                  operation.  
           By above mechanism, we can easly follow the problem speedy.
           If this is feasible, we will discuss on details and charges.    
     
  How do you think about the matters ?  
     
Charges   
     
  Regarding the problem, we user a huge amount of TRUs by checking and
  recovering as compiling, programing, test run, and etc. And NIS will intend   
  to negotiate about the charges and costs after everything is over.  
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Subject: F74 SAT.SYS rebuild 

This afternoon, I had to rebuild the RIB to SYS:SAT.SYS while the system
was still up.  They had a SATRED error for a sat-page on logical unit 4.
The page was legitimately bad, could not read/write it.  I suggested they
PAKCPY it out as soon as possible, since DSKCLN would get upset trying to
re-write the SATs the next DSKCLN.

While checking, I looked at the rib, and gee-golly-oh-my it was garbage!
I was going to clear HRE on SAT.SYS initially, but hmmm...  So, I told
Rick what was going on and began the repair.  I rebuilt it using the RIB
from system F33 (also 365x's formatted in pages) as the template.
  Details:  Used PEAK to create FOO.DDT showing all page pointers then
            ^Y (read command file in DDT) in TSTSUP to do most of the
            typing in... 18 units x 13 page pointers ...

Anyway, all said and done, the system crashed for SAT2ND on a different
page on the same logical unit 4, before I could clear HRE from the status
bits in [1,4]UFD entry for SAT.SYS.  DSKCLN found my reconstructed RIB
to specification and the system came up.  I then fixed the UFD entry.

Again, if this tool we talked about last week existed, the reconstruction
would not have been necessary, a simple page copy would have been enough!

System: F74 FFF - could not find system structure

Ali had been called in after 9:30pm due to BADSAT/WRTSAT/etc. crashes and
after getting KL10 Halted a number of times trying to reboot the system
he decided to swap hardware from DDD to FFF.

F74 on FFF is now running full dskcln with no apparent problems (as of this
writing).


Ali beleives the problem is somewhere in the CPU...SA10 path since FFF is
not having any problems.  Anyway, since it it presumed to be HARDWARE, we
are off the case until further notice.

We were called prior to Ali's notification that F74 was running dskcln. I
was talking to Bonnie Terry when operations was notified of this information.

Subject: "Previous message did NOT include"... 

Previous message did NOT include very important part of APRFAT stopcode.

Please, people, when reporting an APRFAT stopcode, include the reason for
the APRFAT.  I designed the stopcode output to surround the most important
piece of information with a box of asterisks so it would stand out.
But almost every single an APRFAT is reported, you people keep leaving
out this critical line!  I feel like I'm beatin my head agains the wall.

The crashmail for F74 should have included the following:

?CPU stopcode "APRFAT" at 09-Jan-1990 01:55:34 
F74, hardware DDD, KL-1354, base 6722, F74-P035/E-1, 3-2-89, M02603

Rick asked me to look at it this afternoon (around 3pm) and I found NO real
problems.  Files in RECOV.SYS were all normal files, a couple with holes...
I told Rick that my findings matched Joe's ... nothing apparent.

I beeped the group, taking over for Joe until he's better, he can beep us
when he's ready and back on his feet.  (No, you don't owe me for it this time)

I also left my beeper in my office, so I advised Fremont Ops to call me at home
until tomorrow morning if there are any problems, rather than beeping us.

The system appears to have stayed up since this afternoon...

Unit 301, DSKB14, Pack ID 740012 has a bad spot on it which prevents

from being copied to another Unit.

Can a ONE-PACK ASP dump be taken of this Unit and then readdress

Unit 315 as Unit 301, Unit 301 as Unit 315 and then restore the

ASP dump.  After the restore then readdress Unit 301 back to 315

and 315 back to 301?

I'm taking this one step at a time.

Another way is to take the ONE-PACK ASP dump, replace the HDA, and

restore the tape after the HDA has been DSF and checked out.

The most drastic way is to perform a rebuild and leave UNIT

301 out altogether.

Let me know your answer before Tuesday morning.

Subject: yet another way

Rick,
  I believe that if you do want to move to a drive on another string...
(That wasn't clear from the unit numbers...my obfuscation!)
. you can install the new HDA, zformat the new HDA, make sure it isn't
labelled DSKBxx and put it on-line and bring up the syste for your ASP.

Copy the drive, eg. DSKB14, or BPA1  to tape.
Copy the tape to the new drive, BPA15  (must be a physical name).

Halt the CPU and take the old drive off-line.

Re-boot the system.  The new drive will respond with the correct DSKBxx
address and it's label will say BPA1 although it will be BPA15, but the
system doesn't care what the label says.  (I'm fuzzy here, joe: this right?)

In-reply-to: your message of Tue, 29 May 90 13:12:02 PDT

I thought you had taken Carl's suggestion.
1) Do a one-pack ASP save of BPA1 (unit 301) to tape.
2) Arrange it so that a different, ZFORMATted HDA responds as unit 301.
3) Restore the one-tape save.
The system must not be rebooted during this process.
