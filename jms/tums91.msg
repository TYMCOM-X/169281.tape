Subject: GETTAB value for TYMCOM-X monitor type. 

When Osman and I talked to Jim Flemming, he said that he had just added type
5 to UUOSYM.  Based on the date of this MCO, it was just 30 minutes before
I called.

Subject: SWITCH.INI package 

Please see (SPL:930)SWITCH.REQ, .SAI, .REL for a "small" sail routine
which reads switch.ini in most [sic "all"] it's glory.  It handles
continuation lines ok, but I believe comments in SWITCH.INI may not
work they way DEC expects.

It takes 3 arguments... Name, Option, PPNFlag.  It looks for a line
which starts:
  NAME     or
  NAME:OPTION   (if option is non-null)

and returns the line (or lines) as a single string, continuation lines
concatenated together minus the " -" at the end of the line(s).

See (SPL)WHEN for an example of it's usage. PPNFlag is true if you want
to read from the GFD'd ppn, otherwise it reads from your AUN (I think,
read the code to be sure).  It's a well-behaved program as far as
channels and break-table variables go... sigh.

I'd have done that on a system where they're storred in the clear.  As

connected to an LSI-11 base and go in and load the KMC somehow.  I
think there's a program like KMCLOD in <WRS> that you just run.  You'd

Subject: Re: Patch to avoid losing characters. 
In-reply-to: your message of Wed, 11 Dec 85 12:41:12 PST

I can produce on demand (using an internal circuit) gross and frequent
character lossage over a circuit:
  1. log in to host with new base
  2. build an internal circuit (to same host) with taux, auxio, mhx or anything
  3. do a DIR (SYS)/EVE or something to generate output
  4. wait - you'll see lots of garbage after a few hundred chars
I've been talking to Carl about it.  I'm convinced it happens on non-internal
circuits, although less frequently because of very poor (2*9.6KB) connect-
ivity of new bases to eachother.  I see 3-4 instances per week in the TUMS
log file.  I'm also convinced its a backpressure protocol problem.  The base
is not implementing a flow quota:
  * Never send more than XXX characters to a given port without completely
    emptying the host output ring in order to insure that no backpressure
    message has been sent.
The value for XXX is 32 (should be 30 or 34) for the ten.  I don't know what
it should be for the base, but it should essentially be the amount of buffer
space guarenteed to be available for a port after backpressure has been sent.
32 is a good guess, but it should be checked by looking at PDP-10 or Varian
code.  -Bill

I just talked to Dave Smith and he showed me a trace of base/host traffic
where the 10 is appearently not honoring the quota rule I mentioned in
the previous memo.  The code is clearly there, so it might not be working.
-Bill

It still seems that the base does not have the ability to honor the quota
since it doesn't buffer and the dispatcher doesn't honor quotas.  ???

Subject: Obscure INFO command 

Since we're playing with trees and our own names of things I though
you'd be interested in this.

The BUILD command takes as argument, a pointer to the info tree.
If the master file INFO.DAT already exists (even if empty) then
it will be built in your own directory.  If the master file does
NOT exist, then INFO.DAT will be written to the master directory
(INFO).  So, to create your own INFO tree...

1)  Create INFO.DAT empty.
2)  Create your info tree file X.Y with main menu Z.
3)  Run INFO
4)  enter "BUILD X.Y:Z"
5)  watch it build.

Your main menu does not need to be called "ROOT".  If no arguments
are supplied the program uses "INFO.NFO:ROOT".

I plan to change this slightly in preparation for the tree selection
code which will allow multiple trees.  Probably some sort of search
for .DAT files and reading the first lines... anyway, when this is
done the name of the tree X.Y will cause it to look for X.DAT instead
of INFO.DAT as it does now.

COMMOD.MAC has already been changed to reflect these new entries.
     I re-used some of the SWAP pointers, HOMK4S > HOMSPS, HOMSWP > HOMFEF
     and UNISWP > UNIFEP.

REFSTR, UUOCON and KSFEFS still need to be modified.
KSBLOD has already been modified to use BOOT pages 3,4,5 as all other
processors already do.

  Ken, receive my apologies for answering so late to your December memo.
 
  1.  Oper names  for host 930 to  access INFO database: copying  930 INFO
      database to system 90  will not work. System 90 is  due to be defin-
      itively taken out of the network way before the end of 1986
 
      System 74 (accounting host) might be a better choice
 
      We need essentially EVERYTHING that exists in the INFO database
 
      Removing RF from 930  does not seem practical: as far  as I can tell
      this is used both to access INFO database and to access monitor code
      when weing for a replacement
 
  2.  Accessing on host 74 the Validation database: we will be using user-
      name CTOPSMGR and oper names JAY or STRATMAN (the latter to be vali-
      dated)
 
      Files accessed are: USERDB.DMS, CUSTDB.DMS, ADDRDB.DMS
 
  3.  Current status  of the  project: we  are running  January accounting
      cycle with your and our data in  parallel. We will let you know when
      we do not need your data any more
 
      We can  give you a royalty  report containing connect,  tru (without
      pru), pru (as a separate amount) for prime, nonprime and batch time.
 
      Please provide  a list  of royalty codes  as viewed  by MIS  and the
      relationship between each royalty code and the corresponding code in
      the TYMCOM/370  raw accounting. After reviewing the TYMCOM-370 moni-
      tor notes,  it seems that the  corresponding TYMCOM-370 code  can be
      one of the following raw accounting fields:
 
          Accounting record type 5, field  "PREMPGNM" for the royalty code
          and field "PREMPRU" for the pru amount
 
          Accounting record type 9, field "TRNSPGNM" and field "TRNSCHGS"
 
      Please indicate what kind of record layout you need for your royalty
      data
 
  I hope this answers your questions.
 
    Regards,
    Eric
 
  PS: special note  for Patrice de Beranger: the royalty  report will have
  to be  taken from your  data and sent  to Ken  BeDell. Since we  (YM and
  myself) provide you with detailed data you  are the only one in position
  to provide this report, since you do the totaling

Ken,

      Eric referred to two items to which I can (should?) provide answers:

1.)  PERP replacement:  the project is our number two priority, and should be
completed within about one month (my rough estimate--I'm not directly
involved in it at this time).  We are confident that this is poenty of time
prior to the date expiration of the 940s.

2.)  OPER license access on 930:  Eric's point about the plans to take system
90 out of the network well before the end of the year is news to me, and is a
very valid point.  Their need to access monitor code on 930 will be taken
under advisement.  No answer to this problem immediately, but soon.

      Dennis

The version of PCOM on 70 is old and doesn't implement license
passing.  Until a new version of PCOM is transmitted to 70, I
have redeclared MERLIN so you shouldn't need any license.  This
is only a temporary fix because next transmittal of MERLIN will
cause the protection to revert.  Hopefully, it will hold out
until the new PCOM arrives on 70.  Let me know if it doesn't work.
[Carl: has the latest PCOM been transmitted?]

About uploading files from a Rainbow...I'm not a rainbow user,
but I use TYMCOMM which has built in file transfer.  If you just
want to send a text file, it is probably best to use the BIONIC
program on the 10.

	-r bionic
	*run
	INPUT FILE NAME: foo
	READY FOR INPUT
	(send file here, then wait 20 sec
	1 RECORDS INPUT
	EXIT
	-

The file won't be echoed, it will be recorded faithfully in the file
you specified.  There is no EOF character, it just waits for 20
seconds without data (so you can use all 128 characters).  It uses
block input and should be faster than anything else (including TUMS).

Still, there is yet a better way - KERMIT.  I don't know if there is
a KERMIT running on the 10 though.  [Carl: what do you use on your
Rainbow for file transfer?]

Subject: BAD SYSUFD PATCH 

Correction:  The patch to turn off the weird SYS:.UFD = (UFD).UFD does
what we expected... however, we didn't expect that some old accounting
programs actually used that "feature"/"bug" and thus, we cannot patch
it at the moment.

   I went around to most of the Dallas machines with the new /P-8 monitors
and in an effort to just "get it done before I forgot again" I put the
instructiuon  "CAME T1,MFDPPN" back where it was patched out of both the
running /P-8 monitors and (SYS)NEWMON on
  27, 31, 37, 56 and 65.   Just fixed (SYS)NEWMON on 25, 72 and 79.

DID NOT FIX systems 23 and 54 since they were unavailable for some reason
at this time.  Someone (OSMAN,JOE) please check them and un-do the SYSUFD
patch:

Subject: (TYMNET)NODES.MAP updated for 14-bit node numbers. 

NODES.MAP is now 96 pages long - it has a 3-word entry for all 16834 possible
14-bit node numbers.  All nodes that do not have an explicit name now have
a 9-character implicit name.  The implicit name consists of a space, a hyphen,
the 5-digit node number (from 00000 to 37777), another hyphen, and another
space.  The program (TYMNET)DEFNOD does not list implicit names so that
it is easier to see the defined node names.

Now that the fully expanded NODES.MAP has been telecopied to all systems,
SYSTAT won't get into a loop anymore.  SYSTAT currently does not even attempt
to look for the name of any mode above 7777, which is OK since the base passes
only 12 bits to SCNSER (for LDBLOG).

Try running SYSTAT (with license set) on a "real" system to see the new names.

Subject: TELECOPY thinks 62 is a 370 

I've "patched" the table in TELECO.SAV which knows what type of hosts
each system is.  (Dennis, I want to change this, so come and see me
when you come back to work).  This patch is on SYS on systems 930, 62,
36, 35 and 39.  With the patch, TELECO should now work OK since it
now thinks it's a TYMCOM-X system.  I may patch it on all systems if
I get the chance... will let you all know.  If anyone needs it before
then... send me mail & I'll patch it there.  I believe that we're about
to release an updated TELECO.SAV to add 62...  sigh.
/Carl

PS: IF it's version 22.3, absolute locations in the .SAV file mentioned
    here, 3115/ 3,,27005 (system 60) 3116/ 4,,27014 (system 61) and
    3117/ 4,,27014 and can be changed to 3,,27005 (system 62)... sigh!

TELECOPY needs to be modified so that it understands SUP error 7.  It should
say "ACCESS BARRED - GROUP FOR USERNAME DOES NOT INCLUDE DESTINATION HOST".

Subject: Maze of twisty passages 

Following the code for USETI and IN chanios, just starting in IOCSS at
the dispatch table, winding it's way to FILUUO's DSKDSP table, not always
the same index, possibly recursive, bouncing through SIMIO, IOCSS, FILUUO
and MAPIO is enough to give someone a case of claustrophobia... even a
headache...

Anyway, it appears the UUOs probably work fine in their present form.  So,
someplace after the data has been placed in the LMA chains and it get's
"pulled" into memory by FILIO or some other entity, a register must be
getting clobberred... maybe even while in the UUO and it's waiting for a
response back from the actual I/O stuff.  Anyway, I followed the UUO part
without finding anything where it "could" go wrong.

U is setup from DEVSUP which contains 0 (if a STR) or the UDB (if a unit).
I'm not clobbering U in the UUO.  STRPPU is used both as a divisor and as
a multiplier to find the right unit or check the highest page on the STR.
UNIPPU is checked if mapping a range of pages (which DSKCLN is not!).  I'm
calling it quits for tonight, will look for a register getting clobbered
in FILIO, PCBIO or SWAMP in the morning...

Things followed out, DSKCHR uuo works [FILUUO], CLOCK1 watchdog on disk
space should be OK (or we'd crash once a minute?). I haven't tried the new
SYSSTR UUO but will before I log off.... from what you saw, any ideas?

Apparently, EXEC is doing CHANIO ac,P1  (in SIMIOM code), user had done
a .CHIN CHANIO  (monitor was doing a .CHSMP) ... and it was waiting ...
The monitor got into FILIO... I need to see the crash PDL. Sigh!

SUBJ:  Field Service Company's Network Access: This Building. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      I've received a phone call from Tymnet:  FSC's access to Tymnet in this
building, both for terminals and for our hosts, is not 'legal'.  I.e., Payment
Systems Co.  pays for the engines in this building and for the synchronous
network line to connect to the public network.  Pmnt. Sys. Co.  is billed by
Tymnet for this service.  We do not pay for it at all.  I am told, by Tymnet,
that our traffic "degrades Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s service", and that our use of
service purchased by another company is not allowed.

      I have discussed this with Pat Diamond, and he has agreed to handle the
solution of this problem.  He and I discussed some alternatives, and the
suggestion which he said he will persue most strongly includes:  the
installation on site here (as a 'lab' machine--self installed) of a Tymnet
Engine that FSC owns; and upgrading the line(s) (from here to Solar Way) which
Pmnt. Sys. Co.  'owns', from 9.6 Kbps to 14.4 Kbps.

      Our lab machine would be the pass-through connection for our micro-
Tym-Bases and would provide any terminal connections we might need to take off
Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engines.  The only traffic that Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engine
will have may be pass-through traffic.  We could share costs for the lines
with Pmnt. Sys. Co., connecting one line to their machine and the other to
our machine.  Pat tells me that this would probably provide service MUCH more
quickly than ordering new phone service from Pac. Tel., and--if Sal Spinelli
of Pmnt. Sys. Co. agrees--be less expensive.

      Pat tells me that he will contact Sal next week:  Sal is in Irvine this
week, but next week will be available at Tymnet, Orchard Parkway.  He will be
in meetings there next week about their network access problems, but be able
to be reached by the Tymnet operator.

Subject: Network access change: Liberty. 

      Discussion of this pending change with Joe Smith has shown this to be an
opportunity:  if we get the lab node, we could have an ISIS machine which
would allow an Async Host Interface TYMCOM slot, as well as a Async Terminal
Interface CONSAT slot.  The Host Interface slot could allow us to bring the
the 2020 (host 95) into the network quickly, plus we could put the consoles
for the hosts on them -- allowing us to use the consoles remotely (through
network sub-addressing).

      Another alternative could be connecting to the Albrae St.  location.
This could provide redundancy, if this were in addition to the lines discussed
previously.  If we order any lines, I believe ordering directly from Pac.
Tel. will will be significantly less expensive than ordering from Tymnet.
Tymnet's monthly charge for service between here and Solar Way:  Tymnet's
monthly charge would be over $700 -- the advantage they offer is Tymnet
Network Control's reporting of and follow up on the line outage.

      Pat suggested another cost-saving alternative for redundancy from our
engine to the network:  a dial-up Network sync line, rather than a 4-wire
dedicated line.

Subject: Using the GATEWAY command in TELECOPY. 

To TELECOPY files to or from system 39, you have to start on a PDP-10 on the
public net, build a gateway to BUBBNET, then copy the files.  The host numbers
of the gateways are: 5946, 1461, 1579, 5516, 5981, 1552, 2866, 3171, and 7255.
For example:

	.R TELECOPY
	: GATEWAY 7255;JMS:39
	Password <password for JMS on BUBBNET>
	: (*6NEWS:39)TELECO.DOC,(JMS:930)		;Pull a file from 39
	: (JMS:930)SWITCH.INI,:39			;Push a file to 39
	: QUIT

The gateway host numbers are listed in (*6NEWS)BUBNET.DOC on most PDP-10 systems.

Subject: 3650 disk project. 

Remaining items in the 3650 project:                    17-Mar-86

1) Verify that APT10 works.  It is designed to transfer files between the
   TYMCOM-X system and KLDCP DECtapes via the CTY.  Use it to put SA10NW on
   a DECtape.   This requires a standalone KL, brought up in CONSOLE mode.

2) Determine why the paper-tape version of BOTLOD does not work like the version
   in MONBTS.  This requires a standalone KI with 3650 disks for complete veri-
   fication, although most of the work could be done on C24 with Ampex disks.

3) After the KI version of BOTLOD works, put the KL version on the DECtapes
   using APT10.  This can be done during a scheduled downtime.

4) Determine where PAKCP5 fails when writing the secondary HOM and BAT pages.
   This is the only thing keeping the COPY command from working.  This requires
   standalone time on the CPU with 3650 disks, not more than one weekend.

5) Make a single version of PAKCOPY that understands 3675 in blocks and pages.
   This means that the size of the areas used for channel command lists need to
   be determined at run time, not as an assembly option.  This can be done on
   C24 with Ampex disks.

6) Locate the routines in the monitor that assume that all units of a structure
   are the same size.  Determine whether it is feasible to have a DSKB composed
   of a mixture of packs formatted in blocks and in pages.

7) Modify BOOTS to understand all 4 disk types.  Right now, "BOOTS" understands
   3675 blocks only, and "BOOTX" understands 3650 pages only.  This requires
   standalone time on C24 with Ampex disks, and can be verified on C26
   during a scheduled reload of the system.

8) Add a command to BOOTS telling it which set of packs to look at.  This is so
   that a one-pack test system can be kept spinning and not confuse the Monitor
   by having two packs claiming to be "DSKB0".  This will have a side effect of
   making BOOTS much faster in loading the monitor, and can be done on 930.

9) Install 2nd upgraded SA10 for continued testing on C24.

10) Add code to PAKCP5 that can rewrite HA/R0 on 3650.  I have disassembled the
   relevant portions of SA10NW.SAV, and will put them in PAKCOP.MAC.  Testing
   requires days of standalone time on C24 with new SA10 and 3650 disks.

11) Merge PAKCP5 with the pages version of 3675 PAKCOP.

12) Determine whether bad blocks really work.  Verify that PAKCOPY assigns
    alternate tracks correctly.  Make it look at the BAT block that SA10NW
    creates.  Make the monitor add new entries when it discovers bad pages.

Have I told you about the large computer now installed and running at
Stacken, the computer club at the KTH (the Royal Institute of
Technology) in Stockholm? No? Well, then...

A few years ago, DEC (Digital Equipment Corp) in Sweden had a sort of
"white elephant" on their hands, a DECsystem-10 (the same type you are
running COM on), but a very old model with a KA10 CPU, single
transistor logic boards and good old core memory. Big as hell, lots of
blinkenlights, and with an appetite for kiloAmpere that would ruin any
computer hobbyist. The customer that had leased the thing did not want
it any more, and DEC did not even try to find another. But instead of
scrapping it, they gave it to us in Stacken. Sure, we could take care
of it, and even payed the transport (about 3000 SEK). But where would
we house such a beast? Fortunately, KTH promised us a place to run it.
For two years it was kept in a garage at KTH while we lobbyed the KTH
administration to give us that place. (There is a constant shortage of
space at KTH, alas). It was not after a new guy in Stacken, Peter
Lothberg, had renewed the efforts by pestering the Principal himself
for a while that we finally got the promised room to install it in.

Then around last spring (1985) the work started. During the summer of
1985 the place was refitted with a real raised computer room floor,
electrical power, terminal lines, a cooling machine with outdoor
condensors, and everything else needed to make the place a
full-fledged computer center.

Meanwhile, our DEC-10, now named "KATIA" (a pun on "Nadja" which is
the DEC-2020 at KTH and "KA-TIA", where "tia" is 10:er in swedish),
was temporary installed and tested at CCCC (Colossal Cave Computer
Center), Peter:s playroom where he already has a DECsystem-10 going.
That DEC-10, (named KICKI) was used for testing and debuggning Katia.
Without it, it might still be nonfunctional.

When the room was finished, Katia was moved in and re-debugged. (You
don't move such a beast without dislocating at least a few wires). And
then, one night last autumn, the champagne bottle, which had been
bought for just this reason, was opened. Katia was installed, and up
and running! According to the tradition, which begun with the
installing of Kicki a year eariler, the bottle is uncorked when you
can give the command MAKE LOVE on the console, which makes a file
named "LOVE" with the venerable TECO editor, and get the resonse "NOT
WAR?" on the console. (This is a "hack" in TECO, installed for obvious
reasons long ago, probably way back in the sixties).

Then on the 23rd of October 1985 Katia was officially inaugurated as
Stacken was throwing its first Big Party in its 7-year history, where
participants could awe at the extremely rare sight of over 100
computer hobbyists, nerds and hackers in (get this!) ties and jackets
(some of them even pinstriped!) The members and a large number of
specially invited dignitaries met at a splendid Dinner With Everything
at the KTH student corps house. Speeches were held, glasses were
raised, jokes were cracked and the atmosphere was high. After the
coffee everyone walked over to the room where Katia stood happily
humming since a few days, where the Principal inaugurated Katia by
cutting a punched tape spanned across the door.

Such a project can't be done without two things: many highly skilled
enthusiasts and a lot of money. Fortunately, Stacken had both. The
latter came from selling copies of our EMACS workalike editor "AMIS"
for about 500 USD a copy to other installations of DEC-10s, VAXen,
PR1MEs and Norsk Data. AMIS was our first success back in 1980, when
me and six others got fed up with not having a really good editor.
(I'm using it right now for writing this text). So AMIS, aside from
preventing us from going berserk, gave us the means to install Katia.

By the way, we can use more hardware. All sorts of donations are
appreciated. Especially disks, but we'll take anything that could
possibly be connected to a DECsystem-10. Also terminals, cooling
machines... anything. Send inquiries to me, or better still, to:
Datorforeningen Stacken, c/o NADA, KTH, S-10044 Stockholm, SWEDEN.

Katia is a neat hobby computer. Those kids and their daddys with
CBM-64:s can go suck on a BASIC manual. The DEC-10 is a REAL COMPUTER,
36 bit words, real tape, disks, DECtapes and a glorious collection of
blinking lights. It runs the TOPS-10 timesharing operating system, one
of the finest and most user-friendly OS ever made (it beats both VMS
and UNIX singlehandedly), rivalled only by TOPS-20. And the awesome
sight of Katia:s 12 large blue cabinets with the blinking lights, its
designed front panel and the rest of the hardware filling the room
stirs the heart. Katia looks like a computer should! This machine and
its worshippers are not unlike the phenomenon of people lovingly
restoring old steam engines and cars. But while Katia definitely is a
veteran computer, it's still modern. It outperforms a medium-sized VAX
and has a much neater instruction set. (Long live the DECsystem-10
designers!) And there are gigabytes upon gigabytes with highly
sophisticated software which we can run on it. Our only problem so far
is what to do with all those unused CPU cycles.

Anyone wants a million prime numbers?

This is in answer to Roe's question of how to write a tape on the DEC-10 to
be turned into microfiche (such as the full-save listings).

Subject: LOGON and SWITCH.INI 

It is "nice" that LOGON will let you select options based on node-port
or simply node.  TYMNET nodes on the otherhand do NOT, (I repeat, do NOT)_,
report the physical port number anymore.  Not just the micro-nodes... all
TYMNET nodes are that way...  so, physical port number is meaningless in
99.9 percent of the cases.  (On a micronode,connected to a host, it has a
little meaning, by co-incidence).  The port reported is more likely the
circuit number reported to ISIS (or it's look-alikes).

So,  please don't feel that you are having problems with LOGON if you
cannot get it to select on a specific port.  TYMNET isn't really reporting
the physical port to the host anymore.  The Node information IS correct if
you are coming from a real node, and sometimes is a lie for internal circuits
on a micro-node host.  All "real" circuits, are supposed to be correct.

Sigh!

Symptom:  SPOOL not running, SPLFIX gets a fatal error on file SPOOL.GBK
        Renaming files, wait...
        LOOKUP failed for (SPOOL)SPOOL.GBK.
        Fatal error.

        Please call the TYMCOM-X Support Line : (408) 446-6709

Diagnosis: SPLFIX had created SPOOL.GNW, SPOOL.FNW, and SPOOL.MNW.  The files
        SPOOL.MBK and SPOOL.FBK were dated 28-Feb-86 but SPOOL.GBK did not

        this BAK file just so it could delete it.

Cure:   "COPY SPOOL.GDF,SPOOL.GBK", "RUN (UTIL)SPLFIX".  Done.

Note:   Carl and I both agree that this is not really a hotline problem.
        Maybe we need another policy for this kind of support on weekends.
        Anyway, SPLFIX needs to be changed so that it does not use the old phone

Subject: CONSAT/TYMCOM class. 

I am in the TTE 235 class until Friday.  I cam across some interesting info.

SUB HOST ADDRESSING - Allows a user to connect to a particular line or set of
lines on a TYMCOM (async host interface).  Selection is based on two 
characters in the username.  For instance, "TRAINING78", "TRAINING75", and
"TRAININGKL" would allow connection to the 780 host, the 750 host, or the
KL host.

PORT ADDRESSING - Allows a host (or user) to connect to a particular line
on a CONSAT (async terminal interface).  Selection is based on digits after
a period in the host number.  For instance, "JMS:931.19" and "JMS:123.1".
Each addressable line can have many HOST.NUMBER combinations assigned to it.
Any host can seize an addressable port as long as no one else is using it.
These lines can also be used to log in from.

Addressing features must be enabled on a line by line basis in the TYM file.

{sigh} Yes, this is exactly what I've been talking about for our CONSAT to
put in each data center so that we may login to the KLINIK lines on our KLs.

JMS:DALLAS.27  or JMS:984.27  etc. ... it would be nice if they could be
username:KLINIK.27  or  :KLINIKC.33  :KLINIKF.28  :KLINIKD.25 ???

I've been calling this subhost addressing, similar to :TYMNET/930.4  where
the .4 probably doesn't work... Dennis can give us port numbers on a uNode
if we can give him a host number to assign to it...  eg. :118.4 to use on
a printer port or some such.

I prefer this to KLINIK57 as the usrname....

We can't use :DALLAS since host numbers are numeric only.  If the CONSAT in
Dallas was host 1234, then we could define a username KLINIKD with a home of
1234.  To get to 25's CTY, we would have to use KLINIKD:.25;KLNIKD-PASSWORD
or JMS:1234.25;JMS-PASSWORD.

Addressable ports are not supported on solo TYMSATs like 3143 and 3146; they
need an ISIS CONSAT.  We could experiment with them by connecting the 2020 to
the micro Engine.  All we need is permission to use node 4605 and get another
host number assigned to it (it currently has kernel host 4079 and accounting
host 18927).  There is an option in the TYM file that will suppress node
generated text messages, such as "please log in:" and "see your rep...", the
documentation is not clear as to whether this affects messages like "error,
type password" and "host down".

It sounds like we should get Validations to assign us 5 more host numbers for
use at Liberty Street.

Subject: Job Queue - License bits 

We need to maintain some level of control over what entities (persons and
programs) can manipulate the job queue data.  We have at our disposal one
free bit in the privilege word, 3 free bits in the "real" license word and
(I think) 9 or 10 free bits of "pseudo" license.

I propose that we use one of the 3 bits in the license word to allow users
and programs to perform certain "privileged" queue functions, such as insert
delete and setting system-level priorities.  I also think that OP license
may be enough to allow operations to run some programs, but that operators
in general should not have this Queue-Manipulation (QM) license.  Instead a
pseudo license Queue-Administrator (QA) ought to be given them which would
require a TATTLE record to be written with their OPERNAME whenever they need
to change something and programs having QM license would check QA license
before they allow users/processes to do things.

**** Defacto **** Temporarily, in lieu of discussion, I've defined LC.QM as
1B11 (1B29 for frame) for this purpose.  Nothing {SETOP,OPER,MONITOR,etc.}
knows about it (yet), but it's there in the programs being written today.

Comments?  Aspersions?  Complaints?

JL license might be reasonable since one having JL license could write their
own PERP to do whatever they want.  One reason to have a new license for the
PERP replacement would be to be able to give it to people you didn't want to
give JL to.  However, since much of the power infered by JL is manifest in an
indirect manner in the queue file, manipulating it is tantamount to JL.  I
also doubt that you'd want to give this new license to anyone who doesn't
already have JL, anyway.  I suppose that manipulating the queue does not give
one indirectly or otherwise the ability to create frames logged in to any
arbitrary PPN as JL does -- in that sense it is considerably less powerful.
If the new PERP validates Usernames/PPN's in the queue file against the LUD
as I have assumed in my last statement, then this would be an argument for
making the new license, and considering it less powerful than JL.

I completely and emphatically agree that the license to directly manipulate
the queue, QM or JL or whatever, be held only by development/systems people.
The kind of access required by operations should be allowed through a program
which holds QM/JL and performs the limited and audited functions on behalf of
an operator validated by OP or some such license.  Being set on the frame may
be enough since the audit trail to the operator name does exist in the stream.

Well, that's the sum total of my babble on the subject.  How's it going?
Need a beta test site?  We have no PERP at all so a flakey one would be
welcome!  I'd even be willing to insert stuff in the queue by hand if
necessary until things solidify.

I'm not sure of the actual extent of the problem, but our group, the PDP-10
operating systems group, has spent some time pinpointing some problem areas
which need some work.  In particular, the node/base and host crashes caused
when the dispatcher gets sick for any reason.  We would like to at least
discuss our concerns before you release the new E-Bus base code to the rest
of the world.

If this is the schedule for an interim release while the remainder of our
concerns are worked into a later version of the code, that will be agreeable.
However, we would like to coordinate the release of the E-Bus code with our
own operating system releases scheduled for the PDP-10s in the next two
months.

Subject: INTADR stuff. 

The idea of expanding the 70-word INTADR block can be done, I have located all
the places that need to be changed to allow this.  Unfortunately, the following
interrupt causes can not take direct advantage of the extra room in the block:
	(4) Timer trap
	(6) WAKE uuo
	(13) Notice to quit
	(14) Exit in child frame
	(16) TRU limit exceeded
	(0-2,4-12)  All port initiated interrupts except for 3=no room for UUO
These interrupts are detected while not in the job's context and cannot access
user address space.

This is an argument for having a nonswappable process data block, which is
allocated when the frame is assigned, resides in exec virtual address space,
and is pointed to by a new JBT table.

Joe,
  is it possible to return in our 35 word block, the "cause" of the interrupt
on a given channel, and not overwrite it when a second interrupt occurs on
the same channel, i.e. force the event to "block"?, so that if we have 2 or 3
causes assigned to the same channnel, we can distinguish the cause, and the
next cause will interrupt us again, etc...

  or does this just get us back to the "we only have one bit" scenerio... i
think it does, so this is again, all for naught... sigh.

Subject: Bug in F3 microcode. 

I was checking the instructions that DEC defined after the KI was built to see
if the F3 executed these new opcodes the same as the KL and KS.  I haven't gone
thru the entire list, because I was rudely halted in the double-integer codes.

DADD = opcode 114 = add pair of ACs to pair of memory locations and store the
		    71-bit integer result in the two ACs. 
This works on the F3.

DSUB = opcode 115 = subtract pair of memory locations from pair of ACs and
		    store the 71-bit integer result in the two ACs.
This works on F3.

DMUL = opcode 116 = multiply pair of memory locations by pair of ACs and store
		    the quad-word result in four ACs.
Unimplemented on F3 - traps to INSSIM which goes to ILLINS.

DDIV = opcode 117 = divide quad-word number in four ACs by pair of memory
		    locations.  Put quotient in two ACs, reminder in two ACs.
This halts the F3 microcode.

The F3 is halted very dead by opcode 117.  The MI STOP light was on, as were
MI PAR ERROR and MEM PAR ERROR.  (I have hardcopy showing which lights were on
and what instruction I used.)

Since I was not sure that the microcode could be successfully restarted, so
I reloaded the microcode and reloaded 930.  I am sure the same would happen
on 62, where an unprivileged user running DDT can halt the system.

Hmmm, very nice.  Not just halt the system, but HALT the system!
I suppose it would be quite simple to no-op the instruction if
one could find how to run the uCode assembler.  -Bill

Subject: Node 6760 

Joe, 
  The problem you had with 6760 could be a loading problem.  The bootstrap
promes in 6760 may not handle the longer possible timeout of loadii.  The
sucessful running of the (CURR11) version doesn't mean that the load
of the (NEW11)version went correctly.  Try it again.  If the same thing happens,
halt 6760.  If the halt address (typed out with a @) is around 1246 or 157700,
then 6760 is still in the bootstrap.  It would have timed out at the very end
of the load.  Try the load again.  If you want to eliminate timeouts, turn
of the "LTC" switch before depressing restart. (on some of your boxes LTC is
labeled "AUX").  Don't forget to turn it back on after loading is complete,
because the micronode doesn't run very well without an accurate clock.

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible
         for informing their clients of significant service
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer"
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls
         regarding network or operational problems will be
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and
         manuals which describe the use of processing services.

    o    Maintenance of mailing lists of commercial clients.


    o    Publishing of MDIPC Service Descriptions.

    o    Vendor manual's purchasing and distribution, e.g. IBM,
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number
         is available for batch job status inquiries and priority
         asssitance.

    o    1-800-MDC-HELP (1-800-632-4357) or 1-314-232-6943, in
         Missouri are numbers that may be called when you do not
         know who to call.  You will be connected with an
         appropriate MDIPC area to resolve any processing
         problems.

    Any changes in contact points for MDIPC services will be
    coordinated in advance with the appropriate ISG Business
    Units.

Subject: Access Date bug 

It appears impossible to create, supercede, update or rename a file such
that it has any access date other than the one it had, or todays.  This
is a bug.  The YAMM says you can always set it to a date in the past.  I
want to create files with ancient creation dates so I can tell when they've
been accessed.  -Bill

Subject: Access date vs Creation date 

It appears you've got your wires crossed, (or your eyes).  Creation dates
CAN be set to the past without any problems.  Access dates say create and
supersede must be 0 or in the future; update and rename are not clear as
to how they work with non-zero dates... and I thought that that worked if
rename is used.  If it doesn't then, I don't know that it should allow a
person to set access dates to the past.. since the rename is an access and
should update the access date to the present!

/Carl

Ancient creation dates work fine... I guess update & rename only allow the
original or the present access date, so ancient access dates are illegal.
I understand what you want to do, so I sympathize.

Ooops, I did say "creation" when I meant "access" in my last sentence.
At any rate, the YAMM says that Create/Supercede can set only current or
future (but why?) and update/Rename can set only current or past.  One
would have to close with option '10 to preserve a date in the past.  At
any rate, I can't set anything but what it was or current using any
combination of lookup/enter/rename.  TITO would want to set it to the
past, as well as other archive like programs.  I am sure it used to
work, but it probably got broken when Ernie added the fast disk clean
stuff.  -Bill

The above events show that something went wrong in 930's base, and sent a

not have a chance to respond to the zap when the login request came in.  It
output the TTYZNE (Zapper Not Echoed) message and continued.  Then 6657 noticed
the problem, output its BFC message, reset itself, and waited for 930 to resync.
After 90 seconds of no activity in the IRING, 930 output the NOBASE message to
the CTY, which says "No response from base.  Please reload it.  PDP-10 is OK."
930 then reset IRPPDP, ORPPDP, IRP620, ORP620, and went thru its resync code.
This succeeded, producting the message BASEOK.

Subject: System 62 - Events 

During an attempt to do the all-files on 62, we kept losing vacuum on
the tape drive.  Steve Capik was called but has not yet arrived to date.

Last night, we decided to try the Kennedy 9400 drive that Dan & Eric
had sitting on the cart to see if it really was compatible and whether
the F3 could handle it.  Apparently, under timesharing, the 9400 works
just fine at 1600 or 6250 bpi.

Due to lack of an available working 9100 drive, we decided to see how much
tape an all-files took at 6250 and started the all-files.  It completed
this afternoon, and with the exception of one tape (accidently) written at
1600 bpi, the save took 6.5 tapes.  (5.5 @ 6250, 1 @ 1600).

I believe that the all-files takes less time as well, but we didn't really
perform any accurate timing tests.

/Carl

PS... it would be nice to be able to use a 9400 on one of our systems for
      all of the backups.....

Subject: SCREAM/STREAM 

I've updated (MPL)STREAM.SAI to work with larger node files.  I reloaded
SCREAM to make use of this and then telecopied it to all systems.  I hope
there is a more formal procedure, but I figured nobody could care since
the old version is useless (unless you delete (TYMNET)NODES.MAP).  -Bill

Subject: New CALLI -151 : FINASS 

We've implemented a new uuo, Frame INteruppt ASSignment to allow one to
assign an interrupt cause to another frame.  Primary usage will be to
trap EXIT/LOGOUT in child frame on a frame by frame basis (instead of
.IAFEX, exit in any child).  We will later have .FOCSI : cause software
interrupt in frame with causes .IASIP (software interrupt from parent),
.IASIC (child), .IASIS (sibling), .IASIA (any frame)...

Anyway, I'd like to use this stuff in SAIL and at the moment I don't want
to have to release a new version of SAIL... (at least not yet)...

Do you know if there are *ANY* sail programs using INTDEV(DEV,CAUSE,CHAN)
which executes the INTRMT uuo to assign the interrupt channel.

Documentation says that this is only good for the ACT: device and I suspect
that only CHKPNT.MAC uses this uuo.  Does that sound realistic?  ...or are
there old programs lying around (in sail, or other languages) to attempt to
use the INTRMT uuo?

Do you know of any SAIL programs using INTRMT directly?

--------------

On system 62 in the meantime, I've "patched" SAIL.LOW and SAISGA.SHR to
use "FINASS 1," (calli -151) in the one place that had "INTRMT 1," (calli -52)
in the code.

I will propagate this change throughout the world if you can't come up
with any objections...

Subject: Consulting for the St. Louis KLs. 

Mary Meyers called me from the St. Louis datacenter with a question on how
to use BACKUP to restore files.  The person who wrote the tape did not give
her enough information.  As a result, this question took up 2 hours of my
time, preventing me from working on the TYMCOM-X monitor.

Do we have a written agreement covering this situation yet?  Is FSC going to
be re-imbursed for two hours of hand-holding?  I don't mind doing consulting
as long as its covered by a contract.

The only use of INTRMT anywhere that I know of is CHKPNT.  I don't understand
why you need to patch SAIL, why not just add a new runtime for the new type
in a library that gets required?  Doesn't it just return a channel number?

Subject: Micronode 2346 

Yesterday, I took an LSI-11/03-SE box and a BA11-ME box from the 2020 rack
and substituted the DUV-11 and DRV-11 cards from 2346 into it.  It is now
in the network as node 2346 and has been up for 20+ hours so far.  The old
LSI-11/03-LJ box is sitting on the table in the lab.

The new 2346 has the processor and memory boards that were in the box in
the 2020 rack... so, we have verified that it is not any of the communications
boards rthat were causing the problems.  We have not eliminated either the
11/03-LJ box itself (power supply etc) or the cpu and memory boards that
were in the old box.  We can worry about that later.... for now we have a
working network.

Subject: 2020 Progress (Cough) 

Some progress has been made in getting the 2020 up and running...
however, not enough...

1) By swapping the RH11's we can boot from magtape on UBA1/RH=776700
2) We have a KS1LOD.DMP file which uses UBA1 and the first RH.
3) We can load in the monitor.

after swapping the RH11s back to their original positions, we can start
to bring the system up... however, we get a PAGEME (using KSXN13) or an IME
stopcode.  IME in FILIO @ ERRRCV+12/LDB T2,PGYPNO  just after LDB PG,UNYPAC.
THis is the normal case.  If I load DDT and try to single step, or put in a
breakpoint at ERRRCV+anything it prints $n>> and then falls into the infinate
loop printing the "Manual restart from 147" message without printing any of
the stopcode info.

  All of this happens just when I try to enter FILES... I haven't gotten far
enough to even try to refresh the disks.

  The above error got me thinking maybe one of the drives/packs has a problem
so I moved the plugs around and tried a single pack (the one that had gotten
the home page inconsistancy errors) and the stopcode PCBIO(FINPCB+13) started
occurring.  At this point, I'm stopping for the evening.

Joe: If you have any ideas... let me know via MAIL, or call in the afternoon.

  And another thing... we only have 448K of memory (7 of 8 boards) in the
machine... are we missing one? is it out for repair? does anyone know?

Craig: Any help we can get on getting the other RH11 fixed, or the memory
       checked out... I doubt these stopcodes are all software problems...
       also that first drive, write-locked lamp...

Subject: ABLE dual I/O model 10039 

1) I have the documentation from Dennis Ernst in my office.  He believes
   one of the DR's on the card still works, but doesn't know which one.

2) Bill Wu mentioned that ABLE is still doing business and we could most
   probably have the card repaired by them, thus giving us our full DR-11
   link capability for our network.

Subject: "Re: Our micronet... Well... there"... 

Re: Our micronet...

Well... there has been a proposal to put our hosts and the bases for them
(which is a major portion of our micronet) in another building about 1.5
miles north of South Bay Center.  TYMNET plans to build a computer room to
house many engines and we may rent floor space from them for our machines.
A decision about this is supposed to be made on Monday.  It will save FSC
money by not having to build a computer room, and just having to rent the
floor space in a TYMNET facility (at a lower rate than at South Bay Center),
and it would save TYMNET some money since we would be renting the space in
their building.

What is not being considered is what it would cost for modems, leased lines
and the people time and expense to travel that 1.5 miles every time we need
to do anything with our machines.  (It may be being considered, but it does
not appear in the "bottom line" figures like building a room does).

If you know what the going rate for 9600 baud modems is, please send mail to
Craig (and me) so we can find out what this will cost us...  same for leased
lines from PAC-TEL.

We can still run a line (preferably 2) from our nodes at this new site to one
or two LSI-11s (we just happen to have 1 good extra 11/03-SE,BA11-ME set, a
dubious 11/03-SE,BA11-ME set and an 11/03-LJ (old 2346) which could be setup
with DZV-11s and give us our hard-wired lines as well as our LN03 connection.
It means 1 or 2 lines at 9600 will knock us down in data speed, especially if
we only have one line and we do any printing. I'll show you the alternatives
we have when I see you on Monday.

Subject: Incidental location costs 

Craig,
  Dennis Ernst tells me we can not expect to run our DUV-11 or DUP-11 line
at speeds greater than 9600.  The devices will do 19.2, but the software and
the LSI-11 cannot handle the interrupts at those speeds... in fact they are
often having data over-runs at 9600 due to the single interrupt capability
in the 11/03.

  If we assume we are to house our machines 1.5 miles away from our normal
workplace with no actual operational support, is anyone taking into account
the reduced productivity caused by having to drive that 3 miles, parking 2
times (assuming that the light rail does not extend that far?), or the cost
of having to drive or take public transportation just to reload our hosts
or the micro-bases?

  Or... the fact that we would more or less be unable to car pool on any
given day, (since we might need our own auto at any time to drive over to
our lab machines?)

  I realize that these qustions might seem picky, not to mention the extra
expense of communications, maybe forcing us to use more TYMNET resources on
the public net...  we might not actually save anything in the long run by
moving our machines to another site...  >>KICK<< >>TUMBLE<<  [soapbox just
forcibly removed from beneath my feet].

  Anyway, I think I've voiced what concerns that have come to haunt me.

Subject: Micronet and Host numbers 

I've talked to validations and tehy see no reason why we cannot use some of
the two-digit host numbers for our hosts.  I still need to check with Ed Roop
about using some of the old 940 host numbers (although Jan said we could use
36 after this weekend, and 57 at the end of May) such as 10 thru 21. If so,
we can then re-use 118, 930 and 934 for DZ-11 and DZV-11 devices on our net
so that we can build circuits to them from TYMNET.

More later... probably by meeting time on Wednesday.

Subject: Takeit %50 

I modified TAKEIT to continue even though it cannot access DSK or create
a LOG file.  (IF it can, it will.  If not, C'est la vie).

I also added code to set and clear KSYS.

Except for one small detail of the HOLD command (TAKEIT keeps an internal
counter and holds it steady, while the monitor KSYS counter doesn't have
the capability to "hold" at a specific value) which needs to be discussed
and implemented based on that discussion, TAKEIT %50 is ready for testing.

One possibility is for TAKEIT to reset the KSYS word in the monitor each
minute.  I put in the hooks and code for that, but it isn't quite turned
on (Need to move it to another location).

Another is that we set the sign bit, (only allowing 17 bits for the value)
and the sign-extended 18th bit says HOLD the current value.  (Since we do
not allow the monitor to go negative... true? [I didn't check]).

We can also change the SETUUO to use ac/ fn,addr   addr/ bits,,time
   or even better                    ac/ bits+fn,,time
   or add another setuuo or two... HOLD KSYS, CONTINUE KSYS

Subject: Cause of GTSAP1 stopcode in /A02, /A05, and /B03. 

There were two changes to SWAMP involved.  1) A DSKOFF instruction was moved to
avoid possible race conditions, and 2) better load balancing by putting new 
files on the unit with most space. 

The real problem was when the DSKOFF instruction was moved and the nearby
"JRST .-3" was not noticed.  The fix was to put a label at the right place and
jump to it.  The bug did not cause problems on a lightly loaded system, the
GTSAP1 crash occurred only when SAT I/O was in progress at the instant that
a new job tried to log in.

The second change caused SAT I/O to occur when new files were being created.
It forced the RIB of the new file to be created on the unit with the most
space instead of the SAT that happened to be in core.

Now that both changes are in and working properly, the monitor allocates disk
space better.  This should cause a noticable performance improvement when
DSKB is rebuilt from TITO all-files.   /Joe

REFSTR assigns 64 pages for the KS front-end file (SYS)FEFILE.SYS, and

The first time a full DSKCLN is run after refreshing the disk, the pages

As an interim solution, I have modified INITIA to not start the XEXEC job
if the file (XEXEC)INITIA.SYS does not exist.  Instead, it will output
"?INITIA cannot run XEXEC until (XEXEC)INITIA.SYS is restored from tape."
every 5 minutes until the file is created or until the OPER kills the
job.  Until Carl finishes SUBOPR, this will ensure that XEXEC does not
start after the full DSKCLN that is necessary between restoring SYS and
the rest of the structure.

If (XEXEC)INITIA.SYS is accidently deleted, just create a new one.  It
doesn't matter what's in the file as long as it exists.

Joe,
  Your solution may be a kludge, but it's elegant!  It could probably even be
beyond the class of kludge if it were not a temporary measure.   (I know, an
"elegant kludge" is an oxymoron.  But among kludges, yours is truly elegant.)

Subject: Host numbers less than 256. 

The KI and KL based PDP10 systems can only use host numbers in the range for
1 to 255.  This is because there is a one-byte field used by the PDP10 to tell
its base what host number it wants to use.  This information is passed on to
the supervisor when the PDP10 comes up - it is not set by the base node's
TYM file.  Since any PDP10 can pretend to be any host in this range, it would
help us if we were to have a list of the status of all host numbers from 1 to
255 inclusive.

At one time, Field Service Company was using host numbers 107 and 108 when
bringing up a system in test mode.  Now it appears that those host numbers
are treated special by the Supervisor.  Therefore we would like to know which
host numbers it is safe to use.

It uses the same routine that is now part of "TYPE BAT" in the FILES dialog.
If you run (MPL)TYPBAT on 930, the F3 is having problems with record 0 on
head 0 of many cylinders.  If you run it on any of the other systems, you
will see that the 3652 disks have not bad spots, the 3675 disks have a log
of bat spots, and they are all on record 14 of an odd head.  The pattern is
so strong, it looks like BPXKON is having problems.      /Joe

Subject: /B04 is expected to have several "%% EVENT stopcode BADPAG" messages. 

Running /B02 or later once will activate the badblock recording routines.
/B04 will output a message on the CTY when a badblock is detected, all
previous monitors noticed the badblock but never said anything.

This means that system that starts running /B04 on the old disks is expected
to get sporadic BATPAG messages until the first time an ASP is done.  During
the ASP, flurry of up to 20 BADPAG messages would not be unusual.  After the
ASP completes, the number of new BADPAG messages should slow to less than
one a week.  Operations can run (MPL)TYPBAT to see how bad the disks are.

The point I'm trying to make is that the sudden flare-up of BADPAG messages
is not the fault of the new monitor.  The disks are getting read errors and
a deficiency in the previous monitors caused problems to not be reported.

Subject: Possible explanation for the multitude of BADPAG occurances. 

We have observed two kinds of bad spots on the disk.  A real one is consistantly
bad - you couldn't read it last week and you can't read it this week.  All the
bad spots on 930 (62's disk) are real.  A phantom bad spot causes a read error
once - copying the file to itself clears up the read error.  Almost all of the
read errors on the IBM disks are phantom.

It looks now as if there is (and always has been) a bug in BPXKON.  Whenever the
monitor decides to read in a bunch of pages on the same cylinder, it calls
BPXKON repeatedly until BPXADD says it can't handle any more.  If the pages are
contiguous on disk and contiguous in core, BPXADD is given a request that could
very easily exceed the size of the command list.  When this occurs, BPXADD is
committed to do the transfer, so it has to split it up and do the second part
after getting an interrupt from the first part done.  When a request spans the
track boundry, BPXKON has to create a new select-head command before it
continues building read commands.  I do not like the code that handles end-of-
track and changed that section in CPXKON.

My reason for suspecting BPXKON is that for all but 2 of the read errors, it
was for records 15-18 of an even track.  If BPXADD did not recognize the end
of the track, it would attempt to read records 19-22 of the current track
instead of 1-3 of the next track.  Of all the ERRCHK reports I looked at, they
all said "Search error, Count error, Record 18".

If BPXKON did have this failure in the past, a read error would occur when the
read request filled up the command list and overflowed onto the next track at
the same time.  This scenario is a virtual certainty when running ASP.  ASP
would get 30 errors per disk, not report them (because it turned off error
checking on read), and CORE1 would attempt to log them in the BAT pages when
the pages were released.  Since the BAT self-pointers were not initialized,
nothing would get into the BAT pages.  The only trace left that a read error
had occured is that the "M" bit would be set so the page would not be 
recycled.  This would last only until the next DSKCLN, at which there would
be no log of the phantom read error.

P035/B04 had two changes.  One is that the read errors get logged to the CTY
as BADPAG stopcodes and logged in the BAT pages.  The second is that MAPIO
now makes new files be allocated to contiguous pages on disk when it is
convenient to do so.  This second change makes disk I/O more efficient.  It
also increases the probability that programs other than ASP will cause the
channel command list to get filled up and trigger the BPXKON bug.  CPXKON does
not exhibit this bug.

Therefore I suggest we go forward with /B04 on all 3650/3652 systems.
Until BPXKON is fixed (or CPXKON verified as reliable with 3675 blocks),
the 3675 disk systems should NOT run /B04 (or /B05).

To verify some of the things I've said, we need to run ASH on all systems.
If it is BPXKON, then unreported read errors would cause ASP to write bad
data to tape.  If system 39 is any indication, then the bug means that 30
out of 68680 pages per unit were written bad.

Subject: Hack to BPXKON installed on 58. 

The unit data block has enough room in the command list to handle 18 blocks
(1 track).  If a request for several contiguous blocks starts in the middle
of the track, then it will hit the end of the track before it hits the end
of the command list.  A portion of the spaghetti code near TRNCNT is supposed
to handle this, switch to the next head, and continue adding until the
command list is full.  That is one of the places I was uncomfortable with.
By putting a JFCL at TRNCNT+3, BPXADD won't do any fancy footwork to fake out
FILIO.  It will simply take the non-skip return, which tells FILIO to not add
anything more until the transfer-done interrupt comes in for the current
request.  Then FILIO will resume with the next block (which need not be on
a page boundry).

I logged in to 58 to test this, and found it SHUT due to all the "hard" errors.
Without the patch, ASH got several errors within the first 7000 pages.  With
the patch installed, it got no errors.   I zeroed out the BAT blocks so we
and the CTY can see new entries.  /Joe

If the command list is big enough to hold 25 blocks, then there were cases

Subject: System 38 will bring up P035/B07 tonight. 

I looked at the tracks left in the circular buffer and found a cause of
THUNGs.  There were several outstanding read requests, including one for unit
324.  When a request for 314 was added, for some reason it got a busy signal.
This is normal, the unit will be restarted when the not-busy signal comes in.
When the transfer on unit 324 finished, the not-busy signal came in as if it
were for units 320-327 instead of for units 300-317 as was expected.  Therefore
CPXKON tried to restart waiting units on BPB (unit 324 is BPB4), but not the
units on BPA (unit 314 is BPA14).  The THUNG was because unit 314 was not
restarted within 3 seconds.  Until we teach COMMOD and CPXKON that a single
controller (BPA) can have more than 16 disks, I put in a one-line hack that
restarts all waiting units when the not-busy signal comes in.  It will now find
any waiting unit, be it on BPA, BPB, BPC, or BPD.

Subject: Why /B07. 

Craig and Dennis:
  The previous message did not mention that the decision to create 38XB07
was made by Osman, Carl and myself.  The change is one line to CPXKON, but
is necessary to solve the THUNG problem on 38 and 3652 systems.  We also
decided that all systems currently running /B06 should come up on /B07 as
soon as possible.  The systems we scheduled to run /B06 next week will be
running /B07 at that time.

The correct fix (which will be after P035/C) will be to teach COMMOD and
CPXKON that there can be more than 2 strings on a controller.  The places
that currently store 16 flag bits in a halfword need to be modified to
handle 64 bits in two words.  Then update the CONFIG files so that systems
with many strings on a single physical controller show up as a single
logical controller.  In particular, system 38 will have BPA0-BPA27 instead
of BPA0-BPA17 + BPB0-BPB7, and systems with 3652s will have BPA0-BPA7 +
BPA40-BPA47 instead of BPA0-BPA7 + BPC0-BPC7.

The above change will make CPXKON aware of reality.  When it determines that
controller "BPA" is busy, it will correctly understand that the units on all
4 strings on that controller are busy.  Prior to /B07, CPXKON figured that
because the second 2 strings were assigned to "BPB", that it was a seperate
piece of hardware, and was not affected by "BPA" being busy.

I expect 38XB07 will not get any THUNGS.    /Joe

The contents of JBTCMP,JBTCP2 are the low&high 2-word result of the
KL EBOX time (RDEACT instruction) since system startup.  JBTCMP(J) and
JBTCP2(J) contain the KL EBOX time per job, since login.

We currently throw away the MBOX time, by overwriting it with the EBOX
time.  ICP reports the total of the EBOX times for all jobs for the
interval taken, divided by the fraction of a second to give MCY/SEC.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


TYMCOM-10 Software Support will at times send mail to Operations
with instructions to bring a system up on a different monitor
and when it should be done.

Normally it is done during regular scheduled downtime.  The exceptions
to this rule are:

     a.  If a system is continuously going down; or

     b.  If USERS' are having problems with their software; or,

     c.  Problems of an EMERGENCY nature.

In these cases, they may request the system be recycled immediately
after they have solved the problem.  The crash code to use during
this recycle is the same crash code that was used when the problem
first developed.

Whatever shift this occurs on, the Operator should contact their Shift
Supervisor, or Senior Operator.  Please contact me if you cannot contact
the Shift Supervisor, or Senior Operator.
                                                                Page  2


The Shift Supervisor, or Senior Operator, should insure that the system
logbook has complete information entered into it.  They should also 
insure that:

     a.  SSW #4 is set

     b.  A note put on the CTY as to what monitor to bring system
         up on when recycled again or if the system should go down.

     c.  A monitor tape made for the host to use for COLDSTARTS.

     d.  Run DSKMAP to see if it has been updated.

     e.  Run R CRSHID;/SYS on the host to check monitor versions
         installed.

     f.  If there is a difference, then run RU (QASYS)MAPUPD.
         This program will update the DSKMAP.

     g.  When completed, run DSKMAP again and post it on the
         mainframe.

Please contact me if you have questions.

Thanks;

Subject: Created /B08 instead of /B07-1. 

As per discussion (with JMS, CARL, OSMAN, DENCOFF present), the fix system
38's FTACFC crash will not be distributed as a DDT patch.  Instead, /B08
will replace all copies of nnXB07.SAV.

The crash on F38 showed FTA3 was given a command, FTA1 interrupted while
waiting for FTA3 to finish so FTA1 was given a new command, then the unit
check on FTA3 was noticed.  Due to what appears to be a minor glitch in the
SA10 microcode, the pointer stored at memory location 300+2 implied FTA1
when the unit-check was reported for FTA3 at location 300+1.  This
inconsistancy caused the FTACFC stopcode, which is the same as KAF with
CH1's PC indicating a loop at PI channel 3 at SGPREV in FTASER.  The patch
is to set T4 to a reasonable value and return instead of getting stuck in
a very slow loop searching 256K for the bogus pointer.

Subject: Maximum jobs versus disks. 

Our current monitor configuration can handle only 32 jobs when 64 disks 
(8 strings) are defined.  Lowering the number of disks to 48 allows 80 jobs,
and with 32 disks 128 jobs can be handled.

These limits are based on the restriction currently in ONCE that the entire
monitor (including the symbol table) fit in 112K of unpaged core.

Subject: "Brought F29 up on NEWMON manually"... 

Brought F29 up on NEWMON (P035/B08) manually to rerun HS2287 ONTYME
accounting tape.  This was done to see if the system would cacrash with the same STOPCODE that occurred on 22 Jun.

After bringing the system up, I mounted this tape of FTA2
and started the restore.  I also mounted a tape on FTA1 and started
storing the directory of UTIL to it.

The accounting tape stopped after "Creating User Information" typed
out (same place as before).  The TITO tape stopped shortly after this.
Approximately one minute later, F29 went down with same "KAK" stopcode.

(That's KAF, not KAK)

I then dismounted the tapes and brought the  system up.  I have the
hardcopy if additional information is needed.

Thanks Rick.  This is very valuable information.  Please save the tape
that causes the crash.  We will be talking about this in our group meeting
this afternoon and come up with another patch/fix to the monitor to
fix the problem.

Subject: License... 

As per our "wall" discussion, I'd like you to think about this:

What if,  license on a file worked like a "protection".
          If a file has more license than the process attempting to
          update or supersede (ENTER UUO) then the "ENTER" fails.
          Rename to reduce the license (or increase the license) would
          always succeed if the process has the final license.

So, just as you cannot delete a file marked NO NO NO, you can rename it
    to a lower protection, and delete it.

So, a file with license can only be copied by a process with that or greater
    license.  It can be renamed, reducing the license, then copied, renamed
    or deleted.

    This also prevents accidently renaming a file, losing it's license, and
    never knowing it....  a current problem, not so much a security risk.

--------------------
So, what about TELECOPY, of files with license?  Trying to copy files to
files on other systems without license would fail (as it should).  TELECOPY
should be fixed as part of implementing such a scheme (as it would need to
be fixed, in order to work correctly).
--------------------

What do we really lose?  The convenience of being able to create a file and
then have to manually put license on it.  If a file has a license and it is
to be superseded, the license goes away (unless it is specified in the ENTER)
(which many programs such as LINK do not know enough to do).

I'm not advocating this change.... I just want us to think about it, and
how something similar could help our "license" problems with new, restored,
updated, copied, stolen programs and/or data.

One feature we would like to keep is the current one where if the job has
enough license, and the existing destination file has any license, then a
superseding ENTER preserves license.  That is "!GET (OSU)LOGINN" followed
by "!SSAVE (SYS)LOGINN" preserves the old protection and license.  Is this
what you meant by "license should be like protection"?  I agree that a frame
that has WF but not JL should get an error on ENTER if it were to try to
supersede (SYS)LOGINN.SHR.

Subject: License disappears (sometimes) on RENAME. 

After reading Carl's message I did some testing.  I GFDed to SPL, and then,
without setting license, I tried ".RENAME COPY.S=COPY.SAV".  The file COPY.SAV
had JL and RF license before and after.  (And still after renaming back to
COPY.SAV.)  Then I tried ".RENAME (JMS)COPY.SAV=(SPL)COPY.SAV".  The license
disappeared when the file changed directories!  After reinstating JL and RF,
I tried renaming it the other direction, from my logged in directory to the
GFDed directory.  License went away.  One last test was to reset everything
and set WF only on my frame and then try renaming across directories.  This
time RF survived (since it is implied by WF) but JL did not.

Until today I did not know that license got left behind on a RENAME.  It is
not what I expected.  However the preservation of license when doing
 "RENAME (SYS)PROGRAM.OLD=(SYS)PROGRAM.SAV" is a feature worth preserving.

Subject: License again 

Yes, want to preserve:  load/get program; SSAVE program     keeps license
      if you have the same license... although, if you don't have ALL the
      license, I think it ought to fail... you should NOT be able to do
      anything by way of ENTER if you do not have same or greater license.

Rename across directories, if you don't have license, it goes away... as
      expected.  Are you saying that if you HAVE the license, it also goes
      away just because it is across directories?  (It should always go
      away if you don't have it [now] whether or not it is across dir's
      but you should be able to rename license across dir's if you have it!)

My suggestion is to make the enter fail, if you do NOT h
ave enough license
which would cause a "protection"/"license" failure and abort...  so people
can't "accidently" rename or copy over a file that has license.

Subject: Hotline (type) call 

System F30 was experiencing a rise in hard device errors on BPA6.  They
took the system down to do a PAKCOP of the pack (3675's) and saw the same
hardware check problem we had with system 38 two weeks ago.

Rick called and wanted to know if it was OK to use Joe's modified PAKCOP.
I said, go... and we realized that that version was for 3650's in blocks.
We decided to run ASP version 7 to copy out the pack to tape and then do
a restore to a new pack.

We did a compare of the save prior to the restore and found 78(*) pages that
did not copy exactly.  Nothing was done to see how "off" the pages were.
We restored the tapes to a new drive/pack and I created a file with 78 pages
in it for DSKCLN to find multiply used pages and mark the files bad.

System came up with a FULL DSKCLN and reported errors as expected in RECOV.SYS
and on the console.  One UFD was affected.  Operations has the list of files
from FNDBAD to restore and the UFD name to work through the all-files and
backups.

I told them to call us if they had any more problems.

We received a verbal "thanks" from both Bob Fischer and Cheryl Eldred for
saving them a rebuild.

   (XEXEC)RDIST                    Tymcom-X                     (XEXEC)RDIST


   SYNOPSIS

           Remote file distribution.

   SYNTAX

           RDIST outfile=f1,f2,...,fn/USER:u/HOST:h/CHECK/LIST/TRACE/VERBOSE

   DESCRIPTION

           RDIST maintains  duplicate copies of  selected files  on multiple
           systems.   This is  accomplished by  building a  circuit  to each
           system  and running  the (SPL)FINDIT  program to  obtain creation
           date, checksum, protection and license data on the  files.  RDIST
           then  builds a  TELECOPY command  file and  executes  TELECOPY to
           update those files which have incorrect checksums.

           The parameters are as follows:

             outfile=      output file for status log; default is no log

             f1,f2,...,fn  files to be updated, each may contain user name
                           and wild cards; if no user name is given the
                           one given by /USER:u is assumed; default is *.*

             /USER:u       login name to build circuit under (requires AC
                           license); default is current user

             /HOST:h       list of host numbers to update; default is all

             /CHECK        do everything but run TELECOPY

             /LIST         generate list only; does not compare files or
                           run TELECOPY; replaces running FINDIT via MHX

             /TRACE        show circuit traffic on terminal for debugging

             /VERBOSE      show status of each file, even if its current;

   CAVEATS

           The program has no way to correct bad protection or license.

In-reply-to: I53791@Ontyme.Tymnet of 30 JUN 87 17:09:49

I could not find a dump of the crash from 30-JUN-87.  However, the message
"?PAR ERR 277 001 300" means that a memory parity error was detected by
Unibus Adaptor #3.  This indicates a possible hardware problem in the
memory boards, the memory controller, or UBA3.

I looked at CRA001.SAV which was a crash dump from 8-JUN-87.  In it, the
IRING and ORING pointers indicate that either the KMC or the LSI-11 wasn't
doing its job since the ORING was completely full.  Most of the time when
this happens to us, the LSI-11 has halted.  We simply reload the LSI-11 and
the KS2020 and don't bother with saving a crash dump.

As for the stopcode message, TTYBNP means Block I/O Not in Progress.
This can happen when the LSI-11 scribbles garbage in the IRING just before
it halts.  There's not much that can be done other than reloading the LSI-11
node and the KS2020.

From the TYMCOM-X Support Group.
In reference to memo from Ed Roop dated June 4, 1987.

We are currently running a monitor with 32 disk addresses defined.  F74
has 29 active spindles disks, F38 had 28 active disks before it was
converted.  Running with 32 units of model 3675 disks is not a problem.

We have run a test monitor configured for a 3652 system with 32 addresses
and a test monitor configured for a 3652 system with 64 addresses.
Although only 1 string of 3652 disks was connected at the time, we see no
problems with using a second string of 3652 disks due to the uniformity
of disk addressing.  All 32 addresses go through the same 3674 controller.

Due to the current limitation on the size of the resident monitor, a
system can be configured for more than 32 addresses only at the expense
of the number of jobs the system can handle.

        A monitor with 32 disks can be defined with 128 jobs.
        A monitor with 48 disks can be defined with  80 jobs.
        A monitor with 64 disks can be defined with  32 jobs.

Note that each additional string of 3652 disks (with 16 addresses)
reduces the maximum number of jobs by 48.  There is an absolute maximum
of 64 units per structure.  Defining the DSKB structure with more than
32 units is not recommended.  Recovering from an HDA failure on a 48 unit
DSKB would take more than 48 hours of down-time.

Unless the sytems were to use multiple structures, we cannot recommend
attaching more than 32 disk units per CPU.

Subject: Host numbers!!! 

We (finally) received the host numbers we ordered back in May.  We ordered
four 2-digit host numbers for PDP-10 development use.  We received...

    14, 14, 16 and 17 for our use

We also received, in late May, four 4-digit host numbers for our use.
(I don't have these handy, but will save them away for later).

With these 8 numbers, and the ones we already have, we should be able
to configure our micronet with printer devices accessible from the real
network.

Subject: RDIST suggestions. 

I noticed that /USER applies to the aux circuit that runs FINDIT and FINDIT
itself, but not to TELECOPY.  That is, when logged in as JMS, TELECOPY can read
or create files in M33, but cannot supercede files in M33 because the aux
circuit built by TELECO is for JMS not M33.  That's the main reason why I added
the /MASTER switch, so that RDIST could be run on the destination system GFD'd
to the right directory as a SUBMIT job.  (My changes are in (JMS:39)RDIST.SAI).

Another thing to consider in the next version is a /GATEWAY command so that
B39 can be kept current with the rest of the world.  /Joe

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick,
 
The following is a list of topics operation's personnel would liked addressed
in PDP seminars.
 
1)  Hardware
    A)  Define each component and its purpose
    B)  How each component interacts with the other
 
2)  Memory
    A)  What is it?
    B)  How and why do we deselect memory?
 
3)  System Structure & File Structure
    A)  What is it?
    B)  How is it defined and why?
    C)  Disolving and defining a file structure.
    D)  Blocks vs pages
    E)  How are files stored on disk? What are the differences between
        3675's, 3650's and 3652's.
 
4)  ASP, ALLFILES & Daily Backups
    A)  What each one is.
    B)  What each would be used for.  (i.e. rebuild, restore of bad file)
 
5)  Monitors
    A)  What are they?
 
6)  DSKCLN
    A)  What a FULL DSKCLN is and what it does?
    B)  What a FAST DSKCLN is and what it does?
    C)  How to determine if a FULL or FAST is required.
 
7)  Pakcop
    A)  What is it?
    B)  How does it work?
 
8)  Rebuilds
    A)  Process of a rebuild
    B)  What backup (Allfiles, Daily & ASP) is appropriate for rebuilds.
        (Examples of different scenarios.)
 
 
 
These are only topics that we find that we would absolutely need presented.
Additional topics that you or Tymcom10 software/hardware support feel would
be beneficial to operation's personnel would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks,
 
Cheryl

1.  As long as 62 and 930 are both working, we can reload the microbases from
the other CPU.  The 2020 can reload its microbase and 2346, but nothing else.
6657:	Use NODLOD on 62.  10115 and 2346 must be up.
10115:	Use NODLOD on 930.  6657 and 2346 must be up.
2346:	Use NODLOD on 62, 930, or 95.  The host's base must be up.
2770:	Use NODLOD on 62 or 930.  Intervening nodes must be up.
6760:	Use NODLOD on 95 running in CONSOLE mode.
Note:  After a complete power failure, 6657 and 10115 must be reloaded from
the network.  With host 57 gone, WE CAN'T RUN LOADII!!!!!! 

2. Out Dial information is in the INFO tree, topic OUTDIAL.

Subject: PDP-10 coding trick 

  In putting together my own octal print routine for my SETOP endeavor
I chose to combine the octal and decimal print routines into one.  This
had the side effect that octal numbers with the sign bit set became
a weird set of punctuation marks (since I had an unsigned print routine).

		  OOPS!

  If you start with a standard routine such as this...

  num = 1
  rem = num+1

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

  I came up with this interesting bit of code as a work around that I had
never encountered in any bag of PDP-10 coding tricks...

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
; ** begin trick **
	EXCH	num,rem			; setup number in remainder word
	SETZ	num,			; for 2-word divide instead
	LSHC	num,1			; shift sign (if any) to high word
	LSH	rem,-1			; shift low word back into position
	DIV	num,rad			; first divide, results same as IDIV
	CAIA				; or JRST .+2 to skip first divide
; ** end trick **
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

; Have you ever seen this used anywhere before?

PS.  TYMCOM-X only...
    replace
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)
	OUTCHR	num
    with
	OUTCHI	"0"(num)		; outchr immediate

Thank you for checking with us.  It is bound to screw up
somebody, but nobody at NTD.  I think (SYS)NAD is used
mostly by Tymnet operations and private network customers.
It seems to me they need an alternative means to access
their code, but I don't understand what the procedures
are so I can't suggest such an alternative.  *SIGH*  I
think this is gross negligence on someone's part, but it
is unfortunate that our customers will be the ones to
suffer for it.  I knew about the WF on NAD, but was told
that it enforced its own security, which it at least used
to because I frequently have gotten protection failures
trying to read source code I'm assembling (being in a
different GAN than most of NTD) when I forget to set RF.

I propose more investigation before any action, even
as gross as this appearently is, it can probably be
left alone a couple more days.  I would normally
volunteer to help investigate, but this is a very bad
time.

Thanks

It sounds like you have done more investigation.  I did a tiny bit, too, and
I see (SOURCE)NAD with HF on 70.  Presumably that is the only way that
a customer can access the files in (SOURCE) since they are mostly ALL RD NO.
However, if NAD does not enforce security itself, this is still a problem
because we do not want customers to be able to read/write even the source
directory except to assemble (but not make listing of) the files therein.
Although this is a smaller box than (SYS)NAD with WF, it still needs to be
addressed one way or another.  -Bill

?INFO stopcode "SAXINY" at 02-Aug-1987 12:33:32   T4 = 400000,,421043
?INFO stopcode "SAXINY" at 02-Aug-1987 12:33:38   T4 = 400000,,421143

In the right half:
  400000 = Interrupt request from SA10
   20000 = SA10 channel 1 (disk) is enabled for interrupt
    1000 = The "GO" flag is set for SA10 channel 1 (disk)
     100 = Status available from channel 0 (tape)
      40 = Status available from channel 1 (disk)
       3 = SA10 is using PI channel 3

In the left half:
  400000 = Dummy bit set to indicate that one of bits 29-32 are set in RH
     000 = Octal unit device address (8 bits)

SAXINY means that one of the two disk controllers has told the SA10 to
interrupt the PDP-10, but the controller did not identify itself.  Controller
BPA (which is wired for 'C0' to 'CF') is supposed to report unit device
addresses in the range 300 to 317 and controller BPB (wired for 'D0' to 'DF')
is supposed to report unit device addresses in the range 320 to 337.  All the
SAXINY reports I have looked at show a unit device address of 000.  One of
the two controllers is returning bad status.

SAXINY occurs whenever the system gets an interrupt and cannot identify which
particular disk (or controller) was the cause of the interrupt.  THUNG occurs
when a disk transfer is started, but the "done" interrupt gets lost.  I would
expect each THUNG to be preceded by a SAXINY report.     /Joe

Subject: RDIST missing files 

Hmmm.  That may be the same bug that causes "ls" to miss files.  All of
these programs use the (SAILIB)REDUFD routines which are strongly suspected
to be the source of this problem, although never reported before for the
RDIST or FINDIT programs.  Carl believes it has something to do with files
with strange names such as those found in (MAIL) with a PPN for a file name,
and those found in any directory with soft deleted files.  I suspect that
if the first character of a file name is a blank that other files which
follow that file in the UFD block may not be seen by REDUFD.  I have been
unable to see any obvious cause for this in the REDUFD source, but I only
looked at it for about 5 minutes one day.  I have not performed any
experiments.  -Bill

Subject: re:FINDIT %10 

New FINDIT %10 to be distributed soon...  Now includes ARGPAR.

The only visible change to anyone using FINDIT the old way is that the
line "End of SAIL execution." is no longer printed in any case, and some
programs such as RDIST may look for such a line to terminate processing.
The prompt has NOT been changed, so programs waiting for a second prompt
should not be affected.

Joe,
  I've removed the dependency on files in directory VMAP from FINDIT.  The
sources are now in directory SPL where they belong.  We need to talk about
/STICKY and whether/how we want to make it work in FINDIT.

I, for one, do not like having to specify the directory for every file when
only a single directory is being searched (especially when it's a long name)
but I do not want to lose the capability of searching for files in every
directory.

A new version of FINDIT.SAV has been installed on SPL and XEXEC on system
F32 and system D35.  The new version %10 of FINDIT uses the argpar package
and has two (2) switches: /CHECKSUM and /QUIET.  The default values are
/CHECKSUM (list checksums in formatted output) and /NOQUIET (allow output
to appear on the terminal when an output file is selected).

Oh yes, this means the output can be sent to a file and /QUIET says to send
it ONLY to the file, not to both the file and the terminal.

/NOCHECKSUM will cause six (6) blanks to be printed instead of the checksum
in the output, and of course, no checksumming of the files will be done.


To Joe:  Since you have RF on the file, I will let you transmit the new
         version to all systems... sufice that it is on 32 and 35 for now.

ARGPAR means that FINDIT can be run at command level.. however, I have made
sure that it acts just like it used to if you say FINDIT or R (SPL)FINDIT.

Subject: How to patch the CPU serial number into a monitor SAV file. 

There are three consecutive locations, starting at .CPLOG which describe
the CPU ID.  To look at them, use .CPLOG$6T/=<lf>=<lf>.
  .CPLOG has 2 or 3 letter hardware designation in LH, node number in RH.
  .CPCPU has 'KI', 'KL', etc in LH, APRID number (in decimal) in RH.
  .CPSNO has system number (such as 'F22') in sixbit.
The sixbit quantities can be left or right justified.  I changed 33035C.SAV to
22035C.SAV by using:
  .CPLOG/ $"/XXX/,,3374
  .CPCPU/ $"/KL/,,1421.
  .CPSNO/ $"/F22/
When the new KL is installed, the right half of .CPCPU must be changed.  /Joe

The first UFD data page for (SYS:26) was on BPA3 page 10010.  That was one
of the pages that PAKCOP could not read, and had pointers to LOGINN and RPG.
DSKCLN aborted with "Error in RIB - wrong hash code" and "Critical file
damaged".  Page 0 was indeed garbage, and the 2nd page for that hash code
was 10.  After zeroing the offending paged and putting 10 in the link at 777,
the UFD was readable.  Having REFLAG, I restored all of SYS until TITO asked
to overwrite a file.  Typing control-C at that point caused TITO to report
that 102 files were processed, exactly one page worth.  F26 is running a
full DSKCLN at this moment.  /Joe

The project was canceled before anyone wrote TUMS.HLP, so...  there is

needs to send me his ontyme name, password and PDP-10 user name.  It is
somewhat expensive, so I don't want to do a whole bunch, but a few is OK.
There is no interface at this time to the 370 except through PROFS which

One warning about sending ONTYME name, ONTYME password, and PDP-10 user name
to WRS:  once this is set up, you not have any messages on ONTYME anymore.
They all get forwarded to the PDP10 system of your choice and are removed
from your ONTYME "in" and "in old" folders.  People can still send to your
ONTYME username, but you will be reading them on the PDP10.  You can send
to ONTYME users from any PDP10.  In otherwords, you don't have to deal with
ONTYME's archaic command processor anymore.

I currently have it set up so that mail sent to TXS.J/SMITH@ONTYME or to
FSC.JM/SMITH@ONTYME is forwarded to JMS@D35.TYMNET, and mail from me to
any ONTYME username gets sent as being from TXS.J/SMITH@ONTYME.  I have
a MAIL.FWD file on all PDP10s that causes TUMS mail on all systems to be
forwarded to JMS@D35.  Since we have modified crashmail on F33 to use TUMS,
that means that system 33's crashmail to me is arriving here at D35.

When P035/D is ready, it will be easy to get all the Dallas PDP10 crash mail
to one PDP10.  Use "R SENDMAIL" to JMS if you have any more questions.  /Joe

Subject: Version number 

Again, (today is not my day), I was mistaken.  The version number is
a decimal number.  Herewith is what TITO looks at, for it;'s feature test.

;
;	The definition of a version number string is xyyy-Pmmm/zrr-nn
;	where
;	    x	is a center number, e.g. "C" for Cupertino
;	  yyy	is the system number, e.g. "930", or "33", etc.
;	    -	separates the system number from the monitor name.
;	    P	is historical and is always "P".
;	  mmm	is the major version in decimal, currently "034".
;	    /	separates the major and minor versions.
;	   zz 	is the minor version, normally a single letter (A-Z)
;		however it may be more, thus A-Z is less than AA.
;		also: AA + 1 is BA (not AB), thus each letter is
;		valued at <1-26>+<1-26 *26>+<1-26 *26^2>...
;	   rr	is a development revision and should not normally
;		appear on customer systems, e.g. /K34.
;	    -	separates the version number from the patch count.
;	   nn	is the patch count and initially is not present,
;		e.g.  /K-7  or  /K34-1.
;

This took a considerable amount of sleuthing to put together when I di it
way back when for TITO, and the only thing "wrong" with this defnition is
that the "P" may not be "P".  MONED1 is hardcoded to look for "Pnnnnn.MEM"
so we will have to change that if we go to Q001/A  {Yuk, it looks terible}

Subject: XEXEC Monitor solution! 

Joe,
  I've come up with a solution to the problem XEXEC has with the universal
identifier JBTUID which currently restarts at 1 each time the system is
reloaded.  If instead of using a monotonically increasing number, we set
the UID to the universal-date-time, we will be guaranteed of unique UIDs
that will never be reused.  Thus, if a job number and UID match at any time
we know we have the right job.

  Of course, we know the UDT is accurate to 1/3 second, so what do we do
about jobs that would have the same UDT?  Simple... since we keep the last
UID, we now keep the last UDT used for a UID and if the current UDT matches,
we increment it by 1  (1/3 second isn't going to hurt anything).  It's a
small possibility that the UID could get ahead of the UDT but it wouldn't
stay ahead for very long.

  And last, but not least, we can redirect .GTJLT (130) to point to JBTUID
and be able to obtain the login time for a job.

  The change should be in FRMSER in FRMASN where the UDT is incremented and
set for each frame

*** I would like this change to be made in /C09 ***

rdmail uses the sail parser, tums uses one I wrote in FLIB.  I will put
it on the list of things to do to convert rdmail to use flib, until then
anyone having a dot in their username should just use tums to read their
mail or get the dot removed.  At least as many programs don't work as do.
I think getting rid of the dot is the best solution since nobody is about
to fix all the programs.  Originally, of course, dots were illegal.  The

The problem is in the CVFIL filespec decoder in the SAIL runtimes.  I showed
the problem to Mike and Adele ages ago after Scott went to NTD and it was
tabled by them because of declining language support.  CVFIL uses the same
routine to read usernames as it does file identifiers, only allowing twelve
characters instead of 6.  Changing the code to use a different routine that
accepts "." as well as the other special characters allowed in usernames is
trivial.  Then rebuilding the SAIL runtimes and re-distributing them is the
major "glitch"... Scott or Lois were the last to do this  and I'm not sure
what kind of documentation exists.

Bill, If you'd like us to make the change, we can...  let us know...

Subject: GAN-5 and other usernames 

Jan,
  There are a reasonable number of usernames that currently exist on the
PDP-10s that no one ever logs into.  Is there really any reason for those
usernames to exist in TYMNET?  Is there any reason why a set of usernames
or directories cannot exist only on the PDP-10s?

  The only stipulation being that those usernames cannot be assigned to
users that want to use the PDP-10s.  A user could have the name (DEC) and
be valid to talk to the DECNET gateways 411 and 412, but not be valid on
the PDP-10s.  On the PDP-10s we could have username (DEC) with a designated
PPN that isn't billed against (since it would be an IPC internal name).

  Maybe we should get together to talk about this... since if you and Ed
and Nancy and I can agree on what I'm proposing, it would solve the problem
with duplicate UUNs and reduce the cost incurred by IPC and by us in TYMNET.
(Why should we have billable username sin TYMNET if no one ever logs in?)

Sorry I did not get back to you sooner.
If the VT100 connected to the DN87 does not work when cable is stretched
out the the COEES area, you can try using a "line driver".  This device
plugs into the cable from the DN87 and boosts the signal so that it is
strong enough to go thru the multiple extension cords.

Another thing to watch out for is extension cords versus null modems.
An extension cord is wired pin-for-pin, so that pin 2 at one end is
connected to pin 2 at the other end and pin 3 to pin 3.  A null modem
has pin 2 at one end connected to pin 3 at the other end and vice versa.
The VT100 requires one and only one null modem cable between it and the
DN87.  Plugging two null modems together does not work (even if it does
have the right combination of male/female connectors) because the signals
get crossed.

On a related subject; if the LA36 that is the CTY is connected to the KL
via a current loop, it should be possible to have 2 LA36's connected in
series in the current loop, with one near the KL and one in the COEES area.
Ask the CE if this can be done.

Bonnie called me at 10 minutes to 8, and I responded late (at 9:20pm when
I returned home) that the Japanese customers were complaining about SPOOL
and BIONIK and a fortran program TOKTYP that were causing them problems.

This same problem occurred last week, DEC 22, when the SA-10 problem caused
them to put 74 on the spare KL. I presume they swapped the SA-10 and brought
things up on 74's base... 'cause the japanese customers reported the problems
fixed shortly after that.

I checked out BIONIK and BIONIC, Bonnie and I checked out TELECOPY and all
block-io programs appeared to be having problems.  BIONIC received every 4th
byte transmitted (? really ?) and TELECOPY failed miserably.

I found out they were using node 2100 for the base (?the bad one?) and had
Bonnie call FSC to have the base swapped out for Node 6722's hardware.  It
took until 2:00 for them to get the base loaded after the swap out.

The system answered by 2:40 and I logged in and tested BIONIC.  Cindy from
operations checked out TELECOPY and it worked ok.  I asked her to put a note
on the base 2100, that BLOCK-IO doesn't work on this base.  (I thought the
bad base was retired?)

System 74 is up on the spare KL (that is why it was using node 2100) because
the SA-10 is still down... need to check with FSC to find out when X32 will
be back with it's own SA-10.

Ken-san,  
     
How do you doing ?  
I heard you come to nis on Jan. 18. I look forward to meeting you again    
in Japan. 
By the way, I think you read Mr. Ogura's ontyme ( msg# M40201 dated 07
Jan. 88 ).
Now, I have serious problem of katakana version "BIONIK" which is
described in his ontyme. 
Our clients asked to us many complain about this matter.    
However, I have no evidence which I can supply you now.
But, I think I like to get the evidence as soon as possible.
Then, when I get the evidence, I don't know the right person which I contact.   
     
Please let me know the name of persons and his ontyme-id.   
     
In my old memory, Carl Baltrunas and Dennis Cofley were responsibilty 
for PDP system. Are they still be responsible ?   
     
See again in Tokyo. 
Best regards.  
Kamoi

Ken,
  Without more details of what data was substituted, we cannot reasonably
determine the exact nature of the problem that NIS was experiencing with
regards to their point 1, (modified or substituted characters in units of
a word).

  However, what is known is that on December 22nd, there was a problem on
system 74 with the SA-10 (the interface between the PDP-10 I/O buss and the
disk and tape drives).  My understanding is that system 74 was taken down
at 7am PST and brought up on the spare KL-10 CPU in the Fremont data center
by 11am PST.  The spare cpu worked fine, however the base hardware connected
to this cpu has a known problem with BLOCK-IO (which affects TELECOPY, BIONIC,
BIONIK and others).

  When the SA-10 on system 74 was fixed, the system came back up on it's
proper hardware at midnight (PST) of the 22nd and the problems that NIS was
having went away.

  On December 31st, more spurious disk problems were reported, and again the
SA-10 was suspect.  So system 74 was again brought up on the spare cpu at 9:45
PST with the "broken" base.  As of this message, system 74 is still running on
the spare cpu.  It is scheduled to return to it's own hardware on the 15th of
January.

  On January 3rd NIS again reported problems with BIONIK to operations and I
was called in to look at them.  I determined that the problem appeared to be
related to BLOCK-IO since all other network I/O appeared to behave correctly.
I asked operations to reload the base, so that we could rule out corrupted
base code.  They had reloaded the system a couple of hours earlier to try to
fix the problem.  The problem didn't change and I looked at the base with
probe and found that F74 was on the spare cpu and there was a good probablility
that it was connected to the "broken" base hardware.  I had operations call in
maintenance and swap the base hardware.  This was done in the early a.m. on
January 4th.  When the system came up, we tested BIONIC and TELECOPY and the
problems appeared to be solved.

  As regards to the "broken" base that is referred to above.  We use the spare
cpu and it's base as our working test system for software support.  From time
to time we have experienced problems with BLOCK-IO due to an intermittant
hardware problem.  I believe it was an oversight that when F74 was moved to
the space cpu, the base hardware was not immediately swapped with a known good
base.  Once the problem was identified as the base, the "broken" base was
swapped out and I do not expect that NIS will encounter any more problems due
to the base.

Ken, please check with Rick Daniels to verify that no other changes were made
to the hardware configuration than those mentioned above (before responding
to NIS).  If their problems occurred during the times specified above, even
thought they may not have been detected until a later date, then we have
pin-pointed the cause of their problems.  If not, we need to try to reproduce
their problems before we can try to fix them.

Rick, the times for the hardware swaps came from the system log book and the
center log book.  We didn't see any additional reports of problems or hardware
swaps.  Please verify that there were no additional changes.   Thanks!

Rick, we need to be aware that whenever we swap cpu's in the future, that we
do not swap to the "broken" base hardware, until we know it has been fixed.

Ken,
  As for software support for the PDP-10s, our group still exists.  We are now
only 3: Carl Baltrunas, x6206;  Osman Guven, x6236; and Joe Smith, x6220.  Our
manager is Craig Fletcher, x6213.  Best way to reach us is via the secretary
at x6224 and that is the published number to call for software support.  Again
we do not usually deal with customers directly... they should call operations
at their local data center or their customer representative.  There is a group
in IPC or RCS in St. Louis which is supposed to support customers directly.
The contact name I have is Sheldon Rundell.  I don't have his number handy.

/Carl

PS.  About BIONIK... my understanding is that it is a version of the "old"
     BIONIC program before the modifications that I made 2 years ago when
     the new HSA code was put in place.  I really would prefer that NIS
     move their applications (I realize that many of their command sequences
     are burned into ROMs and cannot be changed) by having all new applications
     use the new (SYS) BIONIC program.  It has a KATAKANA command which then
     allows it to do the job that BIONIK was modified to do.  The default is
     ASCII.  We could modify BIONIC to immediatly use KATAKANA mode if the
     user's terminal is in set to KATAKANA, as most of the japanese customers
     are.  I just don't like having multiple versions of programs around to
     be supported when one version can do the job.

Subject: Summary 

Ken,
  I realize that I may not have been clear in summarizing what I said in the
previous memo.

  Basically, if the problems reported by NIS occurred entirely during the
periods when the "broken" base was known to be connected to the spare cpu
while system F74 was running on the spare cpu, then the problems are all
explained by the faulty base hardware.

  If they have other problems and we can reproduce them, we will try to
solve them as they provide sufficient information about reproducing them,
or when they occurred.

  We have seen some BLOCK-IO problems that are similar to those described
in the earlier mail messages, but those were pretty well fixed in recent
(within the last year) changes to the base code or the interface between the
base and TYMCOM-X.  If the character substitution problem continues to occur
we want to be able to reproduce it.

Subject: F26 survived a base reload! 

F26's base was having problems (many jobs running LOGINN in TI state) and
it was reloaded.  Host 26 was not available thru net because the EBUS base
was waiting for the PDP10 to tell it what host number to use.  From KLDCP
I was able to deposit a host-to-base message in the ORING specifying the
host number and 127 ports.  When ORPPDP was poked, host 26 became visible.
OPER could log in, but others couldn't because the base thought the PDP10
was SHUT but F26 thought it had answered.  Setting SCHED 400000 and SCHED 0
cleared up that misconception.  I will add the code to send the right
messages to SCNSER; it may be worth adding a DDT patch to all P035/C when
it's ready.  /Joe

Subject: Formatting X32's disks. 

I found 2 bugs in PAKCOP(PAKCP5).   
If the 1st string controller is off-line (BPA0-BPA7), then PAKCOP assumes
the entire 3674 controller is off-line (BPA0-17 & BPB0-17).  PAKCP5 didnot
want to look at the string of 3650 disks on BPA10-17 as a result of
the string of 3675 disk on BPA0-7 being switched off.

2nd problem: Although I tried to make PAKCOP do everything SA10NW does,
something is missing.  Those paacks have not been formatted using PAKCOP,
because PAKCOP dies on CYL 559 with "Equip Check".    They were formatted with
SA10NW with FMTM=0, wich does cylinders 0-554 only.  When I tried FMTM=1,
SA10NW aborted because cylinders 555-559 were not set up.  I am now using
FMTM=-1 to re-write HA and R0 - this takes 2 secons per cylinder, 19 minutes
per pack.  After SA10NW finished, thhen I reformat thhem in pages.
I plan do do all but BPA16 - I'll leave that one as a test case for the
next version of PAKCOP.			/Joe

Subject: Device not available fixed. 

If you "DO BACKUP" on one job, and "DO PRINT" on a different one, then ti
command "UNLOAD BACKUP:" gets "Device not available - BACKUP".  Therefore I
removed the offending line from BACKUP.MIC.  You shouldn't see the problem
anymore.

As to TOPS-20 documentation, we have some but they are many years out of date.
You should be getting a complete set of Software Notebooks with the 2065
hardware.  I will send a list of suggested manual names later.  /Joe

     Carl, yet another Ontyme sent by NIS Japan.  I note it was sent to
     your FSC ontyme name so I'm forwarding to your TXS name.
 
     Please let me know if the additional data gives you adequate infor-
     mation to follow up further on problem.  Also, do let me know if
     additional specific information is required by you, in order to fol-
     low up on this topic.
 
     I plan to alter your memo of yesterday and send to Japan; primarily
     so they are aware that problem has been, and is being, checked out;
     also to obtain a clarification on the dates of problem.
 
     I'll remove any sections which should not be seen by them and suggest
     that problems of this type be reported to Rick Daniels and myself,
     and that we'll follow up with you as needed (also that Dennis no lon-
     ger works in the Tymcom X group).
 
     Look forward to your comments.  Regards. Ken

Subject   : F74 PROBLEM  
     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
     
Carl and Dennis,    
     
At first, I'm sorry I'm not sure that you are the right person to be contacted  
on such problem. However, in my old memory, you have been the responsible  
persons for PDP-X system software. 
     
The problem on F74 reported during the middle of the last Dec and today, by
many users.    
     
And the problem is becoming very critical.   
     
So please check and advise me, or please pass this letter to appropriate person 
and let me know the name of the responsible person.    
     
The problem is 
     
        When users sent files onto F74 by BIONIC or BIONIK, the modified BIONIC 
        for KANA file input written by ex-Tymshare, they found that some   
        characters (8-12 char string) was replaced as other string.   
     
        For your checking, I located one of the troubled files onto (OGURA:74)  
        CHKDAT.NIS. (The original file in user area is (HAL:74)RHAMK2.020.)
        In that file, you can find a string "WW@@ZZ Z" at 15th column of the    
        307th record. But the original string for the 8 chars is ";  YVWYS",    
        and also we can find the "WW@@ZZ Z" at the 302nd rec in the file.  
        So I guess the 8 char string of 307th rec is overwritten by the 8 char  
        string of 302nd rec.  
     
        Anyway, our users found that the sent files on F74 were different from  
        the original files on their terminals.    
     
        The users tried to send the files through HSA in Japan. And regarding   
        the HSA, no Tymcom-370 user, who access to the host through the HSA
        slot, report such kind of problem.   
     
Thanks and regards, 
Makoto    
     
P.S. I also find some strange matter on creation date in dir information   
     of (OGURA:74)M28250.OTM. Year 1999 was indicated for the creation!!   
     I feel there is something wrong in the current F74.

Ken san,  
     
Thanks for your OnTyme regarding the matter. 
     
I understood what was happened on F74 after the last December. And it explained 
about the status on 22nd Dec 87.   
     
However, one of our user reported the problem on the file which were sent onto  
F74 at 09-Jan-88 JST. ... This is just the case which I mentioned in my last    
OnTyme.   
Also Mr.Nakano made a test file and found the problem at about 15:30 12-Jan-88  
JST by BIONIK with the test file after some trials.    
     
So I think there is still the problem on the current F74.   
     
However, we will wait and coduct the test with the test file on 16t Jan after   
the hardwere return on 15th Jan. Fotunately, 15th Jan is a national holiday in  
Japan. So we, NIS and the customers, have only 1 bussines day by the hardwere   
returning.
     
About the hardwere returnning, please let me know the scheduled time, what time 
on 15th Jan PST, and please notify the time when the returnning take place.
By that information, we may identify the cause of the problem.   
     
Regarding the BIONIK, what Carl mentioned was just correct. In near future,
no user will use the BIONIK.  
     
Best regards,  
Makoto    
P.S. See you in Tokyo the next week !!

Subject: Old base interaction problem 

I was looking at what could be "cleaned up" on some old directories and saw
the following in (TODD)BLKBAL.DOC:

I believe I've discovered the cause of the block i/o 14 sec delay.  It
turns out that the base does not indicate completion of block input
when it receives a Yellow Ball (YB) if it is "busy" at the time.  In
this case it first waits for the host to reflect an Orange Ball (OB).
When I discussed this with Ron Vavier, (the Tymnet person responsible
for mantaining the base code) another problem surfaced which may also
be affecting you.  If the OB is sent back too late (around greater than
3 sec.  after getting the YB) the base will throw it away.  This should
never happen if the monitor is reflecting the OB, but if the user is
doing it, it may happen that the time-out is exceeded either because
the system is heavily loaded or the user delays in returning the OB.  I
believe that this happens regardless of whether block mode is enabled.
Ron Vavier quotes me at least four months for solving the first
problem.  Perhaps if you were to apply pressure from your end the
development cycle could be expedited.  /Todd.


This was dated 25-Mar-81, and may have been worked on as a team of people were
given an award for solving some problem regarding block-io and MAGNUM... anyway
It is worth investigating whether any of the problems mentioned were ever fixed
or are thry still plaguing us today with the NEW base code.

Subject: AJ830 printer driver. 

We have an Anderson Jacobsen daisywheel printer model AJ-830 with a 
Qume Q-30 print mechanism.  I don't believe its escape sequences match
any normal Qume or Diablo printer.  I would like to have a printer driver
for it that will use the superscript and subscript features.

The escape sequences it does understand are:
 4. Reverse LF		<ESC>7
27. Superscript on	<ESC>8
28. Superscript off	<ESC>9
29. Subscript on	<ESC>9
30. Subscript off	<ESC>8
32. Partial line up	<ESC>8
33. Partial line down	<ESC>9
57. Set forms length	<ESC>C066	(for 66 lines per page)
60. Set left margin	<ESC>L
61. Set right margin	<ESC>R
62. Set top margin	<ESC>F		(sets top-of-form at current line)
66. Clear margins	<ESC>M
67. Set horiz tab	<ESC>1
68. Set vert tab	<ESC>5
69. Clear 1 horiz tab	<ESC>2
70. Clear all h tabs	<ESC>E
71. Clear 1 vert tab	<ESC>6
72. Clear all v tabs	<ESC>D

The AJ830 has a wide carriage, does 6 lines per inch only, and can be switched
from 10 to 12 characters per inch only by toggling a mechanical switch.

Is that enough information to build a semicustom printer driver?

Subject: Block I/O problem 

Joe,
  In memory of my previous patch to track down a similar problem with
block i/o, I think it would be a wise idea to install a similar check
in the monitor to verify that the base did indeed write a full/partial
block-i/o buffer and if the base skips a word somehow, do one or more
of the following:
	Issue a black-ball received on port (data lost)
	Issue a new messge type to the base to retransmit the block-i/o buffer
	Error return to the user, cause is data lossage?

I think that there should be some handshake to tell the base that we did NOT
receive the buffer when it sends a message in the ring saying it is done
writing a block-i/o buffer.

Subject: I got an Amiga! 

I don't know if you have heard, but I bought an Amiga 2000.  Nifty colors,
does multitasking, and its video output is compatible with VCRs.

The way tasks talk to each other in AmigaDOS is very similar to another
M68000 system.  See if this sounds familiar:
0) Sender builds a message in its memory.
1) Sender calls routine giving it a pointer to the message.
2) The pointer is put on the linked list on recipient's message port.
3) Recipient gets a signal and/or interrupt that a message is available.
4) Recipient gets message, copies data to its memory, returns message.
5) Pointer to message gets put on original sender's linked list.
6) Original sender is notified.
7) Sender now allowed to free memory allocated to message.

From (CARL)DIRECT I gave the following command:
*PJ.RCF/INDIRECT=(PJ)*.DAT/TMP:ROL:"ROLAID PJ/S"/RUN:DSK:(XEXEC)ROLAID/RUNOFF:1
and ROLAID said "%no option matching /S".  However, it did correctly pick up
the file name.  When I copied the TMPCOR file to disk, it worked.
  */TMP:FOO:"ROLAID PJ/S"/RUN:DSK:(MPL)PIP ;This line given to (CARL)DIRECT
  *009ROL.TMP=TMP:FOO
  *FOO.FOO=009ROL.TMP^Z
  .CTEST RUN (XEXEC)ROLAID

Examining FOO.FOO with FILDDT showed it to be 4 words long.
  "R","O","L","A","I"
  "D"," ","P","J","/"
  "S",nul,nul,nul,nul
  nul,nul,nul,nul,nul

I guess some sort of end-of-line confusion at end-of-file from TMPCOR.

I used Aztec C on a Z-80 system and was pretty impressed.  I've also used
Lattice on a MS-DOS and was not terribly impressed.  But then that's MS-DOS

Subject: P035/D Monitor release .. 
----------------------------------

	This is an announcement of official release of "Monitor Version
P035/D".  Included with this mail is a brief document describing the
significant changes and improvements made to the monitor.

	(SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all PDP-10 systems now have the P035/D
monitor.  This monitor is already tested.  All of Fremont D.C.
PDP-10's have been running with this monitor since December 1, as P035/C10.

	If you need a copy of the Monitor release notes, they are located 
on all of the PDP10s.  They are named as: (OSP)P035D.DOC and (OSP)STOPCD.MEM

	Any questions or comments please call (408)922-6224 and ask for
Carl Baltrunas, Osman Guven or Joe Smith.  Thank you.
(OSP)P035D.DOC - List of changes from P035/C to P035/D.            3-Feb-88
These are the "release notes" for the P035/D monitor.


New messages for the OPR:
  RIBHRE - Hard read error trying to lookup the RIB of a file.
  RIBERR - Software detected error in the RIB of a file.
  REDSAT - Hard read error trying to read a page of the SAT.
  BADSAT - Software detected error in the count of bits in the SAT.
  BADPAG - Hard read or hard write error detected, page gets marked in the BAT.

New UUOs:
  More entries in GETTAB table .GTCNF - see P035D.MEM for details.
  Set KSYS command and UUO give programs warning when the system is
    scheduled to go down.
  Notice-in-Child and inactivity timer added (for XEXEC and SUBMIT jobs).
  SYSDVF function 6 returns named buffers.  (Makes CTYLOG program faster.)
  KS2020 can have up to 8 tape drives defined.  Don't die if no LP20.
  Output event stopcode PTYSBL when a PTY gets a buffer-zap.
  Fixed the problem of "slot out of ports" by no allowing excessive input.
  Monitor edit number stored in GETTAB(70,11) where programs can look at it.
  GETTAB table 130 has date/time job logged in.

Performance enhancements:
  Files are created with contiguous pages if possible.  This speeds up
  sequential access to files (such as TITO saves) and makes BOOTS much
  faster in loading the monitor.

ONCE dialog:
  TYPE BAD will decode the BAT pages and output a list of bad disk pages.
  The date and time must be entered before refreshing the structure.
  The creation date for SAT.SYS and HOME.SYS is the date when refreshed.
  The command to dissolve the structure is spelled correctly (not DISOLVE).
  The front-end file (FEFILE.SYS) on the 2020 is created correctly now.
  TSTSUP commands have been added to allow for patching absolute pages on
    disks.  This disaster recovery procedure has already been used to
    salvage disk problems that would otherwise require a system rebuild.
  A new startup command - NOINITIA - starts DSKCLN but no other part of the
    autorestart procedure.  This was specifically added for TITO rebuilds.

Miscellaneous:
  The date and time defaults from SAT.SYS, so we should never see the
    phony date of 1-JAN-64 ever again.
  The current date/time is now more accurate on KS-2020 systems.
  Stopcode SAXINY has been removed.
  Device errors on 3650 disks are now logged in BAT pages like data errors.
  The EBUS base can be reloaded without reloading the PDP-10.
  Problems with the host/base interface are reported as INFO stopcodes instead
    of DEBUG stopcodes, so that the system will not crash when they occur.

Changes which affect general users:
  The SEND command uses SENDMAIL to send TUMS mail instead of RPG mail.
  The MAIL command now checks for both RPG mail and TUMS mail.

License and privileges:
  The ENABLE and DISABLE commands can set/clear specific licenses.
  A new license has been defined - HR allows home-files read privileges.
  New UUO to allow operators to get all license when doing TITO restore.
  SET AUTOLOGOUT modified to not allow users to disable inactivity timeout.

Hello, again!

     Sorry I took soooooo long responding to your message. The network
address you got from Deanna MacKenn's mother worked out just fine. I'm
not sure just how long it took for your message to travel across the net
but the datestamp on your message seemed to say that it took just one
day.

     Over here in New Jersey on the New Jersey Network PBS station, they
just started to show the first season of the Seventh Doctor Who-Sylvester
McCoy. This station has just completed a long showing of all the available
shows from Doctor #1 through Doctor #6 and now Doctor #7. They show a
complete set of episodes for one show each saturday night. The reason
they are showing Doctor #7 now, is because its pledge drive time for
their station! When I videotape the shows, I always have to add extra
time for about four pledge breaks which come on for about ten minutes
at a time each. I always tape the shows each saturday night and hardly
miss one, so I have a whole lot of tapes lying around that have the
entire run of the series. I'm not sure exactly how many total tapes I
have with just Doctor Who on them! I hate to think how many blank
tapes I've bought ever since I bought a VCR!

     Also on the cable tv here in my area, I can get another station
from Long Island that also shows Doctor Who but in addition to that
it shows the Blakes7 series too! I've got the entire series on about
six videotapes for that and I'm starting another set too as they
rebroadcast them. I don't know if you seen or heard about Blakes7, but
it is based on a group of rebels/criminals struggling to overthrow
the tyranny of the Galactic Federation. They are basically a bunch of
criminal anti-heroes led by a freedom fighter named Roj Blake. They
manage to get control of a very powerful alien starship that lets them
survive all the attacks of the weaker Federation starships. Plus there
are all kinds of other things happening in the show besides that. Anyway,
its another excellent science fiction series from the BBC. You should try
and see it sometime. I was just at a Blakes7 Convention in New Jersey
a month or two ago and it was pretty crowded with fans of the series!
And that's for a show that has been hardly seen over here in the U.S.!
Though, it is being seen more and more during the past year.

     Well, I hope this message manages to make it back across the net
to you! It shouldn't have any problem since yours made it to me though.
Remember my address is: <dringler@ardec>. Oh, yes! Do you use your
computer account to receive the Science Fiction Lover's Digest mailing
list from the network? As soon as I had an account here on the net, I
signed up for it. Now and then there are messages about Doctor Who,
Blakes7 and all kinds of other stuff sent out through that mailing list.
It's really one of the best fun things to do with e-mail! Another
question, how are you accessing the network? Do you use a home computer
to dialup Tymnet into another computer or an account on a computer at
work?

     Be Seeing You....

KTEH channel 54 in San Jose will be showing Sylvester McCoy starting March 17.
They have shown all Dr. Who stories available.  KTEH has shown the "Blake's 7"
series twice, as well as "The Prisoner" twice.

I work for McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company.  The group I'm in used to
be TYMSHARE, the people who invented TYMNET.  McDonnell Douglas bought
TYMSHARE to get cheap hardware maintenance (TYMSHARE's Field Service) and to
get TYMNET.  My job is to maintain the software on the PDP-10's (also known
as KL-10 or DECsystem-10 mainframes).  TYMNET has all of their node code
stored on the PDP-10 systems.  We have to keep the PDP-10s running so that
if a TYMNET node goes down, it can be reloaded from the PDP-10.

"Office-1.ARPA" is a TOPS-20 style system that acts as gateway between
Arpanet and TYMNET.  Because they frown on excessive "junk mail" I have not
signed up for any mailing lists other than AMIGA@Sushi.Stanford.

I have a DEC Rainbow-100 at work (an MS-DOS system that is not IBM compatible),
a DEC VT180 at home (a CP/M system) and just purchased an Amiga-2000.  When I
get an RGB to composite-video adaptor, I plan to re-do my Doctor Who logos in
color.  All of my Dr. Who tapes have 30 seconds of header that has the Dr. Who
logo, the names of the stories on that tape, and the Dr. Who signature tune.

     o  MicroCycles used, for comparison against CPU usage

     o  CPU lost time 0-100%, as determined by the operating system:
	time which the CPU could not run any otherwise runnable jobs due
	waiting for sharable or non-sharable resources

     o  Memory capacity, determined by amount of physical memory on line

     o  Memory availability, determined by usage

     o  Virtual memory (disk space) available, number and type of drives

     o  Disk transfers in blocks (4 blocks = 1 page), includes all page-i/o
	performed on behalf of the user:  direct file i/o, page mapping and
	page swapping done by the system

     o  Disk page mapping:  page mapping and swapping i/o for each job

     o  Terminal activity:  characters input, output and block-transferred

     o  User usage:  Logged-in, active, idle and in disk or terminal i/o wait


  At present, information about TOP CPU users or most accessed programs could
incur a large amount of sampling overhead and additional disk storage to keep
track of the information.  This information can be calculated from data in the
stream accounting files and I feel it would be best to get it from directly
those files.

  Let me know if this is sufficient to start with.  We can add or delete any
additional information that we feel is necessary.

Jnn is the controlling job, Pnn corresponds to TTY254+nn


Job 27 (PTY12=TTY266) had just received the command "ASSIGN DSKD: DSKE:<CR>"
from either BATCON or from MIC (or possibly both at the same time).  SCNSER had
seen the command and echoed it already.  COMCON was looking at the command
and got as far as "SSIGN DSKD: " but couldn't find the rest of the command.
The pointer to "DSKE:<CR>" got zeroed.  My guess is that the master MIC
(job 17) was running on one CPU and BATCON (job 12) was running on another
CPU, and they both tried to stuff commands down the same PTY at the same
time.  I know that DEC fixed several problems in this area when they came
out with 7.02 - this is probably a legitimate RCC stop with a known patch.

The person in charge of maintaining the monitor should look for edits to
SCNSER involving SMP & MIC & BATCH PTYs.

Subject: AR/ARX failures show up as "IME" on current monitor. 

The "IME" stopcodes on system 33 were a result of an AR/ARX parity error
being detected.  I suspect a bad cache board.

.CPUP1+0 = saved contents of UPT+500 = page fail word
.CPUP1+1 = saved contents of UPT+501 = PC at time of page fault
.CP7+0   = saved contents of AC 0 of block 7 (contents of AR)
.CP7+1   = saved contents of AC 1 of block 7 (contents of ARX)
Page fail type 36 is AR parity error (data word from cache or E bus)
Page fail type 37 is ARX parity error (instruction PC points to from cache)

CRA006 was a parity error detected at the S-bus, the sector lights should have
been on for this particular crash.

On all the other crashes, the bad data came from cache and the good data was
read after doing a cache sweep.  The difference in each case is 020000,,000000.

Patch #3 (IMEPAR.PAT) has been applied to NEWMON on all systems in the
data center.  It causes all AR/ARX detected faults to output the standard
"PARITY ERROR" message and then stop with an APRFAT stopcode.

I will look into the possibility of continuing after an AR/ARX error.  /JMS

Subject: B39 base crashes. 

I got your note and agree that you people should be responsible for INIting
B39.  But how long should operations leave B39 down waiting for someone to
look at 2674 via DDT?  I mentioned using INI only if it is necessary to
get B39 back up quickly.

Is it possible to do an up-line dump of node 2674 to ELF or 33 via
gateway?  Right now, I don't think anyone has logged in to 2674 to determine
if slot 1 was stopped due to an ISIS error or a Dispatcher error.

By the way: Although we did generate new code for NW2674, it has never been
loaded.  We had scheduled using the new code, but due to a communications
mixup it was not loaded.  As far as I know, 2674 is running the same code
it always has.

Subject: Analysis of USD crashes. 

I looked at the "USD Adm Sys KL/Tops-10" crashes using FDSYS.EXE.
I looked at IME004.EXE, IME005.EXE, IME006.EXE, and HLT001.EXE.
The only conclusion I can come up with is that the pager is broken or that
the part of the microcode that handles KL pages is not functioning right.

On any crash dump, the contents of UPT+500 thru UPT+503 are copied to the
CDB (Cpu Data Block) at .C0UP1 thru .C0UP1+3.
  .C0UP1+0 is the page fail word.  Bits 0 thru 8 are the page fail code,
    bits 13 thru 35 are the virtual address.  In all the crashes, bit 0
    is off (meaning a reference to Exec virtual address), bit 1 is off
    (meaning page table entry says to cause page fault), and bit 2 is off
    meaning that the "A" bit (access-allowed) is off.
  .C0UP1+1 is the PC flag word.  Zero means exec mode.
  .C0UP1+2 is the 30-bit PC at time of page failure.
  .C0UP1+3 is the 30-bit address of the page fault handler (SEILM).
The current UBR setting can be found in the RH of .C0UP0+3 (which also
shows the current AC block just like DATA0 PAG,UPT+427).  Location .C0SPT
also has a pointer to the UPT.

APRWRS+20/   PUSHJ P,DIE            This is a "warm restart"

My interpretation is that a page fault occurred, and when the KL tried to
set up the PC to jump to the page fault handler, the pager thought it got
another page fault for the routine SEILM at exec virtual address 516300.
This caused another trap to the page fault handler, and it worked the
second time.  SEILM decided this was an Illegal Memory-reference from Exec,
and caused an IME stopcode.  While the stopcode routine was trying to save
all the AC blocks and selected portions of the EPT and UPT, another stopcode
occured, possible due to another page fault.  DIE had incremented .CPDWD from
-1 to 0 on the first stopcode, and from 0 to +1 on the second.  The second
halted the CPU.  Someone tried to restart the CPU, which attempted a warm
restart, but cause another <PUSHJ P,DIE>.  This made .CPDWD = +2 before the
crash was finally saved.

Unless the internal channels caused so much traffic on the Sbus that the
microcode couldn't access the page table, I don't see how these crashes
could be caused by the RH20's.  It looks to me like the pager or microcode
is sick.

Subject: Subtle solution 

After talking with Bill Soley today... we hit upon a solution that lets
MAILER run every 20 minutes (on system 29) and doesn't kick-start polling
our ONTYME mail each time.

  Remove our names from (MAIL:29)ONTYME.DAT
  ...actually modify them to allow sending, but not to poll.

This removes the 1500 logins per month.  To still receive mail, I've
setup a batch job to run once a day at 14:00 to pull our ontyme mail
to FSC.* and TXS.* on system 35.  To do this we run ONTMTP on system
35 once a day, and MAILER knows nothing of this.  ROUTER.DAT is unchanged.

The first pickup will be at 14:00 on Thursday.  The last pickup was at
16:20 on Wednesday.  If once a day is too infrequent, please let me know.
Osman and I agreed that once a day is enough for us.

/Carl

PS.  TXS.C/FLETCHER will still forward to FSC.C/FLETCHER (once a day)
     and FSC.C/FLETCHER will still NOT be polled at all, so whatever
     arrangements you (Craig) have with Karen will continue.

Paul Krumviede (who has a cubicle next to mine in building F) was talking
about upgrading F38's base to the latest version of ISIS and node code.
Something about the old node code being a bottleneck - the maximum amount
of data going thru the base was limited by inefficiencies in node code, not
by the number of sync (or SIO) lines.

Subject: Research on FILAMO/FILAUU 

I wrote 2 quick programs...
  KILLER  - sleeps a second, then does .FORFA for LDBLOG on each frame
  CF      - creates a frame and runs LOGOUT in it

Running both of these programs has produced the following:

  1 crash - (SYS:32)CRA015 [FILAMO] at INSSP2 in FILFND
  2 jobs in CW state - stuck, I believe - both running KILLER

I think the jobs are stuck waiting for the context pages or the ATB for
jobs which have gone away?  Since they shouldn't be waiting for much else
with only 6-9 frames on the system.  When I just run a fresh copy of KILLER
it stays in SL state mostly...  When I startup CF then KILLER prints a $
for each frame it does the .FORFA on that doesn't have JNA set at the time
it does the FRMOP call, but did when it did the SYSDVF call 1 second before.

I will leave them stuck... maybe even start a few more to get stuck to see
the results.  Anyway, a wedged job or a cras is reproduceable!!!!

UPT+501 has PC flags.  0 means all PC flags were off (exec mode).
UPT+502 has 30-bit PC at time of failure.
UPT+503 has 30-bit new PC.

Because .CPUP1+0 and .CPUP1+2 both have SEILM, it means the pager took a
2nd page fault before it executed the first instruction of the page-fault
handler.  The original page fault that started all this was obliterated
by the pager screwing up again.

TOPS-10 uses KL-style paging, which means that the page fault is detected
by the microcode instead of the pager.  I'm not sure who writes into UPT+500,
whether it's the pager hardware or the microcode, but one of them is not
working right.   		/Joe

Subject: EBUS and time 

Joe,
  Ron and I were a bit curious about the simultaneous crashes of the PDP-10s
in Dallas, and noticed that the base on all the machines that were crashed
by the EBUS had been up a bit over 41 days, which is about the resolution of
31 bits of FASTC.  It looks like the half-second logic in the EBUS saw that
FASTC wrapped, and we then got bit by the nature of signed arithmetic on a
68010.  The EBUS decided that a half-second had passed, looked for a key,
etc.  I guess I should change the branch to something other than BLT...
  I hope this resolves the problem.  Ron commented that this was real
familiar.  So we can get about 41 days 10 hours 12 minutes 20 seconds on
a base.

In the following table, the column labeled "CDT" lists when the Dallas
systems received "INFO stopcode BASE" or when they crashed, on 29-Apr-88.
"Reloaded" is when the node first got date/time after reload on 19-Mar-88.
"Host crashed" is when the node marked the host down (time is in GMT).

Paul Krumviede came up with this diagnosis: The "FASTC" clock on the Engine
overflows every 41 days 10 hours 12 minutes 20 seconds.  When this occurs,
the base mistakenly thinks the PDP-10 is not responding and crashes the host.

My diagnosis is that this causes "INFO stopcode BASE" with KEY=0.  In the
process of outputing this message, the PDP-10 dies with an IME stopcode
(or possibly an APRFAT with NXM).

Until new EBUS base code is generated, I suggest reloading the base
at least once a month, while the PDP-10 is down for PM or ASP.

Subject: PDP-10 Monitoring Tool: SYSDAT 

As of monday morning, May 9, 1988 there will be a job logged into (SRA) on
all PDP-10s running the program (SRA)SYSDAT.SAV.  THis job will write a log
file with the name <YY><MM><DD>.MON in directory (SRA) on each system.

This data includes all the system-wide information available at this time
for performance monitoring.  The system is identified in each record which
also contains CPU microcycles, frame, port and memory usage, disk capacity
and free space, user, monitor and swapping/paging i/o rates, base characters
read and written and block-i/o usage.

Please DO NOT log this job out.  It should be running whenever the system is
up for normal timesharing in order to monitor system performance.  At present
a snapshot is taken every 15 minutes and recorded.  (If the sample rate needs
to be adjusted, please let me know and I will change the program.)

I've made an interim fix for the looping mail problem.  The change is in
tymix:/usr/lib/sendmail.cf and it should only impact mail sent to user@uucphost
where uucp is one of antares or niagara.  If we add any new uucp neighbors that
are in the Tymnet "domain" (as regards TUMS) then they need to be added to the
sendmail.cf on tymix under the class "V".  -Bill

Subject: What's in OSP. 

Directory OSP has the production monitor only.  (No patch files, no patched
monitors.)  On each system, OSP has P035D.MEM, P035D.DOC, STOPCD.MEM, and the
appropriate ##035D.SAV file.  A backup copy of ##035D.SAV is also on (OSP:33)
and 33's duplicate is on (OSP:34).

DMON.PAT is in M33 on all systems and has all patches up thru #7 for UFDER1.

The ##035D.SAV file in M33 on all systems was created from (OSP)##035D.SAV
using DMON.PAT.  They have the "###-P035/D-7" monitor.

Example of use:

System 37 added a second string of 3652 disks in March.  
1) Edit (M33:33)CONF37.MAC to add 2nd string, then "CPY CONF37.MAC/HOST:32".
2) GFD to OSP and run MONED1 there to create a new 37035D.SAV
3) TELECOPY from (OSP:33)37035D.SAV to (OSP:37)37035D.SAV
4) Login to 37 and apply DMON patches:
   GET (OSP)37035D
   DDT
   ^Y (M33)DMON.PAT
   SAVE (M33)37035D

To repeat: OSP has the virgin, unpatched monitor.  M33 has patches.

They have put in long hours to provide updated software for the
conversion of these systems from MEMOREX disk drives 3675's to 3650's
and 3652's; from BLOCK monitor to PAGE monitor; updated disk recovery
software; and numerous other software changes to improve the 
availability of these system for our customers.

As I seem to like to dredge up ancient history in this forum, these
thoughts sent me to my dusty closet of 'olde stuff' to fetch volume
1 (I also have V2) of a collection of papers produced by DEC called
"PDP-10 Applications in Science".
I think that I got this sometime in 1970, though most of the papers
seem to be from around 1967-1968.
The third paper in the book is

"Selecting and Evaluating a Medium Scale Computer System"
"A Study Undertaken for Louisiana State University at New Orleans"
by Jon A. Stewart, Director, LSUNO Computer Research Center

The paper is a summary of an in-depth comparison of three major
systems of the time; the SDS Sigma-5, the IBM 360/44, and the
DEC PDP-10. The paper is very fine at bringing back the memories
of the good old days, but of most interest to this discussion is
an appendix containing compiler-generated code for a simple
fortran benchmark.

The upshot was that the PDP-10 generated much shorter code,
that also ran faster. (I can publish a sample if there is
enough interest.)

While this paper drew no architectural conclusions (such as
are discussed in this forum) the main reason (if I
remember my DEC Propaganda of the day) was the very orthogonal
instruction set as opposed to a smaller number of instructions.

This clean and complete instruction set allowed the compiler
to use a large percentage of the instruction set. While I believe
that the clean instruction set came first, and the compiler
that used the large percentage of that instruction set came later,
rather than the current risc idea of profiling code to determine what
will be in the instruction set, it was a haunting hint of where
we would be today.

I recall seeing published statements about how many of the KA-10's
366 instructions were actually used by the FORTRAN compiler.
Does anyone still have these numbers??

I also have some DEC Propaganda from about 1973 bragging about
the optimization done by DEC FORTRAN. This includes examples
of generated code. Again, if anyone is interested...

SUBJECT>   Checking NODE CODE Loads


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


On the TYMCOM-10's there is a utility  that identifies date and time,
slot, user and directory that a specified  file(s) was accessed on the
TYMCOM-10 currently logged into.

For example, I want to know when anyone loaded node or slot code for 
node 2430.  The output of this request and the full session is listed below.
The program is FIND.SAV.  To execute it, you must log into the system
you suspect the code was loaded from.  The code and documentation is located
in the SPL directory.

The following is the node 2430 session example:

R (SPL)FIND

Target 1:  2430.      For all occurrances of "2430." in my specified file.
                      Be sure to put a 'period' after the number.

Target 2: <cr>        At this point, more search strings could be entered
                      but this is all I'm interested in.  Also, rather than
                      2430 as a string, I entered 2430. to capture all
                      occurrances of ##2430.* and also avoid capturing
                      other loads that happened to be done where the time
                                                                Page  2

                      stamp had the string 2430 in it.

search in: .R         This is where all commands are entered.  ".R" to
                      file all lines containing "2430." in them.

Recording file: RICK.TMP      This is my file name.

search in: (SYS)LOADII.ACC     Search for "2430." in file (SYS)LOADII.ACC.

(SYS)LOADII.ACC: 1 (14)       Target 1 found 14 times.

search in: .Q         At this point, more command could be entered like ".T"
                      to enter new targets, etc.  ".Q" entered to close
                      file RICK.TMP and end the session.

The following is the file RICK.TMP and the format is the following:

File name that was searched:

DATE ! START TIME ! STOP-TIME ! ? ! SLOT ! LOADII-CMD ! SUCCESS !
USERNAME ! FILE-NAME ! NEIGHBOR ! LINE-# ! NETWORD ! ? ! ? !TARGET #) !
"STRING" ! # OF MATCHES

***********************************************************************

(SYS)LOADII.ACC

(PAGE 1)...
110485 155656 16 1 1        LD OK OPER  (TYMNET)ND2430.`BND 2355 1

************************************************************************

To obtain the above file, enter TYP RICK.TMP on terminal.

This could be useful for resolving erroneous code load problems, etc,
and can be tailored by inputing the appropriate search string.

This only lets you know if the code was loaded from the right directory
with the correct filename.  It does not tell you what version was loaded.

The output on the CTTY when the code is loaded should report the current
version loaded.

Thanks Rick Daniels

Subject: NETID on CREAUX. 

I have modified SCNSER to pick up bits 1 thru 16 from the LH of the AC used
in the CREAUX uuo.  (Bit 17 means don't zap on reset, bit 0 is unused).
ThThe message that requests permission to build an AUX circuit now has:
  1st byte = 16 hex (26 octal) = Supervisor request
  2nd byte = port number if job has a command port, 0 if detached
  3rd byte = bits 1-8 from AC used in CREAUX uuo
  4th byte = bits 9-16 from AC used in CREAUX uuo.

The EBUS can pick up these two new bytes by defining AUXNETID as a word of
storage and adding MOVE.W DAT3,AUXNETID at label SUPR1 in routine SUPREC.
If the AUXNETID is zero, the EBUS should send ISIS port-0 message 8 to the
node code where the port originated.  That message is:
  1st + 2nd byte = 0 = port 0 message
  3rd byte = 8 = aux circuit request
  4th byte = key = meaningful to dispatcher only (maybe we can use this)
  5th byte = high half of local key, always zero for EBUS
  6th byte = low half of local key = port number from PDP-10
  7th + 8th byte = flag bits, including IIX (maybe we can use 8th byte)
  9th byte = high half of origination host, always zero for EBUS
  10th byte = low half of origination host number = PDP10's host number
  11th byte = size of string to follow
  12th and following bytes = USERNAME:HOST

Next question: Where do we put the extra info into message 8?  Or would it
be better to define a new port-0 message?  Do we want 8 bits of NETID or 16?

These changes are in P035/D07.		/Joe

Joe,
  I think we should define a new message so that maybe things will work with
mismatched code.
  The node-code uses a 16 bit field for NETID, but I'm not sure how many new
nets will want to have this done... We currently don't even require 8 bits for
NETID.
  You suggested sending aux crq requests to the originating node-code for the
port if the AUXNETID is zero.  Is the port send from the monitor to the EBUS
as part of the aux circuit request the ISIS port number for the command port?
Is it possible that one could get a zero AUXNETID and a zero port number?  We
may have to define a default NETID (I guess whatever is in slot 0?) to cover
this case...

I'm not sure what all went into the changes to DTELDR.  I think the best bet
would be to ask Ted Atkinson about it.  (The people running the St. Louis KL
should be able to tell you how to get ahold of Ted.)  It might be as simple

Just before the conversion, F33 was almost 100% full on 24 units.
Formatting in pages allows for 7 pages per track instead of 25 blocks per
track.  (7 pages = 28 blocks.)  The ratio of 28 to 25 is 1.12 = +12 %.
This makes 24 logical units in pages the equivalent of 26.88 block units.
The added 2.88 units at 103500 pages per makes for about 298000 pages free.

F33 now has 288270 pages free.  It's a lot better than the low of 14697 pages
it got down to on 30-Jun.				/Joe

It looks like DOM means "Don't Own MM resource".  This is an SMP software
problem, where one CPU goes to finish up on a UUO and another CPU has already
completed the request.  This is the type of problem where the local systems
programmer is expected to save the crash and SYSTEM.SAV and send them to

Am I presuming too much in saying we will pool the knowledge from all three

anyone other than Craig could be added; Craig is good at pulling information
out of all of us in a directive manner;  For planned response/repair there

Tracking down MM interlock problems on an SMP system is very nasty.
I looked at it, and found nothing obvious.  My guess is that it will take
over a week of solid looking to find the problem, which will undoubtedly
require a change to the software to fix.  As I understand it, this would
exceed the amount of software support we have promised (if any) to this

Subject: EBUS 

Joe,
  I just got a copy of an ISIS NSR requesting that ISIS include a crash type
in the crash message sent to the EBUS board from the engine when the EBUS
slot crashes.  I guess that the EBUS is then supposed to pass this to the
monitor so that it can tell why the slot crashed.  My question is simple:
does anybody really care?  One can get the information from the base, but
time-stamps might not be well matched.
  I couldn't find any indication of a problem with F29's base other than
a history of power fails, caused by some operator initializing the node.
It might have taken a micro-code halt, but we would need the PSW from the
engine console to guess what went wrong.  Another possibility is that the
kernel hung in a loop.  Once again, we need the PSW.

In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 8 Aug 88 16:27:16 PDT

Yes, we would want to see this information, where the PDP-10 reports a code
saying why the EBUS slot has crashed.  It would give operations a head
start in determining what needs to be done to get the EBUS back on line.

The PDP-10 checks the leftmost 16 bits of the KEY whenever location 30 is
nonzero.  It takes a crash dump if that value is 004 (indication the we
send an illegal message type), but outputs the value in octal and continues
if it is anything but 004.  If you want to put more information into the KEY
when the EBUS is halted, SCNSER can handle it.

We (the TYMCOM-X Support Group) are planning to have a new source release
of the EBUS code in the near future.  This added info is worth adding to
the release.

As everyone is aware of, or has heard, ASP can be used to copy
out a unit, or units, on the TYMCOM-10's.

ASP is only used if PACKCOPY cannot be used, or if it fails to
copy out a unit - it is not a general procedure to use instead
of PACKCOPY.

If not done correctly, a system can be wiped out.

It is requested that Shift Supervisors get together and let

of these procedures.  Please submit a joint schedule to me by
19 August.

All other interested personnel are invited.

Subject: Average and max chars per second thru the base? 

A question came up while talking with Krumviede: what is the limiting factor
in getting characters into and out of the PDP-10s?  Is it:
 a) the number of characters SCNSER can handle,
 b) the speed in which the 68000 shuffles data from PDP-10 to Engine memory,
 c) the Dispatcher moving data to/from slot 1 and node code,
 d) the thruput of node code talking to the switchers.

The IRING size of 128 words and ORING of 256 means a maximum of 500 in
and 1000 out per tick, or 30K cps in and 60K cps out.  This does not
count block-I/O, but I'm sure that UUOCON can't provide that much
thruput on non-block-I/O lines.  Node code on D25's and D54's bases
reported an average of 700 in/out (at the time we were watching) and a
high-water mark of around 6800 characters per second in and out.

Carl: Did you determine that JBTCNI/JBTCNO was valid or bogus?  I looked at
a couple of systems (including F33-P035/D-7) and noticed that JBTCIN+0 and
JBTCOT+0 were between 1.0 and 2.0 times UPTIME.  That is, an average of 1
character per tick = 60 per second over a 131 hour period.

The question that started this discussion was "would enabling the trace buffers
in the 68000 code slow down thruput?"

The question itself is not as important as the fact that the metrics are not
available.

Subject: Average/max chars per sec base<==>PDP-10 

At 30 chars/msg = 8 words/msg gives 16 msgs in and 32 msgs out for a more
precise character count of 480 in and 960 out per tick (60th second).  If
the base keeps up with 1/60th second response, the total would be 28,800 in
and 57,600 out cps.  However, I do not know how fast the base polls the ring.
(This is important, since it checks the key each 1/2 second...)

On the KL, we can easily change the size of the ring on a heavily loaded
system to determine if SCNSER is the bottleneck.  The rings can be any size
we want as long as it's a power of 2.  (I'd like to see 1-page or 1K RINGS
for such a test.)  I had done this once, at the time we found the bug in
the KMC code for the 2020.

JBTCNI and JBTCNO are valid and presumed accurate not counting block-io which
is found in JBTBIO  (see (CARL:33)SYSDAT.SAI for actual table if JBTBIO is not
correct).  We do have sampling of the data you request every fifteen minutes
for all systems that ran SYSDAT since the beginnig of June-88.

I think you are right... the real bottleneck may be UUOCON and not SCNSER for
normal I/O.  If you'd like, I can finish whipping up my SHOVEL program to do
just that... shovel data through the interface, using regular I/O, TTCALLS, and
BLOCK-IO or even all three to determine the maximum rate.  (TTCALLS would use
things like OUTSTR/OUTPTR or .AXPTR/.AXSTR).

What did you guys decide?

Well, we used to be able to set the size to anything we wanted as I mentioned.
Will this mess up anything that you've done with saving a copy of the rings at
crash time? or in allocating space to hold the copy of the rings?

If not, then just changing the right pointers, it's done!

Subject: EBUS bases 

Joe,
  A program to find and count buffer zaps in the public net showed
that D54's base had about 11,000 buffer zaps in the first two weeks
of August.  They all appear to have been rebuild buffers, so it is
unlikely that any real data was lost, but it might be a good idea
to increase the slot 0 memory allocation by about 100k (or more).
It might be reasonable to do this for all the bases...
  Is it time to copy the files onto TYMNET/TYM5?  Sandra Nilluka
was trying to investigate the buffer zap reports and wasn't aware
of the EBUS directory, and I suspect she isn't the only lost soul.

Hi Joe. I put in the suggestion you gave me to prevent run away job

run every hour and some on the half hour. Each of  those  jobs puts
itself in to run one time. So, if you have a job that runs only once and
puts inself in right before it does anything else, you  should
never see it  in the queue more than once. As I said, I7ve used your suggestion to prevent the problem, but I don't agree with your reasoning behind why I

Subject: AUXMOX overloading of F33 to end in a couple of days. 

I talked to Phillipe Michel in Project Implementation about the many jobs
running AUXMOX.  The "522 Deployment Project" is modifying the TYM and
CMD files of all nodes in the Public Net to use Node Code version 5.22.
The BND files are being telecopied from D25/D54 to F33 as they are
created, because many nodes are reloaded the same night as when their
code is generated.  The people in PI did not know that you could enter
more than one file specification at a time when running (SPL)COPY.
Therefore each node was transfered as a seperate TELECO job.

Phillipe said they should be done in a few days.     /Joe

Subject: TYM files for all EBUS bases updated. 

The TYM files have been updated to include features that will help the
REBUILD option.  The new base code is now in (TYMNET:25)ND####.BND and
(TYM5:54)ND####.BND.  Please use them instead of the NW####.BND files the
next time the base is reloaded.

In each TYM file, the symbol REBTST is defined so that OPTION(REBLD) works
right and S0CORE has been bumped up from 240 to 350 to make more room for
the rebuild buffers.

The old BND files have been renamed to BK####.BND on (TYMNET:25) and on
(TYM5:54).

Subject: Need mail alias program on PDP-10s. 

I have added /GATEWAY to SMTPX.  This allows a line such as
	TRW [*] SMTPX *.Q/DEL/HOST:633/GATEWAY
which means that when TRW.Q is present, SMTPX will use "MAIL:633" to create
the aux circuit to the TRWNET gateway, then use "MAIL" once there (which is
homed to their 2020).  I have verified that this will get TRW.Q to their
system.

Now we need a program to mung on the RCPT to lines.  It needs to be given 2
arguments; the name of the file to convert, and the string to substitute
in place of the string after "@" in all RCPT lines.  This would allow the
translation of <JMS@930> to <JMS@17> and <JMS@TRW> to <JMS@S33>.
(If you type SYSNO on TRW's monitor, it says S33-P034/P-10.)

Either that, or a way to tell SMTP how to recognize an alias when the
data is being received.

Subject: re: .chCFP and VCREAT 

I was thinking....

  If we had a new bit in RIB pointers (near RBREAL et al) that said that
this page is a virgin page that HAS NOT been zeroed on disk.  Then, .chCFP
could be speeded up by simply assigning pages to a file.  When a page is
mapped in (by whatever means) with this bit set in the RIB, the data on
DSK is ignored and the user is given a free memory page assigned to the
disk page.  Only after the new page has been written to disk is the entry
in the RIB modified to reflect that the data is good!

  Likewise, for super-map/virgin we simply assign a clean memory page to
the appropriate disk page and set the page-dirty bit so it will be written
out reasonably soon.  ASP would then be speeded up by not using such a large
page cache for writing (not having to wait for it to come in)...

  For .chCFP, all pages created with .chCFP could use this bit and the user
would NOT pay the penalty of having to wait twice (once while it is zeroed
and written, and again to have it mapped).  This also would remove the NEED
for create-zero-map page, since allocation and mapping would be as though
a VCREATE was done, (allocation - finding free pages in the SAT, mapping -
assigning a free memory page).

  If you also add your super-map "retrieval-pointer"-page then if this new
"virgin" bit is set in the retrieval pointer, the page is allocated from
clean (zeroed) memory and assigned to whatever page the ret-pointer was
pointed at.   This could helf DSKCLN and otehrs a lot.

Think about it and comment...

Hmmmm...

  What if when I open the file on output, I do .CHCFP for one more page
than I actually need... this will produce a file of contiguous pages with
the pattern n+1,n+2,....,n+m,n.   Then, I truncate the file to the proper
word length, thus deleting page n, and leaving a one-page orphan that won't
be contiguous in any file (most likely).

  I can check the .chCFP result for errors and if I get "no room" then I
simply release the channel freeing up the pages and print the appropriate
message on the console, can't enter file.. No use writing the file up to a
point before finding out it won't fit.

Just a note... it will have to be done the right way, that is, writing

Subject: re: SPAGES.SYS writing 

Joe,
  There is "sort of" a way to get the page information for SPAGES.SYS
without without too much trouble...

  VDSKPT AC,    ; where ac/ memory page

  First, we lookup SPAGES.SYS to get the size.
  Then we do a DSKCHR on the STR to get the # pages in STR and each UNIT.
  The number of units is deduceable from the DSKCHR info.
  The size of SPAGES div #-UNITS = 2 times pages per cylinder and gives
      the offset into SPAGES per unit.
  This offset div 2 = Max pages we want to write per unit, thereby only
      using 1 cylinder of the 2 on each unit that SPAGES uses.
  Then we do CHANIO .chMFP each of the pages we wish to scribble in
      for safety's sake (and we do want to compare info later).
  Now that it's mapped, we use VDSKPT to get the retrieval pointer on disk
      for each page "before" we overwrite it.
  To overwrite it, we take the retrieval pointer, calculate the appropriate
      structure page that matches the <UNIT>B16+<PAGE> and super-map that
      page read/write and then scribble in it and unmap both pages.

**This is still much less work than deciphering rib data structures in a
  user program, and depending on things that ONLY the monitor and DSKCLN
  ought to know in the first place!

Craig,
  What this means is that writing SPAGES is simple and straight-forward and
the extra steps taken here will provide greater reliability that QIKSAV will
NOT damage anything on the disk.  If SPAGES doesn't exist, it will report it
as such and maybe write a disk file, but won't just go scribbling on various
unknown cylinders, corrupting the file system in an effor to save it.

I have the map from disk and write to tape portion of TITO working, tested

(SYS)TITO of all tapes written with both versions of TITO.

On system 33, with a minimal load (not a controlled single user environment)
Saving (SYS)*.* took 20 minutes with TITO
                took  8 minutes with TITO-P

On system 32, with the static sys-jobs (again not completely controlled)
Saving ALL (for 1 tape) took 52 minutes with TITO
                        took 18 minutes with TITO-P
                        took 17 minutes with TITO-P (minor change to loop)

All times are approximate... within one-minute.

TITO-P is approximately 3 times faster than TITO.

Subject: Memory utilization of the Dallas PDP-10s 

I ran Carl's SYSSHO program on all the machines in Dallas and checked the
memory utilization over the past 24 hours.  The results are:

System Memory  Low High  Comments
D23    2 meg   70% 600%  could use 4 meg, CPU is only 50% utilized
D25    2 meg   50% 100%  OK                 (Public Net code generation)
D31    2 meg   25%  40%  OK
D34    2 meg   90% 150%  OK, CPU usage is about 30%
D35    2 meg   20%  30%  OK
D37    4 meg   20%  30%  could run on 2 meg
D54    4 meg   20%  50%  could run on 3 meg (Public Net code generation)
D55    4 meg   30%  40%  could run on 2 meg
D56    4 meg   90% 170%  was 180% to 350% before upgrading from 2 to 4 meg

Please remember that these percentages were obtained by looking at the systems
for only one day.  Weekly or Monthly activities could use up more system
resources.  It may be worth considerring moving 2 meg from D37 to D23.
This move is not as urgent as adding 2 meg to D56 was, because D23 appears
to be running large but mostly inactive jobs.

D56 has been saturated at 100% CPU utilization all day today since 6:34am CDT.
It really needed the extra memory.

Subject: How to get a good crash dump 

Use the following procedure to get a good crash dump when the KS2020 is not
responding.  

  1) Get to the KS10> prompt by typing Control-\ (on some terminals, you have
     to type Control-` or Control-M).

  2) Type SHUT.  It will respond with "KS10>USR MOD".

  3) The system should go to BOOTS.  If it does not respond within 30 seconds,
     get back to the KS10> prompt.

  4) Type HALT.  It will respond with either %HLTD or ?DNC.

  5) Type SM.  It will respond with %HLTD/000000 PC/000000,,000000.

  6) Type ST 147.  It should type "Manual restart from 147" and go to BOOTS.

  7) If step 6 fails, go to the KS2020 control panel (the one with 3 white
     switches and 4 lights), and press RESET then BOOT.  (Note: the white
     switch marked LOCK must be in the OFF position for this to work.)

Once BOOTS is loaded, it may do a "/D" automatically.   If you see the
"BOOTS:" prompt without the "/D", then type /D and hit the RETURN key to get
a crash dump.  After about 30 seconds BOOTS will prompt again.  Reload the
system.  After the system is up, send mail to JMS,OSMAN,CARL.  Be sure to
mention whether you had to type "HALT", "SM", "ST 147", or press RESET.
Also include the name of the file that COPYCR prints on the CTY.

FINE on the TYMCOM-X systems on the tape.  I changed a few of the key bindings
to reflect the bindings of the current VUE, and put it on SYS as VUE.EXE.

To run it:

    .R VUE;filename                   where filename is the file to edit


The only complications are with ^S through TYMNET.  ^S^S^Q works in-place of
any single ^S as needed.  I also added ^XS as a binding = ^X^S just for ease.
Help is ^X?  and mind you this is an OLD OLD version of VUE.  Many features
do not work (eg. $X function doesn't work)

Joe:  I have SED and other things on the tape if you want to install them.
      I onl;y put up VUE so I can work 3-5x faster on things than I can using
      TECO or SOS.

Joe,
  I put some of the things from my tape on PUSH:[1,2,*] including 2 versions
of SED (POssibly the same version? I didn't look) in [1,2,sed] and [1,2,sed,nih]
fo you to look over.

  PUSH:[1,2,SYS] has the system files from GALLAUDET, with many of the .EXE
files for FUR and other goodies.  Feel free to transfer any of these to SYS:
if you want to use them.

  We found out that somebody in FSC was using DDT on node 2021 to acquire

Subject: X32 Mail host 

Hi gang,

  Two problems have come to mind in regards to using system X32 as a
mail host (other than the obvious: what to do when it's being used as the
spare hardware for some other system)...

  1)  mail names will be limited to 12 characters
      R/Williamson  works fine = 12 chars
      C/Longfeathers  is a couple of characters long = 14 chars

  2)  TUMS currently relies on "user/filename" for archive files, lists,
      exec files and other special things.  Thus, C/BALTRUNAS looks for
      (C)BALTRU.TUM

      We could hack TUMS to get around this, but it may not be worthwhile
      since it would break the features it relies upon.
      This means we'd have to look at a different way to specify names and
      that means re-training people.

Joe,
  DO you have any idea what kind of problems people were having?  Version
3.00 is supposed to fix a problem with 5 digit kernel hosts (2.16 had a
I4 format image), but I don't know what else changed.  I don't know who
installed it, but it supposedly worked in tests on B39.  STS has some silly
idea about a missing 1022 data-base file called LOADII.ACC, which isn't
a 1022 file at all.

thanks,
paul

George King said that it built the circuit to the gateway, then hung.  When he
hit the ESC key, it output its "LOADII interrupted at PC" and hung again.
He couldn't get out of LOADII.  Debbie Hightower at the Fremont Datacenter
(415/498-2588) called us for help.  She should know more about the complaints.

  I talked to Don Murtaugh, who added a hack to record load statistics in a
1022 data-base (SYS)LOADII.DMS.  It appears that escaping out of it damages
the data-base, and it can't recover.  I guess somebody is having problems
with Bubbnet loads off of 25 also.
  Ron Saltgaver has a program to install things like LOADII and NAD that uses
SSINSTALL.  Don Murtaugh is going to hack the data-base stuff and re-install
LOADII (over our objections).  Don't know more... Don was going to call
Debbie.  Looks like a few ill-advised changes screwed things up real well.
  We were wondering if any other systems had problems, but I guess we will
wait and see.
  Can somebody look at the XEXEC job on D34?  It seems to be hung...

Subject: Correlation between RCCDBG stopcode and EXECX:"Lost command port" 

There are 3 problems I want to make you all aware of:
1) SUBMIT jobs abort for no apparent reason; EXECX says that it lost the
   command port of the currently running job.
2) (MPL)TTYTAB sometimes reports PTYs that are "zapped" and "gone" but one
   half of the pair is still marked as being in-use.
3) The TTY buffers get messed up which cause IME stopcodes on monitors prior
   to P035/D08.  They get reported as INFO stopcode RCCDBG in new monitor.

The following evidence indicates that the 3 problems may be related:

Carl: I recommend a quick hack to EXECX to make it output a message on the

Subject: NONAME bugged by SIMPL compiler 

There is a new NONAME on F29 which will be propagated to SYS on all systems
if it lasts a week with no problems.  It fixes a *BUG* in all known versions
of code caused by the compiler.  (Or lack of understanding by the author,
[not me]).

        HW(DUL(1),1)     Generated  HRRZ ac,@DBLK(ix)
                         instead of HRRZ ac,DBLK(ix)

I tried a couple of things and finally changed the code to a byte field
instead of a half-word field and it works fine.   The HW construct is used
all over, and only in this one instance did I see the bad code.  {Sigh}!

Problems like this are hard to find, the source code looks good!

Subject: TRW 

Joe, Osman:
  Craig and I were talking about the revised memo from Healy about TRW
and that they do NOT really have anyone looking out for their interest.
For example, no one in particular is interested in making sure that they
get what they need as far as multiple lines on their LSI, or upgrade to
11/23, etc...

  I mentioned that we once discussed (in terms of multiple networks in
the same node seeing the same host) having TRW use a KL-10 or have direct
access to one.

  I went on to conjecture...  What about attempting to solve their real
problem?  Which I perceive to be growth...  they need more processing
power from their 2020 and they need more connectivity to the network to
be able to load nodes faster...

  Are they asking for anything else?

Why not propose that TRW take over system 29 or system 55 (or both) as
they are decommissioned from TYMNET.  Leave them on site in Fremont or
Dallas (multi-region access?) and let IPC continue to run them.  Then
have TRW obtain leased lines to the data center(s) and connect the bases
to TRWNET directly.  At their option, they may rent or place their own
engines in the data center...  [maybe even their SUPs?] ...Letting IPC
or (TYMNET, if they decide to take over the data centers) handle the day
to day operations.  FSCO already does their maintenance and of course, we
could maintain a PDP-10 a lot easier in the data center.

  Just as System 39 is on BUBB-NET, they could put 29/55 in TRW-NET and
we could maintain them just as we maintain 39.

  Of course, this is simply an interim solution, until NSC releases their
products on SUN or other UNIX-based systems.  Just because TYMNET is moving
off the PDP-10s, what is to say certain private-net customers such as TRW
or SouthWestern-Bell might not be interested in direct network access for
their large-area nets?

/Carl              Think about it...  let me know if you know who we ought
                   to discuss this with in NSC.  Especially since they do

It looks like NDT has no plans for supporting the ATC or microtymbase from
the Sun systems. To make sure that we can still re-gen the code to our micronet,
I have duplicated NEW11, CURR11, OLD11, DOC11, and TOOLS11 from B39
to F33 and X17.  I have also located the config files for the French 2020's
(S59, S83, S263), Ranier Bank (W1051), Fayez-Sarofim (H370), and TRW.
This way, even if B39 goes away, we should be self-sufficient.   /Joe

Does anyone know of a UNIX utility that will read tapes made with the
the TOPS-20 DUMPER utility. A new faculty member here has several tapes 
written with both the DUMPER utility and the TOPS-10 BACKUP utility. He 
now wishes to read them onto a UNIX machine. Having never been a TOPS-20
installation, we have never had to deal with such a conversion before. Most
of the tapes are many years old, so having them rewritten in a more 
compatible format is not an option.

Alternately, a utility to read such tapes onto a CDC Cyber (running NOS) or 
IBM VM System would do. A a last resort, finding a TOPS-20 site, with Internet 
access, willing to read the tape for us would do.

Subject: Available memory for slots in X32's base. 

Memory requirements of the PDP-10 bases.

The current set of BND files use 809k of core.  Only 215k bytes are unused.

Node code requires a minimum of 235k, anything above that amount is used for
buffers (needed by the REBUILD option).  All the TYM files have S0CORE
to 350k.  (B39 had problems with rebuilding circuits with less than 300set

The EBUS code in slot 1 needs only 10k, but an additional 256k is allocated
if the option EBDUMP is selected.  This memory is for dumping the 68K's
memory into the Engine to analyze crash dumps.  Nobody uses this option.

Slot 2 had 100k allocated, but needs only 10k for storing the 68K code.

I juggled the memory configurations around, and came up with the following:

Slot  Low  High Core  Use
FF  00000 177FF  93k  Kernel (DDT host 1294)
 0  17800 55FFF 250k  Node Code (XRAY host 1294)
 1  56000 587FF  10k  EBUS, host 32
 2  58800 5C7FF  16k  68000 code for EBUS
 3  5C800 617FF  20k  Slot for Joe, host 24
 4  61800 667FF  20k  Slot for Carl, host 28
 5  66800 6B7FF  20k  Slot for Osman, host 57
 6  6B800 F07FF 532k  Big slot, host 930 (512k of buffer)
    F0800 FFFFF       unused

Joe I was recently in Houston Texas for a KI10 system problem which is running
701a Tops-10.The system crashed as user job with a ILM stopcode.The job that
crashed was running OPR ver 4(412) and the GLXLIB version is 1(1143) and we
got a GLXLIB error 23.We reloaded the system and had no further problems,the
job ,OPR,was crashed when the operator typed "TAKE SYSTEM" at the OPR
prompt.Could you tell me if this is a software problem or not,I have the
printout with the AC's if you need any more information.

Thank You

GLXLIB problems are always software problems.  They are caused by:
1. The program (such as OPR.EXE) gets corrupted.
2. The library GLXLIB.EXE gets corrupted.
3. The system queue file in an inconsistant state.
4. The monitor gets confused with too much IPCF page shuffling going on.

If there are no disk read errors or RIB errors and the problem goes away
when the system is reloaded, then it was probably #4.  I know 7.01A had
some problems when IPCF traffic is very heavy.

The line to neighbor node 5416 is suspended because that node has no XLINKs

Subject: Analysis of TRW's MAPAL1 crash. 

LOGINN was running and did an INBUF uuo which caused the low-seg to be
expanded to handle the input buffers.  The kernel did a VCREAT uuo, asking
for 2 writeable pages starting at user virtual page 2.  One page was
allocated and a second one contiguous to the first was requested.  The
MAPAL1 occured when PCBIO was asked to read a bogus SAT page for SWAMP.

Something went wrong in GETPAG while allocating the first page.  It returned
200004,,467125 which is an error; the highest page on an RP06 is 227161 octal.
The bogus disk address was found in ac M and in the UPT and UPT+UPTLMA.
When GETPAG was called the second time, is took the bogus disk address,
calculated the address where the STT would be if the disk had that many
pages, and read random garbage as an STT entry.  It read this garbage as
if it were a retreival pointer and passed it on to PCBIO.  The MAPAL1 crash
is a result of RBREAL not being set on this garbage pointer.

There was no bounds checking in the GETSTT routine in SWAMP.  I put in a
check against UNIPAG.  This will fix this particular MAPAL1 scenario but
until the problem in GETPAG is found, bad data can still get put into the
UPT.  That will cause a PAGPOR (page out of range) stopcode when the page
is faulted in.

I have not checked the logic in GETPAG to find out why it could return a
bogus value.  It may have been that the very last SAT page of the last
unit was in-core and completely full (and the routine fell off the end
of DSKB).			/Joe

Subject: re: TOPS-10 FIle being modified (3) 

Joe,
  I setup FACT.CTL to submit FCTLOG.CTL for /after:+0:05 just before it
finishes.  FCTLOG.CTL simpley renames FACT?.LOG to FACTn.LOG where n is
increased each time it runs, making FACT.LOG ==> FACT1.LOG.

  Well, normally I'd expect this to work... but it doesn't.  It gets the
file being modified error.

  Background:  I foolishly [?] tried having this rename occur while inside
FACT.CTL and (of course, received FIle being modified (3) as the error).
This was earlier this afternoon.  I created FOO.CTL and submitted it as:
  SUBMIT FACT=FOO.CTL/...     then
  SUBMIT FACT/TIME:10:00/UNIQUE:0/AFTER:3:00   to run tonight...

Anyway, I just logged in and FCTLOG ran 5 minutes after FACT completed and
still got the File being modified error.  I tried it by hand, nearly an hour
after BATCON finished running FACT and I got the File being modified error.

Who has the file open?  Why?  Is this a bug in 7.01?

me to check, otherwise I'd just have BATCON delete it after printing.
I don't want to print an ever-increasing FACT.LOG every day, but I do
want to print it every day for their benefit!

TRW is upgrading their microTYMbase from an 11/03 to an 11/23 CPU.  They
need a PDP-11 "backplane"; a BA-11/NE chassis.  Ed Roop says they are zero
book value.  Each Augment system has a microTYMbase in the I/O rack, just
below the tape drive.  (I borrowed one chassis to hook up to our 2020 for
testing purposes.)

John Healy is supposed to install it in Anaheim - we need to ask him
whether he wants it shipped to Steve Ellerbusch or transport it himself.

At 00:05 I tried to TAUX to XRAY:8671 to look at X32's base from F33.
It kept saying "access barred".  I tried from X14, which said "no such host".
I tried from D25, and got a long delay.  Trying to build a new circuit from
the mux produced "ISIS unable to complete request".  That's when I realized
it was 3 very different symptoms of the same problem.  The SUP took over
F33's base at 00:06:29 PST and D25's base at 02:06:32 CST, at which time
the TAUX on D25 finally got through.

RE:  Trw LSI Upgrade


This memo is regarding the pending TRW 2020 LSI upgrade.  Based
on recommendations from John Healy, we proposed to TRW an upgrade
of their LSI from a 1103 to a 1123.  Trw agreed and we located
a LSI 1123 through McDonnell Douglas Field Service Co.  Once we
recieved the LSI board, we determined that TRW did not have the
correct backplane for the LSI board that we had purchased.  In
fact we needed not only a backplane, but a complete new "box"
because of the fact that the current "box" only supported
4 slots and we needed 9 to install the new LSI board.

In the meantime, Joe Smith was staging the proposed configuration
using a DEC PDP 11 Acument machine.  In fact the configuration,
appears to support not 1 but 2 9.6 links into the LSI.  

Based on a coversation that I had with Joe Smith, I contacted 
Ed Roop at the Freemont data center to find out about aquiring
one of these Acument machines.  Based on the fact that the
machines have no current book value, and there are ready to
be sold as scrap, Ed seems to think that we can have the
"box" that Joe is using in San Jose for testing.  Ed will
get back to me next week with confirmation on this.

In other words, with any luck, we can ship the whole configuration,
from Joe Smith's lab in San Jose to TRW and install it as in one
piece, rather than installing boards, backplanes and boxes from
different locations.

Based on the fact, that we were not aware of the complications that
we would run into during this proposed upgrade, we are currently
under pressure from TRW to install this upgrade as quickly as
possible.  I wanted everyone to be aware of this and urge them
work together to complete this installation in a timely manner.

My goal is to have the box from San Jose shipped by the end of
next week (January 27).  And to install the ugrade the following
week by February 10.

Thanks very much for everyone's assistance in this matter.

Subject: SETOP :: OPPS 

Vida & Cynthia,
  As per our discussion on Friday, OPPS has now been modified to allow
users to change their OPER passwords and update the NEW setop data files.
OPPS is now ONLY on system D34.

  A possibly new feature is that a manager need not run SETOP just to
change a user's OPER password, whereas previously you were only allowed
to change your own password with OPPS.  It now validates the user by
requesting an opername and password, then allows the user to change any
opername that is on that user's particular branch.

Subject: GFD SYS 

I looked at GFD.MAC and it appears that someone put in the code to prevent
GFD to SYS: (who knows when) only one problem... it gets the SYS: ppn using
INIT and DEVPPN... why a problem?  DEVPPN skips and they stored the result
in SYSPPN at DEVPPN+1 so the later compare always checked against [0] and
never worked.

Fix: In GFD %14.7, add JFCL after DEVPPN call.  Telecopied to (OSU:*) Please
install if you notice that I've missed it.

Subject: re: SETE %14 

As we had thought, SETE both in the monitor and the program had been
updated.  However, (SYS)SETE.SAV was version %11.  I suspect that the
change was made (2-Dec-87) and never put on SYS because we hadn't put
up the new monitor anywhere except on our test system(s).  Then it was
overlooked.

I will telecopy it everwhere (OSU:*)SETE.SAV, although the source is (MPL).
This is a monitor utility and belongs in (OSU) due to it's nature.

Subject: sendmail configuration 

Steve,
  It seems that tums appends ".tymnet" to addresses such as ontyme or f74,
thus making it hard to reply to received messages that came via tums.  It
also seems to complain that the sender address is unparseable, and looks to
be sending mail to postmaster for each such message (is it?).
  So I restored the old sendmail.cf from yesterday with a change to
recognize things like string@tymix or string@tymix.tymnet as local so the
uucp mail relative to tymix will work (I hope!).  Anything that isn't
local to tymix should get shipped to tums, but this should avoid the loop
we saw yesterday.
  This seems to bear more thought; a good fix might be to get tums to
append ".tymnet.com" to host addresses, which would make things happier.

With the exception of the control sequence for insert-character, I've

I may put it into the %1 copy on (SYS) but that's a project for a rainy day

Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behalf" of another user.

Subject: Re: RUNTIME IN-COMPATIBILITY 

Well... it's like this, FTSYS:SAIL and SYS:SAIL produce identical code at
the moment, however it has NOT always been this way.  There is ONE major
factor that separates these two released versions of SAIL.  They have a
different compiler/runtime version number assembled into them.

Thus, when you link code that has been compiled with one or the other
together, there is this little INIT procedure that gets called at runtime
which makes sure we're all using the same runtimes by checking what version
each module was compiled with.

Whenever it finds one that doesn't match, it complains... unfortunately, it
was never made to understand to tell the poor user what the version numbers
or what modules are at fault.

In NDT, Scott had a program which printed out these version numbers, but it
would take some work to locate it and fit it into TUMS.

To complicate matters, any "require" files that reference (SAILIB), have
an other set of idiosyncracies... they have compile-time switches that check
the compiler version and they attempt (and are 95% right) to load the library
.REL file that matches the right compiler versions.  That's why you'll find
APPEND.REL and APEND.REL, etc... See (SAILIB)SAIL.DEF for some gore... esp.
see the section on get!module or get!library...

Either one or more of the library versions do not match.  Check your RPG.INI
to see what version of SAIL you are using to compile with... Bill may have
used a different version.  Usually (FTSYS) vs (SYS) is the biggie.

I had operations "STORE G3" on B39 and restore on X32 with "MODE OLD NEW" so
that system 32 should have the most recent files.  I'm sure F74 is not up
to date.

I don't know if B39's packs are still mounted; you'd have to ask the Fremont
Data Center.  If not, you could have them restore (SAILIB) from B39's final
all-files tape to some other directory on X32 or F74.

GENTLEMEN,

    I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THE TYMCOM-X GROUP STILL DOES THE
PDP-10 BASE CODE GENERATION. THERE IS A PROJECT #47582 TO REMOVE A 9.6
HARDWIRE AND INSTALL A MEMORY SHUFFLER LINK FROM NODE 4261 TO EBUS
NODE 7004. THE PROJECT LISTS THE BOUND FILE IN THE TYM5 DIRECTORY IS TO
BE LOADED INTO 7004 BUT I NOTICED THE NW7004.BND FILE IS ONLY 63 PAGES
LONG AS COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL 69 PAGES FOR EBUS NODES. I WOULD APPRECIATE
YOUR RESPONSE ON THIS WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE. THE PROJECT IS TENTATIVELY
SCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15TH AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE SURE
THE CODE FOR 7004 IS GOING TO WORK TO BE SURE HOST 31 ISN'T DOWN ANY
LONGER THAN NECESSARY.

    SO TO SUMMARIZE, NODE 7004 NEEDS THE CODE TO LOOK FOR MS LINKS FROM
SWITCHERS ND4261 AND ND5405. THE HOST INTERFACE SLOT SHOULD NOT
NEED TO BE CHANGED BUT I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT TO DECIDE HOW

THE CODE SHOULD BE SET UP.

Subject: MAIL seems to be broken 

  I have been getting a lot of complaints that TUMS seems to be broken.
The carbon-copy feature when used to send to multiple Ontyme names seems
to send the message only to the last listed recipient.
  I seem to remember that one could specify multiple recipients without
using the carbon-copy feature and delimit the recipients with spaces.
This now causes (at least ontyme) to run the names together, causing
other errors.  The earliest complaint dates from 7 Feb., matching the
dates on the distributed files on the PDP-10s.

The header says it came from metaphor to bambam to sunncal to snail to SUN.COM

I sent the original message to figmo@mica.Berkeley.EDU after seeing your

then Sally will have her own account for posting news about the Steven Cannell

If you think the headers YOU get are weird, MY mailer says I got mail
from "sunncal!JMS%F74.Tymnet.COM."

To send mail to YOU, I have to send it to "sunncal!sun!F74.Tymnet.COM!JMS."

Close.  I work at Metaphor; we're down the street from Sun.  I DO use a
Sun 3/50, though (that's what I'm typing at right now).

ORAC?  Never heard of it.  My $$$ are saved up (well, not exactly saved,
BUT...) for Bayfilk, which takes place the 1st weekend in March.  I got an
"A" in my Broadcast Newswriting class (I'd have hung my teacher by his
toenails if I didn't :-) ), an "A" in KFJC, and a "C+" in my Information
Gathering and Research class (not bad for someone who didn't do 3 of the
assignments!).

This semester I'm taking Advanced Radio Reporting, Advanced TV Reporting,
and Reporting Public Opinion, along with KFJC; that comes to 12 units.
I'm taking it easy school-wise this semester because I was sick non-stop
from the beginning of November till now (I'm getting over a sinus infection;
they have me snorting steroids!), and would like to recover.

I finally bought the place I've been living in.  My first mortgage payment
is due Sunday (ouch).  Me, hyper?  Nah... :-)

Cheers,

Subject: DSKCLN cannot handle more than 3 million pages in DSKB: 

DSKCLN has to keep 3 copies of the SATs in memory while it is running.
One SAT read from disk, one SAT being built, and one SAT of trouble pages.
The one from disk is used in FAST mode and the trouble SAT is where
multiply used pages are marked.  DSKCLN can only use 256K of memory.  Since
the program is 16K, that leaves 240K for data.  The maximum size of a single
SAT is 80K.  This means 80*1024*36 = 3047424 pages.  F33 is using 12.5 3652
spindles (25 logical units) with a total of 2995200 pages.  DSKCLN cannot
handle the 26th unit - F33 is maxed out!

I had to remove unit DSKB31 and remove the pointers to that unit from the RIBs
of HOME.SYS, SAT.SYS, and SPAGES.SYS before DSKCLN could run.

Subject: The maximum size of DSKB is 3 million pages. 

When the Fremont Operations attempted to add a 26th pack to F33, it exposed
a previously unknown limitation on the size of DSKB.  The DSKCLN program
cannot run if DSKB is bigger than 3,000,000 pages is size.  The maximum
number of units are:

Memorex 3675 (200 Mb/spindle) = 39 units.
Memorex 3650 (300 Mb/spindle) = 25 units.
Memorex 3652 (600 Mb/spindle) = 12.5 drives = 25 logical units.

F33 is currently using only the BPA5 half of BPA5/BPC5; the BPC5 half is
marked as SPARE and is not part of DSKB.

Subject: F74 has reached limit on number of user names. 

Carl: Anything new on solving Validation's problems yet?

Osman+Craig: Vida Stafford and Julian Min have been having problems adding
new users to F74.  The hash algorithm for both the LUD and the DUL state
that overflow blocks are to be allocated when a block fills up.  It appears
that only system 74 has enough users that blocks are full.  Carl and I have
identified one problem in the LUD that caused programs such as (SYS)LETTER
and (CUD10)USERS to go into an infinite loop when an overflow pointer was
encountered.  This was a case in which programs that create new users in
the LUD and locate users in the LUD worked right, it was programs that
read the entire LUD were broken.

Now the problem is in the DUL.  It looks like ALL of the programs that
write to the DUL are broken.  Only recently have there been enough user names
on a single system to exercise this bug.

Julian,
  I have looked at UPDLUD.MAC and it appears to know how to update both the
LUD and the DUL.  I have NO way of testing it... do you?  (I recall there used
to be a version called UPDTST, that has a human interface instead of the 
program interface that UPDLUD has).

  In the mean time, I have created a source for (CUD10)ADDDUL.SAV and added
code to handle creation of overflow blocks when adding an entry to the DUL.
Please run this program to fixup all the users that you previously tried to
enter and then were unable to add to the DUL.  I would do this but I only
have a partial list:

UPDLUD.  I will talk to you about arranging a time for me to stop by the data

    At present, other than the inconsistancies shown above the LUD and the DUL
meet the specifications we have set for TYMCOM-X.  I see no apparent reason for
WHY you cannot enter userids using TYMVAL/USEVAL and UPDLUD, so something else
must be broken in your interface.

Subject: UPDLUD and LUD/DUL problems 

Julian
  I believe that I have located ONE of the sources to the problems that
have been occurring with UPDLUD.  Apparently, some routines call a function
FINDUL to locate an entry in the DUL block.  This routine assumes that it
will find one of:
       An empty entry,
       The specified entry,  or
       An overflow block pointer

  and what is happenning is that the block is full, but no overflow pointer
has yet been created and the function will loop throughout all of it's data
area uchecking every third word for a zero or negative number before it will
get out of the loop.

  Please look at UPDLUD and the routines DULADD, FINDUL, DULFRE and NONE to
see this interaction.  There may be other areas which have this same *bug*
but this is the only one that I found looking at the code.


  Also,
    I have created a source for (CUD10)ADDDUL.SAV and added code to handle
DUL overflow blocks correctly when adding a new user to the DUL.  The new
version has been dispatched via a telecopy job to all PDP-10 hosts, so I
would appreciate it if you or one of the members of your group would run
ADDDUL to add the missing entries to the DUL.  RUN "USERS" to get a list
of the PPNs, and I believe that you and Mai have the rest of the info on

      canceling it, presumably before anyone else read it.

Julian:  The routines in question are on pages 17 & 18 of the UPDLUD program.
         FINDUL should have some check to make sure that C is less than 177
         or it should return an error.  DULFRE has such a check, and apparently
         is the correct place to go if you are trying to CREATE a new entry.

PPS. At this pont, both the LUD and the DUL on system 74 appear to meet the

Craig,
  This is to let you know that the problems with F74's DUL are NOW fixed.

  The problem I reported to Julian was indeed the culprit, and has been
rectified in his UPDLUD program (by me).  We also located a second problem
with the ADDDUL program, which was corrected this afternoon while I was at
the data center.  We re-entered the missing entries using the new code and
all is well.  (A copy of the LUD and DUL are in FTSYS).

Most of the crashes where when the disk controller interrupted but no
disk transfer was in progress.  Replacing the disk should have eliminated
most of these problems, unless the bad drive wrote unreadable headers
on the tracks.  Give me a call if they still have problems after running
a FULL DSKCLN.

Debbie,

  I received your message regarding disk storage charges for the KL-10.
What you are asking, (only billing for disk storage once a week), would
require some effort to develop such a feature.

  I suggest that -- if this is a requirement, then we ask Bob Brown to
pass the data through a filter which removes disk storage records from
the daily batches except for the one day that he wants to gather that
data.  Bob already has to scan the data and generate header and checksum
records, is should be trivial for him to simply ignore disk storage or
any particular service code records. --

  This method will be most reliable and any changes will be completely
under the control of MDCIS and the MIS departments.

Subject: DSKCLN running out of address space 

Joe,
  If... we had the monitor call to map user virtual memory to physical
memory (.prrw) then... DSKCLN could put it's bit maps in physical memory
[with careful handshake with the monitor]
[better yet, the monitor reserves physical memory (for DSKCLN) until
 the DSKCLR UUO]
...and then DSKCLN could handle *any* size disk structure!

You don't even really have to teach DSKCLN about mapping, just modify the
test/set bit routines to map physical memory like it does for the SATs.
[without mapping physical memory, vpeek/vpoke might work (slowly)].

Subject: Call from Fayez Sarofim 

Monday morning I got a call from Marilyn Bear of Fayez Sarofim (713)654-4484.
The person who had been in charge of their KS-2020 left, and they needed to
have all passwords changed.  Marilyn had changed the OPER license password,
but needed help with the others.  The LVALID program changed the local password
after she logged in as user FS7; I had to telecopy the PASSWO program from
another PDP10 so she could change the TYMNET password for FS7.  Together,
we came up with a new SETE password, which I installed in SYSTEM.SAV and in
the running monitor.

They expected to shut down the KS-2020 on June first, but, as usual, it must
be kept running for another couple of months until the replacement system
is functioning.

Hello,

I saw your name on the net, when you were discussing PDP-10s and I thought
that maybe you could be the one to talk to. I hope you don't mind!

I'm working for Televerket, a company in Sweden that keeps a tymnet-network
for public use. Because I'm working with code-generation and such stuff
on the PDP-10s in San Jose I'm informed that they are going to throw out
the PDP-10s and install Sun-systems instead.

I wonder if you might now what's going to happen to the old PDP-10s?
I, and a couple of friends, are PDP-10-freaks and I thought that
MAYBE there is a slight chance to get one... It's not easy to get your
hands on a PDP-10 in Sweden. There are just 10 or so in the whole country.

Because I, and my friends in our computer association, are very interested
in a PDP-10 we are not afraid of transporting it, even though we know
they usually are very big!

The question is; Do you think there is a chance to get one to our
computer association here in Sweden? 

Regards
Gunnar Brading

On July 27th I got a copy of an ONTYME memo that mentions a KL10 and
supporting hardware on the excess list at zero cost.  It says that
MDISC people can request information from Kaye Towne at (408)922-6375
or sending an ontyme to NSC.EXCESS.  I think outside parties have to
put up a bid - ask Kaye for details.

If you're planning to continue genning code (as opposed to just fooling
around) you need one of two configurations:

KS2020 with 512K words memory
TU45 tape drive and TM03 controller
either a string of RP06 disks (200 Mbytes) or RM03 disks (67 Mbytes)
KMC11 and DR11 connected to the DR on an LSI-11/03 with TYMNET connection

KL10 with at least 1meg words external memory
SA10 channel controller for IBM-compatible disks and tapes
IBM-compatible tape controller for STC tape drives
IBM-compatible disk controller for 3330-II or 3350 disks (Memorex 3652)
PDP-10 BASE (Mini Engine with IPI board and custom DMA interface)

The third configuration was an F3 (in one 19-inch rack) that had a Kennedy
tape and 3 CDC disks in a second rack.  (It's been down for 2 years now.)
