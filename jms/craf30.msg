Subject: "System F30's base shows evidence"... 

  System F30's base shows evidence of a semi-conductor memory board that is
is taking spurious single bit parity errors, which also result in bad
memory read cycles.  This caused the ISIS dispatcher to crash 27 days
ago and may be causing problems for the EBUS.
