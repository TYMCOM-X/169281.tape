THE SOFTWARE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE DELAYED THE CONVERSION ARE BEING RE-
SOLVED AT A RAPID PACE.  WE EXPECT RESOLUTION OF THE REMAINING PROBLEMS
BY THIS WEEKEND.  IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CONVERSION AS ORDERLY AND 
QUICK AS POSSIBLE, WE ARE SCHEDULING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SUPER-
VISOR FOR 3:00 A.M. SUNDAY MORNING, 12/15.  THIS WILL ALLOW ONE WEEK
FOR CONVERSION, WHICH SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE FEW REMAINING NODES.

CURRENT STATUS OF SOFTWARE PROBLEMS ARE:

940 NET - THE AUX CIRCUIT PROBLEM WHICH IMPACTED VALIDATIONS ON MONDAY
          HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND TESTING IS CONTINUING.

E-BUSS - NEW CODE IS BEING LOADED NOW WHICH FIXES THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

         1.  INPUT PROCESSING BEING STOPPED

         2.  LOGINS FROM X.25

         3.  LOGIN FROM HSA

         THE PROBLEM OF LOST OUTPUT DATA IS A BUG IN AN OLD VERSION OF 
         THE MONITOR ON SOME OF THE ADP 10'S.  THE FIX IS TO LOAD THE 
         LATEST VERSION OF THE MONITOR.

HSA KATAKANA - NEW VERSION WHICH FIXES ALL KNOWN PROBLEMS.

GATEWAY - NEW VERSION RELEASED WHICH FIXES:

          1. LOADii PROBLEM

          2. CRASH FROM 6C63

I HOPE I HAVE ADDRESSED ALL OF THE KNOWN PROBLEMS.  IF THERE ARE ANY NEW
CONCERNS, PLEASE RESPOND IMMEDIATELY.  ITIME IS SHORT, AND CONVERSION 
BECOMES MORE CRITICAL WITH EACH PASSING DAY.


THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE IN THIS PROJECT,

The patch applied to all /N10 monitors and to P90 in Paris is the one you
discovered:

	"/Patch to fix character lossage @ SETOUT+1/
	SCNSER:
	SETOUT/
	PAT/SETOM MXMCNT
	PAT+1/SETOM MULCNT+0
	PAT+2/JRST SETOUT+1
	SETOUT/JRST PAT
	PAT+3/PAT:
	PATSIZ/PAT

The problem where the "EXIT" message and/or the period printed by the Monitor
disappearing has not been fixed.  That bug applies only to Monitor generated 
messages when the TTY chunks are full.

We have not seen any occurances where data from a program gets lost.

   Subj:  PIR# 1903 - Your message A40652 & A40655

	The purpose of PIR 1903 is to expand CCT from currently 5-bit
   CCT to 6-bit CCT. With compatibility in mind, the new SUP will support
   one of the following login strings when the circuit is a half-duplex:
	1). 5-bit CCT plus control-H
	2). 6-bit CCT with bit 5 as half-duplex flag. (I adopt your naming
	convention here, where bit 7 and 6 are ignored, bit 4-0 are TID.)

	The second option is new. From the PDP-10 point of view there should
   not be any changes of CCT. The only difference is that the CONSAT has 
   options to specify the half-duplex circuit in the login string, as 
   described above.

	I will call you when we test this feature in Bubbnet, so you can
   help us confirm the compatibility.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  We are currently involved in the process  of installing a Tymnet II base
  on  S90 (the  PDP10  installed here  in St.  Cloud).   Jack Snavely  has
  informed  us of  the  fact  that one  of  the  problems that  have  been
  detected, an  intermittent loss  of characters,  has been  solved on  US
  PDP10's by installing a recent release of the operating system.
 
  As this is one of the reasons why we have reverted to the Tymnet I base,
  and because of the  fact that we would like to test  the new software as
  much as possible, we would like to have the  new monitor release for S90
  very soon.
 
  It may, however, also be necessary  to update other system software. S90
  is currently still  running on a /K  monitor, and a lot  of software may
  have changed since. I  am not aware of what changes  may be necessary to
  move to a  /P monitor, (CUSPS, operator  procedures, user documentation,
  APL-related, etc).
 
  Could you give me the information I  will need to plan this upgrade cor-
  rectly ?  Tentatively, given  the current Tymnet  I elimination  date of
  Dec. 15th,  Tuesday night, Dec. 12th.   our time, seems  appropriate for
  the monitor  upgrade. (this  means the  day of  Dec. 12th.,  your time).
  Could you please confirm this schedule as soon as possible ?
 
  I can be contacted via ontyme on  ct.dpm, or mail to CTMKTG7:930, if you
  need more information or assistance.
 
  Best regards, Peter Stratman.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Peter,

Carl Baltrunas tells me that he has patched the current P034/K Monitor on host
S90, to fix the character-loss bug.  This patch will allow host S90 to work
with the new base.  I'm sure that if Carl where not in a class he would be
giving you this information himself.

The P034/P monitor is not urgently needed for host S90, and thus other
software need not be changed to accomodate the new Tymnet-II base.

Subject: system 39 username purge 

Someone in NTD sent validations a request to delete a list of users not
in NTD.  The list was in progress when Bill Soley noticed that (SPL) had
disappeared and he went to validations and stopped the purge...  I went
to check on 39 and found username (CARL) gone, and called validations to
see what happenned.

In all, 12 GAN 3 usernames were purged.  Bill and I made a list and gave
it to Jan Krivanek to have the accounts restored.  So, if you notice that
things on 39 are missing, ** Don't Panic ***,  they are being restored.

Of concern were: (BRING), (CARL), (DENCOFF), (FLETCHERC), (HELGEM), (JMS),
(SPL) and (TSUCOOP).  There were others, but of no consequence.

Jan assured me that she would put in the batch rquests to have operations
restore the file that were deleted.
