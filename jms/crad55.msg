Subject: Revised status of D55 

12-Mar-88 05:02/Joe (Pager said 817-637-7435, they didn't call Central Dispatch)
Contact:  Dallas Operations, Allen Smith, (214)637-7435
Problem:  System 55 lost an HDA on a 3652 disk.  After redefining the structure,
          ASP said "bad structure size", even though the new DSKB had the same
          number of units as the old DSKB.  7 spindles of 3652 = 14 units.
Diagnosis: Dallas is still running ASP version 6.  That version cannot restore
          from an tapes written from a system using 14 units of 3652 disks.
Solution: They started a rebuild from TITO all-files tapes.  After they had
          restored SYS, I copied ASP version 7 from OSU to SYS on D55 and all
          other systems in Dallas.


At 23:20 Saturday, the restore had gotten as far as the "N"'s.   /Joe

NW5577.BND was created 18-May using a TYM file which specified 2 sync lines.
ND5577.BND was created 19-May when D55's base was upgraded to use SIO.
I rebuilt NW5577.BND today with the right configuration, and copied it to
the standard places - (EBUS) on F33, D25, D54, and (TYM5) on D54
