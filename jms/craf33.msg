  The crash of F33 seems to have been an EBUS induced crash because it
thought that it got a bad key from the PDP.  Can't tell much more than
that now.

The AR.ARX reported in CRA001 is a side effect of a memory parity error.
The other AR.ARX crashes are very consistent.

  1) The KL gets a page fault with code 37, ARX failure while in EXEC mode.
  2) The virtual memory address reported matches the previous instruction.
  3) The PC of the page fault is 122163, at TIMADJ+46 in CLOCK1.
  4) The instruction at the PC is an ADD instruction, opcode 270.
  5) The instruction in the ARX (stored in AC 1 of block 7) has opcode 250.
  6) The ARX got bad parity when the stored instruction changed from 270 to 250.

One explanation would be that the bad parity was deteced when the ARX fetched
the instruction from cache.  If this is true, then the portion of cache which
holds words for locations xxx163 is suspect.  In particular, bit 4 of word 3
in group 034, in all 4 quadrants.

CRA006 is just like all the other AR.ARX crashes mentioned in the message from
JMS on 14-Jun-88 at 17:36.  Bad parity detected in the ARX when opcode 270
lost a bit and became opcode 250.  The previous instruction was MUL T1,-1(P).
I believe that the MUL instruction uses the ARX; maybe that's significant.

Joe;

Please see the crash mail that was sent on System 33 about the BAT
page hardware read errors on BPA14, 15, 16, 17 and BPC10, 11,14,16
and 17.  Can you fixed them?

Also, could you turn off the BIT for [1,44355].UFD(BILLING10).

In your opinion do you think this system may have to be rebuilt.
Can't get rid of the HDEV errors.

The UFD bit has been cleared.
(CUD10)SPAGES.MUP has been deleted (I was working on it at the time of failure).
I think I can clear the BAT pages by forcing it to write out good data.
I will do this later on tonight, when fewer people are on the system, since
the automatic retries stop all other disk activity for 30 seconds, and report
spurious THUNGs.  If that fails, we can copy out the packs, one at a time,
no need to rebuild.  		-Joe

Subject: Hardware read error on BAT pages on F33. 

My guess is that something went wrong with the string controller, and
when the system tried to update the BAT pages, the controller scrambled
sectors 9,10,11,12 on head 0 of cylinder 0 on those drives.  When the
controller does its automatic retries, it takes so long that the other
disks get THUNGs.  The rest of the disk looks OK as long as no-one tries
to read the BAT pages (such as by running TYPBAT).

I'll see if we can reformat just that one track, leaving the rest of the
disk alone.
