Subject: Backup Listings
Is there a way to get listings of the 2nd and further BACKUP diskettes 
from MS-DOS BACKUP V2.05 or V2.11?  I reported the problem to Atlanta 
and just wondered if it ever made it to you?
Simple directory listings with File0001, etc. are not enough to really 
tell me what files are on the diskette.
Thanks for any ideas and keep the net going!

Subject: Memory expansion for 100A
I have a 100A with the 192 kbyte expansion board, and I've just bought 
the 8087 coprocessor board, whic permits expansion of the memory to 832 
kbytes. I presume it's not possible to simply unsolder the 64k chips on 
the 192k board and replace them with 256k chips, but is there any 
reasonably simple way to do this without buying the new-version memory 
board?

Subject: memory board
I don't think so.  If I remember correctly from what one of my friends 
said (he's a graduate C.E. at B.U.), the logic ro memory adresser on 
the board (it manipulates the DRAM chips) is different from that of a 
board with 256K chips.  you can tell that I am not a C.E.!!

Subject: PC100A hard disk boot
You can't boot the 100A from the hard disk without changing to the "B" 
motherboard. However, both MSDOS and CP/M can be "warm" booted after a 
floppy boot to behave as though they were booted from the hard disk. 
For MSDOS, you need to do two things: first, include a line of the form 
"SHELL E:\COMMAND.COM E:\ /P" in your "config.sys" file. Then, include 
a line of the form "SET COMSPEC = E:\COMMAND.COM" in your 
"autoexec.bat" file. Then make sure there's a copy of command.com in 
E:\, and go. For CP/M, you need to pick up a copy of the public-domain 
program "SETHARD.CMD", which is on a number of DEC-centered Fido 
boards. Also helpful is "AUTO-C.CMD", which lets you automate the 
process from a floppy boot; this is also around on the boards. I can 
upload both files here if you can't find them and if the sysop puts 
them up (listening, sysop?).

Subject: MS-DOS/MDRIVE
Friends,
     I have recently been experimenting with MDRIVE on my 100+ machine. 
After much trouble, I was dissapointed to find that I cannot make the 
ramdisk (G: in this case) look like the system drive. Even though I 
sys'ed the disk and copied COMMAND.COM and CONFIG.SYS over, I see that 
those files are read first during a cold boot, and apparrently never 
again. The MS-DOS Advanced User's Guide does not fully explain the use 
of the SHELL command, so does anyone know how to switch the operating 
system over to the ramdisk after cold boot? I am also curious to find 
out how you can bypass the initial directory search in your assigned 
directory, and start searching immediatly from the ramdisk. Having the 
operating system in memory as well as 150Kbytes of utilitys or so would 
surely improve system performance. Does DEC offer more advanced manuals 
on internal MS-DOS instructions?
                                        Thanks   -George-

Subject: Warm boot the the RAMdisk
According to the documents, it should be sufficient to "set comspec = 
g:\command.com", however this does not appear to work
properly on any of the DOS 2.x variants (for any machine). There
is a public-domain program called "comspec.com" which does the
job the "set" command is supposed to do. It's available on a number of 
Fido boards. A version specially configured for those (like me) who 
redefine SWITCHAR to "-" is available on DEC-WARE Fido (212 535-8924). 
It's only 166 bytes, so make the call. Once installed, your autoexec 
file should read something like:
copy command.com g:
set comspec=g:\command.com
comspec g:\command.com
The Rainbow will then go to g: for  a fresh command shell. Also, in 
order to make DOS search g: first, just select it as the default drive. 
There's no other way that I know to do this.

Subject: Q-Bus Rainbow
Why doesn't Digital make a Q-BUS based "Rainbow".  Users could
then add a PDP-11/73 board or MicroVAX board as an upgrade, using
the 8088 board to run MS-DOS programs.
 
I remember seeing an ad for a Q-BUS 8088 board a couple of years
ago in Hardcopy or The DEC Professional.  I thought that it was
a good idea because there are so many peripherals to choose from.
A user upgrading to a PDP-11/73 or MicroVAX could then user the
same cabinet, power supply, backplane, and peripherals.  What
a good selling point this would be.  I know that Digital has a
PDP-11 based co-proccessor board, so why couldn't you have the
8088 board work as one.  Virtual Microsystems and others have
done this.
 
I want to see the Rainbow succeed.  I use a 100+ as a work station
on a VAXCluster.  I enjoyed your talks and comments at the
DECUS meeting in Anahiem.  Is there going to be compiler version
of GWBasic available soon.  Some friends of mine at the University
of Wisconsin have about 30 Rainbows that they would like to convert
some RSTS BASIC software to run on.  I told them that you mentioned
More ? 
that a GWBASIC compiler was being developed during one of your talks.
                                           Thanks

Subject: HELP! (with HD)
Iam sysop of fido 46. For the past 2 months, i have been collecting pd 
software for the rainbow, from fidos, rcpm's, and my employer, 
AT&T/bell labs. I now have over 15 meg of pd stuff, and its growing 
every day. I recently got a chance to acquire a seagate st419 16 meg 
HDisk drive for $300 (brand new) to replace the 5 meg drive i got from 
DEC. I am using the DEC controller board, and the drive works great - 
it plugged in sweet as pie and fired right up.  UNFORTUNATELY, the DEC 
gurus decided to limit thir software for formatting and partitioning 
the hard disk to 10 meg maximum! I'd like to get the use of that unused 
6 meg.  I know there are vendors out there who support more than 10 meg,
 i'd just like to know if there is anyone out there who can tell me how 
to get more than 10 meg of my drive formatted! The DEC engineers i've 
talked to say the problem is strictly a software one - the hardware 
will work fine - but have been unable to help me.  I would appreciate 
it if anyone can tell me where i can find a formatter, or the info i 
need to write one??? It would be a shame if you could plug in a 16meg 
drive, bu NEVER use more than 10 meg! I can be reached at 305-660-6477 
voice (AT&T Info Sys) from 8-5 east, 305-321-1800 voice from 6-11pm,on 
my fido (46), at 305-321-236.  Call ANY time. any help would be greatly 
appreciated. Oh, you can leave a message here too. Thanks.

Subject: graphics on rainbow
David, I am in the same boat as you.  I have several programs that were 
previously written on other machines that I would like to convert to 
the DEC, but have no information on how to access the graphics board.  
GSX is nice, but I have to do this in MSDOS. If you are any good at M/L 
programming, you might try disassembling some other programs that use 
graphics.  However, it would be nice if you wouldn't have to do this 
(Especially since I don't know what legal problems arise from this).  
Please feel free to give me a call at (312) 331-2396.  Maybe between 
the two of use we CAN find out something about the graphics board.

Subject: BORLAND SIDEKICK
There has been some discussion of Borland's handy SIDEKICK program 
among those of use who frequent the VAXsig on CompuServe.  At the 
moment, Borland has no plans to develop a version for the RB but there 
appears to be a real interest in getting something like this up on the 
RB.  We seem to agree there is no reason why it couldn't be done.  This 
is an invitation to Borland, the stong-arms at DCS, or whoever to fill 
a user need.

Subject: SideKick
To All: Please note that this is not a "window" program, nor does it 
start at the touch of a function key.  I's nice, though.
