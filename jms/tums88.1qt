Subject: ARGPAR has problems with TMPCOR 

From (CARL)DIRECT I gave the following command:
*PJ.RCF/INDIRECT=(PJ)*.DAT/TMP:ROL:"ROLAID PJ/S"/RUN:DSK:(XEXEC)ROLAID/RUNOFF:1
and ROLAID said "%no option matching /S".  However, it did correctly pick up
the file name.  When I copied the TMPCOR file to disk, it worked.
  */TMP:FOO:"ROLAID PJ/S"/RUN:DSK:(MPL)PIP ;This line given to (CARL)DIRECT
  *009ROL.TMP=TMP:FOO
  *FOO.FOO=009ROL.TMP^Z
  .CTEST RUN (XEXEC)ROLAID

Examining FOO.FOO with FILDDT showed it to be 4 words long.
  "R","O","L","A","I"
  "D"," ","P","J","/"
  "S",nul,nul,nul,nul
  nul,nul,nul,nul,nul

I guess some sort of end-of-line confusion at end-of-file from TMPCOR.

Yes, /CROSS(MON) was used.  My understanding is that the only thing that
switch does is to tell RPG to put /Q at the end of each file name in the
nnnCRE.TMP file.  I figured it would be trivial to reproduce the TMP:CRE
file if it got deleted as long as *.CRF exists.  Is this correct?  /Joe

Subject: "The next time the system goes"... 

The next time the system goes down with a UIL stopcode, please mention in
the crash mail which tape drives had tmounted on them.  To help us
track down this bug, we also need to know which tape programs (TITO,MAGCON)
were running at the time of the crash.

Subject: X32 needs to be rebuilt. 

In addition to "CAN'T ACCSS LUD.SYS", one of the SAT pages on DSKB2 got
wiped out.  Which means that when I restored LUD.SYS from tape, it scribbled
on top of 226 pages, wiping out several files.  I did an incremental backup
and showed Ali where the bALL FILES tapes are stored.  X322 will be rebuilt on
3652 disks as soon as the disk controller is fixed.  In the mean time,
system 32 is limping alon on the four 3675P disks.   /Joe

Accoring to a posting from USENET, the second BADGE meeting for March
is going to happen this Thursday (3/31), at the regular time & place
(Turing Auditorium, 8:15pm). Rich Miner from the Univ of Lowell CPE
Imaging Research Lab will be talking about the 35 MIPS parallel
coprocessor built for the Amiga. (He might even give a demo!) See you all
there!

Ali

ps. Because sushi is going away, this newsgroup will move over to 
Score, probably starting later today or tomorrow... You can post to
AMIGA@Sushi for another few days, but because Sushi is going away for
good, your postings will go to the bit bucket after this week... Starting
tomorrow, please post to AMIGA@Score. Thank you for your support.

ThThe beeper went off quite a few times while Ed Hall was trying to put in
the digits... I guess the 4th or 5th time in rapid succession he got through.

Date: 16-Jan-88 8:40ish, Contact Ed Hall, 206 697 6402.
      Actual contact, Danny King @home 713 721 4101, for system 370.
      Yes, this is Fayez sarofim...

Problem: Support in diagnosing the hardware problems, cause of system crashes
      over the past month.  FE would like some assistance.

History: Looked at the crashes on disk, CRA004-CRA008, CRA011-CRA014, CRA015.
      All but CRA015 were of the same type; in FILIO, DTASAT+4 had received
      an i/o interrupt for the disk, the PGYIO table says no i/o in progress
      so crash!

      CRA004-CRA007 were on RMA0, CRA008,CRA011,CRA012 were on RMA1, and
      CRA012-CRA014 were on RMA0.  (Danny says they had Fayez swap drives
      for a time).  CRA015 looks like a shutdown... SYSCRS/ NOCRS.

      I looked a little deeper, and tracked the CONO/DATAI info to see if
      there were any common patterns and relayed the info to Danny.  Spent
      a little over 2 hours.

Follow up:  We can look on Monday to see if there is anything else we can
      give to Danny, otherwise, hope the info already given was enough for
      him to track down the problem.

From:    Carl Baltrunas (TXS.C/Baltrunas)

Mr. Kamoi,
  As mentioned in your ONTYME regarding your test data... Could you please
up-load to the TYMCOM-X system the data multiple times, each time putting
the data into files with different filenames (such as TEST1, TEST2, etc.)
and send to me a copy of the results, so that I may examine the data files
directly.

  If you need more disk space temporarily, contact me or Jan Krivanec.

  I would also like you to try up-loading the data using the (SYS)BIONIC
program with the "KATAKANA" command.

    -R BIONIC                     << - normal ASCII mode
    *RUN
    FILE NAME: ....


    -R BIONIC                     << - normal ASCII mode
    *KATAKANA                     << - change to KATAKANA mode
    *RUN
    FILE NAME: ....

  I do not suspect that the problem is with your version of the BIONIK
program, but I wish to eliminate that possibility from my thoughts.  If
you can provide incorrect data transferred with BIONIK "and" incorrect
data transferred with (SYS)BIONIC using the KATAKANA command it may help.

  I am looking for a pattern for how the data corruption is occurring
during the data transfers and I need to be able to compare one copy of
the test data (which is known to be correct) against all copies of the
test data which transfer incorrectly.  Please make one file to keep on
disk that transfers correctly, and as many files containing bad transfer
data as you think reasonable.  The more data I can compare, the better
I will be able to find a pattern.  Please send an ONTYME with the file
names and any additional information you wish to send.

  It is 4:45 am PST now.  If you can send this information in the next 4
or 6 hours, I will look at the data when I wake up in a few hours and see
if we can find a solution.

                                Sincerely,


                                Carl A Baltrunas,  TYMCOM-X Software Support

Re: Study of test files

Makoto,
  I have looked at the test data files on (OHTA:74)  including the new files
produced 18-Jan-88.   I have not found any particular pattern as of this
message.   I will check the logic in the BIONIC program to see how it counts
characters and records to determine if additional bytes of data are inserted
when a carriage-return or line-feed is encountered.  I do not expect any
suprises, but I cannot detect any reason why this problem can be happenning
at this time.   Both the hardware and software appear to be reliable... but
as we can see, the data is corrupted.

  Please notice that I moved the test data from (OHTA:74) to (TXSINFO:74)
because there was room for only 300 more pages in directory OHTA.  I also
copied file JAN.XT and created a file JAN.CAB which is the correct data
from JAN.XT, only in ASCII.  [I have a program which will do that very
easily, in case you have a need for someone to read a KATAKANA file on an
ASCII device, I will tell you where it is and how it works.]

------------------------

Re:  Additional tests.

  I would like you to perform two additional tests at this time.  First,
we want you to up-load the same test data that you have used on system
74 to another system.  I believe you are valid on systems 34 or 35.  If
you could make this test, we could rule out the CPU/Base hardware.

  The second test, will be to re-run the test data again on system 74
after we have put some diagnostic patches into system 74's operating
system.  If both of these tests fail, we will have to try to use the
same hardware, only change the load that is running on the system at the
time of failure.

  One last item...  how many times did you run the test in the past few
days and how many times was the data transferred successfully (if at all)
and how many times unsuccessfully.

  What hours of your working schedule overlap with pacific standard time?
It may be better if I re-arrange my schdule for a few days so that we can
overlap and work on this problem at the same time.

re: Additional testing on F74

------------------------------

Matoko,
  I would like you to please continue to run the tests again on system
D34 in Dallas.  Since the problem is spurious, it is possible that the
conditions were not right for the error to occur on D34.

  We have also reloaded F74 today with my patch to gather information
about a possible cause of the problem.  Please re-run the tests again
on system F74 today and let me know the results.

  I will be working and observing the system from time to time during
your working hours today.  So, messages can be sent and returned on
the same day.  I will check my mail messages every 2 hours today.

  Thank you again for your assistance in tracking down this problem.

Re: Testing of F74 problem

As of this message, we have not seen a reported instance of the situation
we are expecting to occur with our diagnostic patch.  Please continue to run
tests on system F74.

You do not need to run any more tests on D34 unless we find an error on F74.
We do not expect the information gathering patch to solve the problem and
now we must wait until we have a data transfer failure on F74.

Makoto,
  At this point, I would like you to continue testing, only on F74.  My
trap appears to have caught something two times, indicating that the
condition that I thought might happen has occurred.  I have made a fast
revision to the trap and need to verify the repeatability.

  As you say the problem has not occurred, and my trap caught two times,
I believe that someone else (not your test) caught an error.  I am stopping
at the data center to review the trap output and will report to you the
results before tomorrow.

  Please continue testing on F74, so that I may gather more data.  Thank
you again for your help in tracking this problem.

Makoto,
  At this point, I do not expect that your testing will uncover anything
more.  I suggest that we stop the testing until the problem occurs again.
My trap has uncovered a potential problem with information passed from the
PDP-10 Base to the host with the wrong byte count.  I believe that it may
be caused when the base is overloaded.  I have attempted to overload the
base a few times since last week to trap the condition and we have trapped
three (3) times for certain, and numerous other times we suspect but are
not certain.

  I will leave the current trap in system F74 until we decide that a fix
has been found for the problem.  I will have resources verify which other
hosts use BIONIC or BIONIK and will install the trap on those systems as
well.  I believe that the problem we are seeing is not limited to system
F74, and may occur when the base is overloaded and some other conditions
exist at the same time.  At present, we cannot reliably re-create the
problem.

  As for your customers... if they report a problem, please see if they
can keep the erroneous data long enough to compare with a re-transmission
so that we can check our trap.  Their good data should be replaced with
a multiple of four (4) bytes of the ascii character "U" (octal 125, hex 55).
This same value will be found both in ascii text and ktakana text files
due to the nature of how block-io input is stored in memory.

  Thank you again for all the testing that you have done.  I will send
you a copy of the "suspicious" traps with username, program and times that
we saw a possible transmission failure.

Re:     A temporary solution to F74's problem

================================================================

Makoto,
    So sorry for the delay in answering messages from NIS in the past
week.  We have been investigating the problem further and working on
a solution.

    The problem as we currently understand it is caused by a flaw in
the implementation of the high-speed BLOCK-IO input from the network
base to the PDP-10.  The KL-10 hardware uses special cache memory to
increase the processor speed by only reading physical memory when it
is absolutely necessary.  The network base writes BLOCK-IO input into
physical memory and then notifies the PDP-10 when data is available.
If portions of the BLOCK-IO buffer still exist in the hardware cache
the old memory contents are passed to the user instead of the new data
from physical memory.  This problem did not exist on the KI-10 cpu and
was apparently overlooked when the monitor was modified to run on the
newer KL-10 cpu.

    A final solution will have to be made as part of our next cycle
of development on the operating system, however we have worked out a
temporary solution of forcing the BLOCK-IO input buffers to be read
directly from physical memory.  We expect to finish the testing of
this fix this afternoon and will make it available for system F74 as
soon as possible.

    My only question at this time concerns what other PDP-10 systems
will we need to apply this fix.  On what other systems do you and your
customers use the BIONIC or BIONIK programs?

    In regards to the list of usernames found in our traps... we have
determined that the trap caught many more events than actually occured
and we could not depend on any of them.  What happenned was that the
trap detected an event when the base message passed BLOCK-IO to the
operating system because cache had not been updated, but by the time
the operating system passed the data to the user, the cache data was
correct.  This is why we thought we trapped an error, yet you and your
customers found no errors in late January.

    Now, we are sure the problem is due to cache references and have
disabled the trapping while we work on the solution.

    I will send you another message at the time we are ready to reload
system F74 with the "fix" version of the operating system.

re:    F74 Patch installation

---------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto,

    Thank you for your patience.  We have concluded the testing of our
patch to the operating system and it was installed on system F74 this
morning.  Please let us know if there are any additional problems.

 -  System F74 was reloaded with the patched monitor F74-P035/D-1 on
    2-Mar-88 at 11:33 PST.

 -  There is some confusion with the meaning of "newer KL-10" cpu.  The
    KL-10 cpu is newer than the old KI-10 cpu which system 34 used to
    be when it was located in Cupertino.  System 74 has always been a
    KL-10 cpu.

 -  The problem you have been experiencing with BIONIC and BLOCK-IO has
    always existed on the KL-10 cpu.  However, since it has always been
    intermittant, it was never brought to our attention until December.
    It was thought to be a host-base interface problem due to a similar
    problem discovered 5 years ago on system D54.  Now, we understand
    that the problem on D54 was probably the same as F74.  The changes
    made to D54 5 years ago changed the timing of the memory references
    and the problem was never seen again.  This time, more research was
    done and the problem with the cache holding "old" information gives
    us the ability to duplicate the problem and provide a solution.

 -  Why the problem "suddenly" appeared is unknown.  Probably a subtle
    change in the operating system timing or the mix of applications on
    the system is the answer.  Also, it is clear that the problem may
    have been present but undetected since September when the customer
    base of NIS was moved from system 34 to 74.

 -  So that you may provide an explanation of the problem to your own
    customers, here is the technical detail about the problem we have
    found and corrected with our patch to the system.

     o  The BIONIC and BIONIK programs both use a special high-speed
	communications protocol which allows large amounts of character
	data to be passed between the host and the network base without
	causing the host to process each data byte.  This is BLOCK-IO.

     o  BLOCK-IO utilizes multi-ported memory on the PDP-10 to place the
	data directly into buffers which the PDP-10 then passes directly
	to the user application (BIONIC).

     o  On the model KI-10 cpu all memory references were buffered by the
	hardware, but retrieved from physical memory, so all BLOCK-IO data
	coming in from the base was passed to the user application.

     o  On the model KL-10 cpu all memory references are still buffered by
	the hardware, but a second high-speed cache retains data recently
	referenced by the cpu and references to data stored in those memory
	addresses are retrieved from the cache whenever possible.

     o  Normal host-base messages are uncached and are always retrieved from
	physical memory.   BLOCK-IO data buffers currently reside in part of
	the dynamic memory pool which is cached for fast data access.  Since
	the BLOCK-IO buffer headers were referenced by the cpu to setup the
	data transfer, these memory addresses and some nearby addresses were
	stored in the cache.  After the transfer the cpu references the data
	to pass it to the user application and instead of retrieving all of
	the data from physical memory, some data is retrieved from the cache.

     o  Cache is filled in 4-word chunks.  The format of the BLOCK-IO block
	is 6-words of header and 100-words of data.  The header is always on
	a 4-word boundary and thus the last 2 words of the header and the
	first 2 words for the data are in the cache at the same time.  The
	last word of the header is the byte count and is always referenced
	prior to the transfer (pulling all 4 words into the cache).  Thus,
	the first 2 words of the data buffer are retrieved from the cache
	instead of physical memory for most of the transfers.

     o  Most of the time the cache data containing the above 4-word chunk is
	flushed or overwritten with a different 4-word chunk of addresses.
	That is why this problem is not repeatable upon demand.  In the few
	instances when the job mix on the system does not flush this 4-word
	block, the user application receives 2 words of "old" data.  Each
	word contains 4 bytes and that is why we see 8 data bytes with bad
	information when the problem occurs.

     o  The temporary solution for the problem is to mark the part of the
	dynamic memory pool used by BLOCK-IO buffers as uncached.  In this
	way we will achieve the same reliability that we had with BLOCK-IO
	on the model KI-10 cpu.

     o  The long-term solution will be to separate the BLOCK-IO data buffers
	from the rest of the dynamic memory pool and place them in a separate
	pool of uncached memory.  This will be done during our next monitor
	development cycle.

 -  The explanation above should answer any of the questions you may have
    had about the problem.  We have installed the temporary fix to system
    F74 at this time.  If you wish that we install the temporary fix to
    system D34, please let me know in your next message.

 -  The file (HAL:74)SHAMK2.NIS appears to be a victim of this same problem.
    BIONIC and BIONIK translate occurances of CR or LF in the data stream to
    CR + LF.  Therefore, if each record is transmitted as 80 characters + CR
    then the data file will contain 80 characters + CR LF, and if the 8 bytes
    including the CR are overwritten, we will see 80 + 80 + 1 + CR LF which
    is confirmed by the 161 characters + CR LF see in the output file.

Thank you again for your help in researching the problem and in testing
the modifications made to track down the source of the problem.  Please
let me know if the problem occurs again.

Best regards,

/Carl

Problem:  System 55 lost an HDA on a 3652 disk.  After redefining the structure,
          ASP said "bad structure size".  It did not say whether there were too
          many or too few units in the new structure.
Solution: Told them to verify that the new DSKB had exactly the same number of
          units as when the ASP was done.  The highest unit can be found at the
          end of the hardcopy from when ASP was run.

Problem:  When bringing up the system READONLY to run ASP as part of operator
          training, it died with a NONAME stopcode in SCHED1.
Diagnosis: LOGINN was trying to update the LUD to turn off the 6 letter bits
          to indicated that OPER had seen the "system is going down" message.
          During READONLY, updating ENTERs are allowed.  However, when the
          program issues an OUT uuo or VALPAG chanio, the system crashes.
Solution: Told them to come up MANUAL this time to do the ASP.  Later analysis
          showed that they could have come up MANUAL, run TAKEIT to HANG the
          system, and then come up READONLY.
Note:     Looking at the monitor source code implies that this bug existed
          prior to P034/N.  One way around it is to come up using "NOINITIA"
          and "FULL", then login as OPER (which clears the bits in the LUD)
          to run TAKEIT and "HANG" the system.  That leaves the files is the
          proper state to bring up "CONSOLE" and "READONLY" so the OPER can
          login and run ASP.  This will be fixed in next release of the monitor.

Problem:  One user had 30 jobs logged in, all detached, all running MAGNUM
          programs.  The jobs would not go away immediately - LOGOUT and TAKEIT
          only evicted them.  System was heavily loaded and very slow.
Solution: None.  By the time I logged in, all these jobs had logged out.
          MAGNUM enables notice-to-quit (NTQ) so that it can clean up after
          itself and leave the database in a consistent state.  Until the clean
          up is done, the job can be evicted but not killed.

Subject: Cause of PCBFL1 stopcodes on D37 located and fixed. 

Whenever a program such as TAKEIT or ICP tries to peek on physical core,
the PEKCHK routine is called.  It had the following code:
	LSH	PG,-^D9		;Convert word address to page number
	LDB	T3,PGYNXM	;Is page known to be nonexistant?
	CAIL	PG,340		;T3 can't be trusted for unmapped area
	 JUMPN	T3,CPOPJ	;Give error return, page not accessable

PGYNXM is valid only for user core.  There are no entries allocated in the
PGY tables for monitor core (since it never swaps).  That is, if the monitor
has 754 pages allocated to itself and the system has 20000 pages total, then
the PGY tables are set up for PGYXXX[754:17777].  Using a value below 754
will access a word that is lower than the start of PGYXXX.  Depending on the
number of disks, number of jobs, and number of physical pages, the PGY
tables may be allocated at 400000 and above.  On system D37, the tables
moved to 400000 when the 2nd string of 3652's were defined.  Due to the
bug, a check on page 26 would cause a reference to the word at 377052.
The page fault handler knows page 377 belongs to %SAT, however %SAT was not
in used at the time, ergo stopcode PCBFL1.  The fix is:
	LSH	PG,-^D9		;Convert word address to page number
	CAMGE	PG,SYSSZP	;Is it part of the resident monitor?
	 TDZA	T3,T3		;Yes, page exists and has no NXM entry
	LDB	T3,PGYNXM	;Check if user-core page exists
	JUMPN	T3,CPOPJ	;Give error return, page not accessable

Subject:  DEC-10



It is the intent of MDNSC to get off of DEC-10 systems and convert our
existing applications, as necessary, to appropriate alternate
environment within the next 12 months.  This decision is based on the
recommendations made by an internal task force on hardware planning.
This migration will eliminate excessive IPC charges and also get us off
an archaic and inflexible computing environment that we have been using
for nearly 15 years.  While purchase of departmental processors might be
appropriate for applications specific to your groups only, common
hardware/software strategy may be required for applications such as code
management, validations, documentation, accounting, etc.

Please collect the information on your current DEC-10 based applications
in the format suggested by April 1 and return it to your representative
of the Hardware Planning Task Force.  The members of the task force are:

Raja Rajaraman - Operations 
Ken Holcomb - NTD 
Gary Walker - Marketing and Sales 
Sateesh Lele/Fred Canning - Finance (HR, Legal, Business Planning, if 
necessary)

Your cooperation in this matter is extremely critical in order to put
together an intelligent and consistent hardware/software strategy.

Thank you for your compliance.

Subject: What went wrong on F22, F33, F58. 

Patch #3 from the original IMEPAR.PAT had a bug.  It picked up the page-fail
code from UPT+501 instead of UPT+500.  This means that when a page fault
occured, if the PC flags had CARRY0 + CARRY1 + FLOAT_OVERFLOW + FIRST_PART_DONE 
+ USER all set, then the patch would say it was an ARX error, and jump to
the parity error routine.  APRER1 saw the USER flag set and tried to locate
the word with the bad parity error by scanning all of the user's core.  Since
it couldn't find any parity error in memory (the problem was in the cache,
not in core), the routine had no alternative but to wipe out all of that
user's core.  It marked all his pages as having read errors.  The routine
that frees up user core saw the read error bit set, so it added all of
those pages to the BAT page.

The final fix did not get installed into P035/D-4 until about 6pm, Tuesday
March 29.  The AR.ARX dumps on F22 and F58 prior to that time are bogus.

All Fremont systems are now up to date.  The way to check the crash dumps,
NEWMON, and/or the running system is to look at location PATCH+26 and
verify that the RH is UP%500, not UP%500+1.   /Joe
