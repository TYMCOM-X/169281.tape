This is in response to a request that I received immediately
after creation of the group and a posting regarding the name
of the system.

The request was that I repost the basic "isis release" blurb
for anyone who might be interested in subscribing to this newsgroup
but unaware of just what the ISIS toolkit does.  The blurb follows.

With regard to the name ISIS, our group has existed as an academic
project funded by DARPA for about 6 years now, during which we have
published extensively on a system called the "ISIS Toolkit".
We named the project (which is concerned with fault-tolerance)
after the Egyptian Goddess Isis, who brought Osiris back to
life after he was torn apart by Seth in an epic battle.  The ISIS
Toolkit doesn't go quite as far, but it can be a pretty powerful
facility nonetheless.

This newgroup was established because we now have quite a few
users, 200 at last count, and this has created pressure for a forum
within which suggestions, bug fixes, user-developed software, etc.
could be exchanged.  The group was created after the usual discussion
period and vote in news.groups.

It is true that INTEL has an operating system by the same name,
and presumably a trademark on the ISIS name.  However, we know
of no trademark on the "ISIS Toolkit", and in any case ISIS is
not a commercial product -- the source is in the public domain.
INTEL has never asked us to cease using the name, and we think
it is fairly clear that our system has nothing to do with the
INTEL ISIS OS.  Hopefully, INTEL won't decide to take action now!
At any rate, we make a real effort not to use the name ISIS in a
way that might confuse people.

--- standard isis blurb ---

This is to announce the availability of a public distribution  of
the  ISIS  System,  a  toolkit for distributed and fault-tolerant
programming.  The initial version of ISIS runs on  UNIX  on  SUN,
DEC,  GOULD,  and  HP  systems, although ports to other UNIX-like
systems are planned for the future.  No kernel changes are needed
to support ISIS; you just roll it in and should be able to use it
immediately.  The current implementation of ISIS performs well in
networks of up to about 100-200 sites.


--- Who might find ISIS useful? ---

You will find ISIS useful if you  are  interested  in  developing
relatively sophisticated distributed programs under UNIX (eventu-
ally, other systems too).  These include programs that distribute
computations over multiple processes, need fault-tolerance, coor-
dinate activities  underway  at  several  places  in  a  network,
recover  automatically from software and hardware crashes, and/or
dynamically reconfigure while maintaining some  sort  of  distri-
buted  correctness  constraint at all times.  ISIS is also useful
in building certain types of distributed real time systems.

Here are examples of problems to which ISIS has been applied:

   o On the factory floor, we  are  working  with  an  industrial
     research  group  that is using ISIS to program decentralized
     cell controllers.  They need to arrive at a modular, expand-
     able, fault-tolerant distributed system.  ISIS makes it pos-
     sible for them to build such a system without a huge invest-
     ment  of  effort.  (The ISIS group also working closely with
     an automation standards consortium called  ANSA,  headed  by
     Andrew Herbert in Cambridge).

   o As part of a network file system, we built an  interface  to
     the  UNIX  NFS (we call ours the "RNFS") that supports tran-
     sparent file  replication  and  fault-tolerance.   The  RNFS
     speaks NFS protocols but employs ISIS internally to maintain
     a consistent distributed state.  For  most  operations,  the
     RNFS  performance is at worst 50-75% of that of a normal NFS
     -- despite supporting file replication and fault-tolerance.

   o A parallel "make" program.  Here, ISIS  was  used  within  a
     control  program that splits up large software recompilation
     tasks  and  runs  them  on  idle  workstations,   tolerating
     failures  and  dynamically  adapting  if  a  workstation  is
     reclaimed by its owner.

   o In a hospital, we have looked at using ISIS to manage repli-
     cated data and to coordinate activities that may span multi-
     ple machines.  The problem here is  the  need  for  absolute
     correctness:  if a doctor is to trust a network to carry out
     orders that might impact on patient health, there is no room
     for  errors due to race conditions or failures.  At the same
     time, cost considerations argue for distributed systems that
     can  be  expanded  slowly  in  a fully decentralized manner.
     ISIS addresses both of these issues: it makes it far  easier
     to  build  a reliable, correct, distributed system that will
     manage  replicated  data  and  provide  complex  distributed
     behaviors.  And, ISIS is designed to scale well.

   o For programming numerical algorithms.  One group at  Cornell
     used  ISIS  to  distribute  matrix  computations  over large
     numbers of workstations.  They did this because the worksta-
     tions were available, mostly idle, and added up to a tremen-
     dous computational engine.

   o In a particle physics experiment.  We  are  talking  to  one
     group that hopes to use ISIS to implement a distributed con-
     trol program.  It will operate data collection devices, farm
     out  the  particle  track  calculations  onto lightly loaded
     workstations, collect the results,  and  adapt  to  failures
     automatically  by reconfiguring and shifting any interrupted
     computation to an operational machine.

The problems above are characterized by several features.  First,
they  would all be very difficult to solve using remote procedure
calls or transactions against some shared  database.   They  have
complex,  distributed  correctness constraints on them: what hap-
pens at site "a" often requires a coordinated action at site  "b"
to  be  correct.   And,  they do a lot of work in the application
program itself, so that the ISIS communication mechanism  is  not
the bottleneck.

If you have an application like this, or are interested in taking
on  this  kind  of  application,  ISIS  may be a big win for you.
Instead of investing resources in building an environment  within
which  to  solve  your application, using ISIS means that you can
tackle the application immediately,  and  get  something  working
much faster than if you start with RPC (remote procedure calls).


--- What ISIS does ---

The ISIS system has been under development for several  years  at
Cornell  University.   After  an  initial  focus on transactional
"resilient objects", the emphasis shifted in 1986  to  a  toolkit
style  of  programming.   This approach stresses distributed con-
sistency in applications that  manage  replicated  data  or  that
require  distributed  actions  to  be taken in response to events
occurring in the system.  An "event" could be a user request on a
distributed service, a change to the system configuration result-
ing from a process or site failure or recovery, a timeout, etc.

The ISIS toolkit uses a subroutine call style  interface  similar
to  the interface to any conventional operating system.  The pri-
mary difference, however, is  that  ISIS  functions  as  a  meta-
operating  system.   ISIS system calls result in actions that may
span multiple processes and machines in the  network.   Moreover,
ISIS  provides  a  novel  "virtual  consistency"  property to its
users.  This property makes it easy to build  software  in  which
currently  executing processes behave in a coordinated way, main-
tain replicated data, or otherwise satisfy a system-wide correct-
ness  property.   Moreover,  virtual synchrony makes even complex
operations look atomic,  which  generally  implies  that  toolkit
functions  will  not  interfere  with  one another.  One can take
advantage of this to develop distributed ISIS software in a  sim-
ple  step-by-step style, starting with a non-distributed program,
then adding  replicated  data  or  backup  processes  for  fault-
tolerance  or higher availability, then extending the distributed
solution to support dynamic reconfiguration, etc.  ISIS  provides
a  really  unique style of distributed programming -- at least if
your distributed computing problems run up against the issues  we
address.   For  such  applications, the ISIS programming style is
both easy and intuitive.

ISIS is really intended for, and is good at, problems  that  draw
heavily  on  replication of data and coordination of actions by a
set of processes that know about one  another's  existence.   For
example,  in  a factory, one might need to coordinate the actions
of a set of machine-controlled drills at  a  manufacturing  cell.
Each  drill  would  do  its  part of the overall work to be done,
using a coordinated  scheduling  policy  that  avoids  collisions
between  the  drill heads, and with fault-tolerance mechanisms to
deal with bits breaking.  ISIS is ideally suited to solving prob-
lems  like  this  one.  Similar problems arise in any distributed
setting, be it local-area network software for the  office  or  a
CAD  problem,  or  the  automation of a critical care system in a
hospital.

ISIS is not intended for transactional database applications.  If
this  is  what  you  need, you should obtain one of the many such
systems that are now available.  On the other hand, ISIS would be
useful  if  your  goal  is to build a front-end in a setting that
needs databases.  The point is that  most  database  systems  are
designed  to  avoid interference between simultaneously executing
processes.  If your application also  needs  cooperation  between
processes  doing  things  concurrently at several places, you may
find this aspect hard to solve  using  just  a  database  because
databases  force  the  interactions to be done indirectly through
the shared data.  ISIS is good for solving this kind of  problem,
because  it  provides  a direct way to replicate control informa-
tion, coordinate the actions of the front-end processes,  and  to
detect and react to failures.

ISIS itself runs as a user-domain program on  UNIX  systems  sup-
porting  the  TCP/IP protocol suite.  It currently is operational
on SUN, DEC, GOULD and HP versions of UNIX.  A  MACH  version  is
now running at Cornell and will be released later this spring, as
will a FORTRAN-ISIS interface and a port to the APOLLO UNIX.  And,
a LISP-ISIS interface (from Allegro) is now being tested and will
be included into ISIS release V1.2 (planned for May 1989).

The actual set of tools includes the following:

   o High performance mechanisms supporting lightweight tasks  in
     UNIX,  a  simple message-passing facility, and a very simple
     and  uniform  addressing  mechanism.   Users  do  not   work
     directly  with things like ports, sockets, binding, connect-
     ing, etc.  ISIS handles all of this.

   o A process "grouping" facility, which  permits  processes  to
     dynamically  form and leave symbolically-named associations.
     The system serializes changes  to  the  membership  of  each
     group: all members see the same sequence of changes.  Groups
     names can be used as a location-transparent address.

   o A suite of  broadcast  protocols  integrated  with  a  group
     addressing  mechanism.   This  suite  operates in a way that
     makes it look as if all broadcasts are received  "simultane-
     ously"  by  all  the members of a group, and are received in
     the same "view" of group membership.

   o Ways of obtaining distributed executions.   When  a  request
     arrives in a group, or a distributed event takes place, ISIS
     supports any of a variety of execution styles, ranging  from
     a  redundant computation to a coordinator-cohort computation
     in which one process takes the requested actions while  oth-
     ers back it up, taking over if the coordinator fails.

   o Replicated data with 1-copy consistency guarantees.

   o  Synchronization  facilities,  based  on  token  passing  or
     read/write locks.

   o Facilities for watching a for a process or  site  (computer)
     to fail or recover, triggering execution of subroutines pro-
     vided by the user when the  watched-for  event  occurs.   If
     several  members  of  a  group watch for the same event, all
     will see it at the same "time" with respect to arriving mes-
     sages  to  the group and other events, such as group member-
     ship changes.

   o A facility for joining  a  group  and  atomically  obtaining
     copies of any variables or data structures that comprise its
     "state" at the instant before the  join  takes  place.   The
     programmer who designs a group can specify state information
     in addition to the state automatically maintained by ISIS.

   o Automatic restart of applications when a  computer  recovers
     from  a crash, including log-based recovery (if desired) for
     cases when all representatives of a service fail  simultane-
     ously.

   o Ways to build transactions or  to  deal  with  transactional
     files  and  database  systems external to ISIS.  ISIS itself
     doesn't know about files or transactions.

Everything in ISIS is fault-tolerant.  Our programming manual has
been  written  in  a tutorial style, and gives details on each of
these mechanisms.  It includes examples  of  typical  small  ISIS
applications and how they can be solved.  The distribution of the
system includes demos, such as the parallel  make  facility  men-
tioned  above;  this  large  ISIS application program illustrates
many system features.

To summarize, ISIS provides a broad  range  of  tools,  including
some  that  require algorithms that would be very hard to support
in other systems or to implement by hand.  Performance  is  quite
good:  most  tools require between 1/20 and 1/5 second to execute
on a SUN 3/60, although the actual  numbers  depend  on  how  big
processes  groups get, the speed of the network, the locations of
processes involved, etc.  Overall, however, the system is  really
quite fast when compared with, say, file access over the network.
For certain common operations  a  five  to  ten-fold  performance
improvement  is expected within two years, as we implement a col-
lection of optimizations.  The system scales well with  the  size
of  the  network,  and  system overhead is largely independent of
network size.  On a machine that is not participating in any ISIS
application, the overhead of having ISIS running is negligible.


--- You can get a copy of ISIS in the near future ---

A prototype of ISIS is now fully operational and  is  being  made
available  to the public.  The version we plan to distribute con-
sists of a C implementation for UNIX, and has been ported to  the
SUN  UNIX  system, ULTRIX, the Gould UNIX implementation, and HP-
UX.  Performance is uniformly good.  A 225 page tutorial and sys-
tem  manual  containing  numerous  programming  examples  is also
available.

The remainder of this posting focuses on how to get ISIS, and how
to get the manual.  Everything is free except bound copies of the
manual.  Source is included, but the  system  is  in  the  public
domain, and is released on condition that any ports to other sys-
tems or minor modifications remain in  the  public  domain.   The
manual  is  copyrighted  by the project and is available in hard-
copy form or as a DVI file, with figures available  for  free  on
request.


--- Release schedule ---

 June 1: a BETA release of the system  for  reasonably  sophisti-
     cated  sites  that can deal with software that will probably
     still have some bugs.  The system, as of June  1,  will  not
     scale beyond about 150 sites at one time.

 August 1: a final release of  the  June  1  system  and  a  BETA
     release  of  a  version containing some performance enhance-
     ments and some tools that are missing from the  June-1  Beta
     release  (notably,  an  interface from ISIS to transactional
     systems like CAMELOT).


--- Release strategy ---

We will place a compressed TAR image in a public directory on one
of our machines and permit people to copy it off using FTP.  Also
available will be DVI  format  versions  of  our  manual.   Bound
copies  will  be  available at $10 each.  A package of figures to
glue into the DVI version will be provided free of charge.

A tape containing ISIS will be provided to a  limited  number  of
sites  upon  payment of a charge to cover our costs in making the
tape.  Our resources are limited and we do not wish to do much of
this.


--- Commercial support ---

We are working with a local  company,  ISIS  Distributed  Systems
Inc.,  to  provide  support services for ISIS.  This company will
prepare distributions and work to fix  bugs.   Support  contracts
are  available  for an annual fee; without a contract, we will do
our best to be helpful but make no promises.  Other services that
IDS  plans  tovide will include consulting on fault-tolerant
distributed systems design, instruction on how to work with ISIS,
bug  identification  and  fixes,  and  contractual joint software
development projects.  The company is also prepared to port  ISIS
to   other  systems  or  other  programming  languages.   Contact
"birman@gvax.cs.cornell.edu" for more information.


--- If you want ISIS, let us know ---

Send mail to schiz@gvax.cs.cornell.edu, subject  "I  want  ISIS",
with electronic and physical mailing details.  We will send you a
form for acknowledging agreement with the conditions for  release
of the software and will later contact you with details on how to
actually copy the system off our machine to yours.
