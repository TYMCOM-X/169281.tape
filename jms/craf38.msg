   SYSTEM CRASHED TO BOOTS. SAVED CRASH. RELOADED EBUS FROM
   D54 WITH NO PROBLEMS.
   
   SHORTLY AFTER SYSTEM ANSWERED AND WE LOGGED IN, EBUS
   DROPPED FROM NET AGAIN. THIS TIME AN INIT WORKED.
   NETCON HAD NO IDEA WHY THIS WAS HAPPENING WHEN WE
   CALLED TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY NETWORK PROBLEMS.
   THE ONLY THING THAT HAPPENED ABOUT THIS TIME WAS
   WE CHANGED FROM SUP 4 TO SUP 1.

Joe,
  I noticed that the EBUS slot for host 38 seems to haken a
dispatcher crash.  Needless to say, the ISIS rings aren't saved,
so it isn't really possible to tell why the dispatcher got peeved
at the slot.

Is unknown what caused the TTYZNE, but ZNE means Zapper Not Echoed; the base
tried to re-use a port that was in the process of being zapped.  The engine
then took a Dispatcher crash in slot 1, which caused stopcode BASE to be
output.  The PDP-10 realized that the base was down, and got TTYFLM while
trying to detach all zapped circuits.  The noname stopcode SCNSER+6145 is
a side effect if TTYFLM - Free List Messed-up.

In summary, F38 went down as a result of a Dispatcher crash in its base.
Paul Krumviede says we are unable to determine the cause of
the crash because there is no dump of the dispatcher rings.

  Node 7021 took a 441 kernel crash (legal illegal instruction interrupt)
and the memory log shows a single bit parity error.  This is symptomatic

Subject: F38'S DSKB24 is very sick. 

Right now, Rick is trying dto do a save to tape, but it tool 10 minutes
for ASP to save the first 5 cylinders.  One tyme I stopped it when it got to
the 2nd cylinder to type "PSP".  It reported that BPB6 had
SDAT:12, SDEV:5, HDAT:6, HDEV:20.  PACKP5 died at cylinder 21, we're hoping
that ASP can make it to the end of the disk.  If not, rebuild time.   /Joe

Subject: QIKSAV on F38 

Yesterday, one of F38's problems was that the first RIB pointer in [1,1].UFD
got clobbered.  There was nothing in SPAGES because no-one ran QIKSAV after
the conversion to pages.  The correct pointer was easy to determine, since
the remaining 6 were sequential.  But all that effort was for naught, as
a result of BPB6(DSKB24) having too many unreadable pages.

I ran QIKSAV on F38 and F29 today.

If you need to copy out pack 380102 tonight on System 38, be sure

you ZFORMATT the pack (unit) you will be copying too first.  The last

time this pack was copies the Unit it was copied to was NOT ZFORMATTED


first.  This may be the reason so many SDEV errors have been reporting.

Whenever a COPY is performed, the Unit to be copied too SHOULD always

be ZFORMATTED first.

Node 7021 had problems at 5:42am today.  After being INITed, the base
was not completely in sync with system 38, and no aux circuits could
be built.  TELECO, TAUX, and other programs hung.  While I was trying to
rectify the situation, the base got an illegal message and crashed the
PDP-10.  TELECO now works after the reboot.

DIAGNOSTICS ON THEM.  EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT O.K
RESTARTED THE 3 JOBS THAT WERE RUNNING AND WE

REPLACED THAT TAPE AND EVERYTHING STARTED RUNNING
JUST FINE..
