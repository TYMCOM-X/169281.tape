-----------------------------------------------------------------------



Don,
 
I recently was forwarded a copy of V.Warker's memo regarding system
37, I would like to cover two points;
 
One - To our knowledge system 37 no longer has a backup machine. F22
      used to be it but it was shutdown long ago. Vicki referenced
      F26 however we show that as system 31's backup machine.
 
Two - When system 37 did come up no files were flagged bad - later
      when Joe Smith was contacted about this he did not have an  
      explanation.
 
Two of my operators devoted all of their time restoring approx
200 files - it so happens the VA files were in the middle of the
list, and Tymnet Vienna was notified of this.
                                                                Page  2

 
A HDA was replaceed (3352) so we donot foresee any more disk
structure problems with D37. We were fortunate that we did not have
to rebuild the entire system - as you know , this can take days...

Subject: "Re: System 37 Rebuild After several"... 

Re: System 37 - Rebuild

After several attempts to boot the system and bring it up read-only it was
apparent that the system was having a problem writing to one of the drives.
Presumably the drive that PAKCOP could not copy out due to a bad head.

I had Janet reboot and set a DDT breakpoint at the NOWRIT stopcode to
determine the cause of the failure.  The page in question was a SAT page
and if the NOWRIT was disabled, the system would have crashed due to a
WRTSAT stopcode.

Final result... PAKCOP could not copy out the pack, and since the system
could NOT be brought up with the bad head on BPB5 due to NOWRIT, the best
course of action is to rebuild.  Fortunately, an ASP dump was taken last
night, so the system should be up and running sometime shortly after noon.

Joe concurred on the PAKCOP failure, that it probably would be best to do
a rebuild.  Since an ASP was done last night, and a head went bad, there
really is NO way to recover the data on that disk surface.
