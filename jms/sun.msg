Eric, the permissions were not setup correctly yesterday. The were reestablished
today so the problem should not be there anymore. We are enabling an
automatic way so this function will not have to be done manually any longer.

I want to thank those field techs that have tested the new release of NAD
and BITS. Without field accpetance tests of these programs we will
not get this program restarted. Keep genning and loading all the test slots 
you can. Even though BITS has another known problem (error code 51)
some other interesting points have come from your feedback.


I would like to hear from PMTS about genning and testing your interfaces
and FSC on validations and loading of diagnostics.

Thanks,

Prior to Carl Baltrunas departing for two weeks hard earned vacation time I 
want to call a program review meeting. Time is 2 pm to 3:30 pm on Tuesday 8 
August in conference room C5-645 (the usual place).

The purpose is to smooth the transition for the interim system support being
provided by Joe Smith (FSC) and Osman Guven (Neteng) in Carl's absence.

Beginning at 3:30 will be a report by D.Hopkins on his evaluation
of USECURE, a Unix security package. If you receive this message you're invited.

________________________________________________________________

Additional delay is apparent.  Present bits problems are the
only cause now.  I'll report more on present status later, but
first, I want to provide you with the framework on a migration
schedule once we begin migrations.
 
Week 1, Day 1 - Nodes 2127, 2143, 2146, 2167, 2207, 2211,
                2335, 2424, 2404, and 2407.
 
        Day 2 - Node Range 2011 - 2047.
 
        Day 3 - Node Range 2050 - 2125.
 
        Day 4 - Node Range 2126 - 2200.
 
        Day 5 - Node Range 2221 - 2342.
 
Week 2, Day 1 - First 100 nodes in the 2342 - 4000 range.
 
      Day 2-5 - 100 nodes per day.
 
Weeks 3 through 10 - 100 nodes per day, 500 per week.
 
After 10 weeks of migration, we shall turn-off systems
25, 54, and 33.
 
One week ahead of time, myself, with assistance from PI, will
announce the definative range of nodes to be converted, giving
7 days notice.
 
At least for the first 2 - 4 weeks, the only nodes that will be
converted are Public Net nodes located in the Continental U.S.
excluding nodes in Subnets, ACS, FSC, PMTS, and nodes with 
peripherals (disks and tapes).  Therefore, I urge those people
involved with customers and/or products on the (temporary)
exception list to think about and document your plans and
requirements to me so that we can look after our customers.
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
PRESENT STATUS - CK node, Look, Get, Unget and Put programs
are available for use.  A system banner message provides a 
pointer to a man page on how and when to use the utilities.
 


Please continue to test using present releases of NAD and
Bits - IT HELPS!  Also, the backup systems in Malvern are
installed and operational.  Please log into these systems
and test that they have the same "Look and Feel" as Fremont
and everything operates as it does on Fremont.

1. Malvern host numbers are 10655 and 10663.
2. MAN pages for prgrams are now in place.
3. Banner messages are now in place.

Points 2 and 3 were simply timing matters, my OnTyme was sent prior to this
work being done.

I understand we have had some problems with NETCOPY, thus the new release.
Are the present problems so crutical that we must take aplha code?

If so, then please distribute to the appropriate system locations including
Malvern.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.


                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.

                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommended that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    II.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            2.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                                 of this progress on the program.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.

                                 that this program is ready prior to
                                 restarting the project.  It is of
                                 critical importance.

                   Update: 8/8   Item complete.  C. Baltrunas instructed
                                 PI how to process update (name changed
                                 from backup) requests.  C. Baltrunas

                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are

                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.

                                 July.

                   Update: 8/4   Malvern disk controller fixed.  Disks
                                 formatted and directory structures set
                                 up.

                   Action: 8/8   J. Smith finalizing installation of
                                 Fremont System images.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.





                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

    VII.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.


    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on Usecure
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefullness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissable programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 exceute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

    IX.     Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

 


    X.      Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XI.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.

                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

                   Update: 8/4   A. -  Complete.
                                 B. -  Complete.
                                 C./D. Baltrunas - complete.
 
    XII.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release.

Hi Carl,


/suninfo/xcom.info.1 needs to be updated to note 
that (INTLTECH)DNIC.NOD on the PDP's has been 
copied to the xcompat directory on the SUNs and 
can be referenced as (XCOMPAT)dnic.301 or 
(XCOMPAT)dnic.403.

I would suggest removing xcom.info.1 entirely 
and replacing it with the above info, to avoid 
any confusion.


Thanks,


Rajan / Intl.

Subject: sun status 

As of this writing...
  nad 2.14  and bits 2.10  have been installed on all sun servers in
fremont and also on boomer.

  the x25 slots have been regenned for fremont, and of these, atlas and
gemini have been reloaded.  the difference is the removal of the call-cleared
patch and the inactivity timeout patch.  The line appears to be MUCH MUCH
improved over the response after patsy added the abovmentioned patches.

  we will re-install them later... one at a time to see what they affect...
we still want STS to be involved, and maybe have them re-install them and
test the differences by examining the packet-traces to see what's different
and why the circuit is unreliable in it's "prior" state.

  still needed for nad testing, verification of /pdp/tape10/* with /ntdlib/*
and then moving the files across..  I was expecting to do this tonight (thurs)
but other problems surfaced...

  problems: x25 kept dropping, reloaded gemini and atlas and it appears to
be stable... needs more research, help from STS, etc.

            catalyst, the 3/60 workstation in fremont, appears to half-boot
and then dies waiting for gemini to let it mount it's exported root.  I have
NO idea what is wrong... /tftpboot appears ok, the ethernet seems ok, the
files in /export/root/catalyst appear ok, /etc/bootparams seems ok, /etc/hosts
and /etc/networks seems ok... but catalyst wil not boot.   ** wasted an hour
trying different things, no luck...

   will be in about noon.  call me if you need me earlier.

PS:  I expect to vrify the /pdp/tape10 files between noon and the 2:00 meeting
and hope to have more to report then.

PPS: asked terry kane to have sun look at the xd4 and xd5 drives on flyer.

re: Field Queries

Thanks for addressing the request from Fremont and the patch update last
week. Here are two new ones that have come in the last few days that I'd like
you to respond to.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
	I wish to report that there are these problems in the Sun system:
 
 
   1)  If I delete the files from "Gemini", the deleted files will still exist 
       on "Titan";
 
   2)  If I create some files on "Titan", they won't show on "Gemini";
 
   3)  I am not able to use BITS to load node code on either "Gemini" nor
       "Titan", it works before;
 
   4)  The command "CP" only works if you copy files one by one, it is 
       impossible to copy a group of files from other directory to the present
       directory at one time(such as: 
 
       		> cp ../filename.* *.* 
	 
       it works before).
 
 
       When it's convenient, please let me know what happents.  Thaks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It has been observed that the various methods of doing directory
listings (ex. ls -l) do not show the year of the file creation.  If
this is changeable, please do.  It may not be important now, but
in the future, a year display can be vital.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.


                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

                   Update: 8/8   Bits release dated 8/8/89 failed.  NTD
                                 witnessed loads and made changes.

                   Update: 8/16  Bits release dated 8/16/89 failed.

                   Action: 8/17  UNIX team members will witness Bits
                                 testing in Netcon tonight.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.


                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommended that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/17  This change will take place after 24
                                 August.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release and so will observation
                                 of nodes failing to come up after Load.

                   Action: 8/8   NTD made a second release of Bits (2.10
                                 dated 8/8/89) to Program Management on
                                 Tuesday afternoon.  C. Baltrunas to
                                 install in Fremont on Tuesday evening.
                                 L. Reed to instruct Netcon to Load the
                                 ten (10) campus nodes, using Bits dated
                                 8/8/89 and report results.  Also, Netcon
                                 to do timing tests on same three nodes as
                                 was performed three (3) weeks ago.
                                 Report results to H. Matthews on 9
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/17  Alleged Bits speed improvements yet to be
                                 verified as last two Bits releases have
                                 not loaded nodes.  Furthermore, the
                                 report that some nodes do not come into
                                 Network after Bits loads remains
                                 unverified.


            C.   Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                 required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.

            D.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    II.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

                   Update: 8/17  Item Closed.



    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

                   Update: 8/17  Validations waiting signed individual
                                 security agreements before validating FSC

    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.
                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

    VII.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is


            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on USECURE
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefulness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissible programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 execute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

                   Update: 8/17  NTTR.

    IX.     Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.


                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.
 
    X.      Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XI.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Update: 8/17  Complete, item closed.

    XII.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release and loading problems are
                                 resolved.


   XIII.    J. Smith or O. Guven to train Netcon how to use the CKnode
            Program.  This will be scheduled prior to live migration.

SUBJECT>   New mass edit programs for CONSAT


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This memo documents the release of three new mass edit programs to
update the SOLO CONSAT and ISIS CONSAT command files and tymfiles.
All of these programs take as input a node number list file. The
following table lists the program name, function, and input file name:
 
    PROGRAM	     FUNCTION		     INPUT FILE NAME
    =======	     ========		     ===============
1. CMDSOL.SAV	MODIFIES SOLO COMMAND FILES    CMDSOL.DIR
2. TYSOL.SAV	MODIFIES SOLO TYMFILES	       CMDSOL.DIR
3. CMDSIS.SAV	MODIFIES ISIS CONSAT FILES     CMDSIS.DIR
 
Contact Abe Mendez for more information on the use of these programs
for the Tymnet nodes. Please do NOT use these programs without
checking with Abe first!!!
 
To run each program type RUN followed by the program name and press
the enter key; e.g for the solo consat :
 
		      RUN CMDSOL
 
will fire up CMDSOL.SAV, which will read node numbers from the
CMDSOL.DIR file. The CMDSOL.DIR file can contain a list of nodes like:
 
			 3106
                                                                Page  2

			 3144
 
The limit on the number of nodes is currently about 20,000.
 
Both CMDSOL and TYSOL share the same input file, CMDSOL.DIR. The
CMDSIS program requires a separate input file, CMDSIS.DIR .
 
These input lists can be used repeatedly for more modifications later
if we need them.  We can also move them to the UNIX environment later
as input files for the UNIX tools (yet to be developed).
 
I have tested the above 3 programs, and they work fine. They will not
damage already modified command files / tymfiles. Abe has
already used CMDSOL (the Solo Consat program) successfully.
 
Please call if you have further questions.
 
Best Regards,
 
K.L.Narayan

      II.   FAULT REPORTS

            2.A.1  Load Testing

                   Recent load testing has not helped to diagnose the
                   report that some nodes do not come up after BITS
                   load.  In fact, these tests have found some procedure
                   and training problems that are being addressed.  In
                   the meantime, the migration is delayed because some
                   nodes do not come up after loads from UNIX and Solo
                   Consats fail after loading.  NTD and R. Vivier are
                   investigating.

                   Action:  a) R. Vivier to resolve Solo Consat failures.
                            b) P. Whiteburst will have programmer in 
                               Netcon to personally conduct load tests
                               beginning on 5 September.
                            c) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  Either BITS does not have
                               this capability or it doesn't work.
                            d) H. Matthews to gain D. Murtaugh's agreement
                               to have NTD carry out Action Item (b).
                            e) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.
                            f) H. Matthews to provide Netcon the BITS
                               manual.



            B.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            2.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            2.B.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.   BITS 

            2.C.1  BITS testing this week show Load times in the 3-6 
                   minute range.  SUCCESS!  Thanks, P. Whitehurst and
                   A. Ko of NTD.

                   There are three related problems of unknown origin that
                   are presently being tested.  DLoading nodes genned and
                   loaded from UNIX; nodes not coming up after Bits Loads
                   and Loading slot codes in sequential order.

                   NTD believes they have a handle on these problems and
                   intend for a new Bits release on Thursday.

                   Update: 8/25  Testing shows no problem with DLoad.  NTD
                                 developer has been out sick so the 
                                 committed Thursday release was missed.
                                 P. Whitehurst reports that if we don't 
                                 get the new BITS releast today, we'll get
                                 it Monday.  This release will fix node
                                 startup problems.

                   Update: 8/31  See 2.A.1 but slow load times appear to
                                 have improved significantly.


   

            D.   NETCOPY

            2.D.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 8/25  P. Whitehurst to prepare another Netcopy
                                 release for today or Monday.

                   Update: 8/31  P. Whitehurst still required to deliver a
                                 new version of Netcopy.  We are running 
                                 an old release now.

            E.   X.25

            2.E.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommends that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/22  This change will occur after 24 August,
                                 even though changes are occurring to X.25
                                 now for change control reasons.

                   Update: 8/25  C. Baltrunas to re-implement the called
                                 clearned and link speed patches on Boomer
                                 and Gemini.

            F.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            2.F.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  P. Whitehurst to check on fix status.

                   Update: 8/25  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/31  P. Whitehurst will supply G. Walker with
                                 NSR number.  G. Walker will reply with
                                 status.



     III.   It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    PMTS is working right now to move all their code to
                   the UNIX systems.  Once completed, they'll compile
                   all code and report any assembly problems.  After
                   genning, it is strongly recommended this code is
                   loaded for testing.

            3.2    ACS requested the PASCAL compilers be installed on the
                   UNIX systems before they could begin testing.  This is
                   complete.

            3.3    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

                   Update: 8/17  Validations waiting signed individual
                                 security agreements before validating FSC
                                 on SUN Systems.

                   Action: 8/22  FSC has requested that directories named
                                 Engdiag and betadiag are set up on the
                                 UNIX Systems.  J. Smith to complete.

                   Update: 8/25  J. Smith cannot validate a user 
                                 directory.  This is a validations matter.

                   Update: 8/31  Engdiag and betadiag directories created.
                                 FSC validations are occurring.

                   Action: 8/31  It is R. Vivier's or FSC responsibility
                                 to move diagnostics to these directories,
                                 reassemble and test.

      IV.   Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

                   Update: 8/31  Issue dropped.




       V.   It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Update: 8/22  Validations is setting up hosts for all
                                 Fremont and Malvern hosts in the USERS
                                 profile.  For now, the first home is the
                                 PDP-10, in the next class position will
                                 be the SUN Server, where the personnel
                                 directory resides, the next three class
                                 positions will have another Fremont
                                 server, then the two Malvern servers.

                   Update: 8/31  Issue dropped.

      VI.   Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  Shall resume now.

     VII.   DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

                   Action: 8/22  Tests this week will call on the changed
                                 files to ensure the daily back-up is
                                 occurring properly.




                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            Present Public Net security elements are under review.  
            C. Fletcher to carry out this task.  C. Baltrunas and
            C. Fletcher to look at and recommend security implementations
            in the Private and Subnet code systems.

      IX.   Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

                   Update: 8/22  Thom Kelley working to develop another
                                 plan release after meeting with SUN and
                                 NTD.

       X.   Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

                   Update: 8/22  Delivered.  Under first draft review.

      XI.   J. Smith or O. Guven to train Netcon how to use the CKnode
            Program.  This will be scheduled prior to live migration.




     XII.   PUBLIC NET MASS FILE CHANGE REQUESTS

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

    XIII.   It is noted that there are some features of load that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

            2:00 p.m. Thursday 14 September C5-645.

      II.   FAULT REPORTS

            2.A.1  Load Testing

                   Recent load testing has not helped to diagnose the
                   report that some nodes do not come up after BITS
                   load.  In fact, these tests have found some procedure
                   and training problems that are being addressed.  In
                   the meantime, the migration is delayed because some
                   nodes do not come up after loads from UNIX and Solo
                   Consats fail after loading.  NTD and R. Vivier are
                   investigating.

                   Action:  a) R. Vivier to solve Solo Consat failures.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from R. Vivier

                            b) P. Whiteburst will have programmer in 
                               Netcon to personally conduct load tests
                               beginning on 5 September.

                   Update: 9/7   NTD scheduled for load tests tonight and
                                 tomorrow.  Tonight's load includes 14 
                                 nodes geographically dispersed including
                                 switchers and ISIS nodes.
 


                            c) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  Either BITS does not have
                               this capability or it doesn't work.

                   Update: 9/7   NTD development underway.

                            d) H. Matthews to gain D. Murtaugh's agreement
                               to have NTD carry out Action Item (b).

                   Update: 9/7   Murtaugh agrees.

                            e) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from L. Seltzer.

                            f) H. Matthews to provide Netcon the BITS
                               manual.

                   Update: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to release a BITS manual 
                                 via standard electronic release
                                 measures.  H. Matthews to inform
                                 D. Murtaugh when complete.

                            g) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

            B.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            2.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.




            C.   NETCOPY

            2.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 8/25  P. Whitehurst to prepare another Netcopy
                                 release for today or Monday.

                   Action: 8/31  P. Whitehurst still required to deliver a
                                 new version of Netcopy.  We are running 
                                 an old release now.

                   Update: 9.7   Due to experimental code in a Bubbnet SUN
                                 system, the new Netcopy release is 
                                 delayed until a more stable test 
                                 evironment is found.  Once this happens,
                                 Netcopy will be tested and released.

                 D.  X.25

            2.D.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommends that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Action: 8/25  C. Baltrunas to re-implement the called
                                 clearned and link speed patches on Boomer
                                 and Gemini.

                   Update: 9/7   C. Baltrunas to get appropriate passwords
                                 and carry out changes without further
                                 delay.

                   Action: 9/7   H. Matthews to contact D. Murtaugh to
                                 obtain formal mechanism for password
                                 updates.

            E.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                     reported a BBXS source bug.

            2.E.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  P. Whitehurst to check on fix status.


                   Update: 8/25  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/31  P. Whitehurst will supply G. Walker with
                                 NSR number.  G. Walker will reply with
                                 status.

                   Update: 9/7   NSR No. 3075.  G. Walker states this
                                 problem requires a source code fix,
                                 therefore NTD must make the change.

                   Action: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to escalate to BBXS
                                 development manager.

     III.   It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    PMTS is working right now to move all their code to
                   the UNIX systems.  Once completed, they'll compile
                   all code and report any assembly problems.  After
                   genning, it is strongly recommended this code is
                   loaded for testing.

                   Update: 9/7   PMTS has moved their code to the UNIX
                                 systems and performed test gens.  As a
                                 result, they have made an escalation and
                                 C. Baltrunas will review with PMTS.

            3.2    ACS requested the PASCAL compilers be installed on the
                   UNIX systems before they could begin testing.  This is
                   complete.

                   Update: 9/7   ACS has successfully test genned OnTyme
                                 code.

                   Action:  9/7  Test gen outdial and test load OnTyme
                                 code to a non-production system.

            3.3    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Update: 8/31  Engdiag and betadiag directories created.
                                 FSC validations are occurring.

                   Action: 8/31  It is NTS's responsibility to move
                                 diagnostics to these directories,
                                 reassemble and test.

                   Update: 9/7   NTS has been asked to move diagnostics to
                                 the UNIX systems and recompile.



      IV.   Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  Shall resume now.

       V.   DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S.

                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

      VI.   UNIX SECURITY

            Present Public Net security elements are under review.  
            C. Fletcher to carry out this task.  C. Baltrunas and
            C. Fletcher to look at and recommend security implementations
            in the Private and Subnet code systems.

     VII.   Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

                   Update: 8/22  Thom Kelley working to develop another
                                 plan release after meeting with SUN and
                                 NTD.


    VIII.   Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

                   Update: 8/22  Delivered.  Under first draft review.

      IX.   J. Smith or C. Baltrunas to train Netcon how to use the CKnode
            Program.  This will be scheduled prior to live migration.

       X.   PUBLIC NET MASS FILE CHANGE REQUESTS

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

      XI.   It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 9/7   Meeting arranged on 11 September with 
                                 NTD and Netcon.

SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  Nightly load tests shows a 64% completion rate
                   since late August when success rate was 25%.  The
                   migration will begin when load success rates exceed
                   90%.



        I.  NEXT MEETING - 2:00 p.m. Thursday 21 September C5-645.

       II.  FAULT REPORTS

            2.A.1  Load Testing

                   Recent load testing has not helped to diagnose the
                   report that some nodes do not come up after BITS
                   load.  In fact, these tests have found some procedure
                   and training problems that are being addressed.  In
                   the meantime, the migration is delayed because some
                   nodes do not come up after loads from UNIX and Solo
                   Consats fail after loading.  NTD and R. Vivier are
                   investigating.

                   Action:  a) R. Vivier to solve Solo Consat failures.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from R. Vivier

                   Update: 9/14  R. Vivier tested with different nodes and
                                 and found no problem.

                   Update: 9/14  Testing will resume once 6.35 Consat
                                 problems are resolved.



                            b) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  

                   Update: 9/7   NTD development underway.


                            c) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from L. Seltzer.

                   Update: 9.14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff.

                            d) H. Matthews to provide Netcon the BITS
                               manual.

                   Update: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to release a BITS manual 
                                 via standard electronic release
                                 measures.  H. Matthews to inform
                                 D. Murtaugh when complete.

                   Update: 9/14  P Whitehurst has released to NTD Program
                                 Management who will release to the 
                                 Production System.

                            e) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

            B.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            2.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.



                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.   NETCOPY

            2.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 8/25  P. Whitehurst to prepare another Netcopy
                                 release for today or Monday.

                   Action: 8/31  P. Whitehurst still required to deliver a
                                 new version of Netcopy.  We are running 
                                 an old release now.

                   Update: 9/7   Due to experimental code in a Bubbnet SUN
                                 system, the new Netcopy release is 
                                 delayed until a more stable test 
                                 evironment is found.  Once this happens,
                                 Netcopy will be tested and released.

                   Update: 9/14  Netcopy is released to Production System.

            D.  X.25

            2.D.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommends that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Action: 8/25  C. Baltrunas to re-implement the called
                                 clearned and link speed patches on Boomer
                                 and Gemini.

                   Update: 9/7   C. Baltrunas to get appropriate passwords
                                 and carry out changes without further
                                 delay.

                   Action: 9/7   H. Matthews to contact D. Murtaugh to
                                 obtain formal mechanism for password
                                 updates.

                   Update: 9/14  Password changes will be made available 
                                 so we can troubleshoot X.25. Furthermore,
                                 C. Baltrunas has implemented all X.25 
                                 changes as requested.



            E.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                     reported a BBXS source bug.

            2.E.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 9/7   NSR No. 3075.  G. Walker states this
                                 problem requires a source code fix,
                                 therefore NTD must make the change.

                   Action: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to escalate to BBXS
                                 development manager.

                   Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

     III.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            3.1    PMTS

                   Update: 9/7   PMTS has moved their code to the UNIX
                                 systems and performed test gens.  As a
                                 result, they have made an escalation and
                                 C. Baltrunas will review with PMTS.

                   Update: 9/14  C. Baltrunas reviewed PMTS NAD excalation
                                 and has passed onto NTD as it is a NAD
                                 bug.
                   Action: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned the escalation
                                 to her staff for debugging.

            3.2    ACS

                                 ACS should test in OnTyme on a production
                                 system.  Furthermore, ACS should clarify
                                 reason for Fortran 77 request.

            3.3    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

                                 FSC validations are occurring.

                   Action: 8/31  It is NTS's responsibility to move
                                 diagnostics to these directories,
                                 reassemble and test.

                   Update: 9/7   NTS has been asked to move diagnostics to
                                 the UNIX systems and recompile.

      IV.   LEMCOMS

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  Shall resume now.

       V.   DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S

                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

            Present Public Net security elements are under review.  
            C. Fletcher to carry out this task.  C. Baltrunas and
            C. Fletcher to look at and recommend security implementations
            in the Private and Subnet code systems.

     VII.   Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution

      IX.   Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

       X.   It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

9/21 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  Nightly load tests show a 64% completion rate
                   since late August when success rate was 25%.  The
                   migration will begin when load success rates exceed
                   90% over the period of 5 days.  The problems of load
                   hangs and nodes not coming coming up after reloads is
                   the main reason for migration delay, as it has been
                   for the last month.  Today, NTD has identified the
                   cause of one problem and can re-create the node hang
                   problem, therefore, fixes should be forthcoming.

      III.  FAULT REPORTS

            3.A.1  Load Testing

                           a) Recent load testing has not helped to
                              diagnose the report that some nodes do not
                              come up after BITS load.  In fact, these
                              tests have found some procedure and training
                              problems that are being addressed.  In the
                              meantime, the migration is delayed because
                              some nodes do not come up after loads from
                              UNIX and Solo Consats fail after loading. 

                   Update: 9/21  After installing a new X.25 patch, loads
                                 still fail.  Nodes do not come up after
                                 successful loads and loads hang in the
                                 middle of loading.  NTD identified a bug
                                 that stops nodes coming up and also can
                                 re-create the load hang problems, there-
                                 fore, fixes should be forthcoming.


                            b) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  

                   Update: 9/7   NTD development underway.

                            c) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from L. Seltzer.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                            d) H. Matthews to provide Netcon the BITS
                               manual.

                   Update: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to release a BITS manual 
                                 via standard electronic release
                                 measures.  H. Matthews to inform
                                 D. Murtaugh when complete.

                   Update: 9/14  P Whitehurst has released to NTD Program
                                 Management who will release to the 
                                 Production System.

                   Update: 9/21  Complete, item dropped.

                            e) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

            B.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            3.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.



                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.   NETCOPY

            3.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 9/14  Netcopy is released to Production System.

                   Action: 9/21  C. Baltrunas to install.

            D.  X.25

            3.D.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Action: 9/7   H. Matthews to contact D. Murtaugh to
                                 obtain formal mechanism for password
                                 updates.

                   Update: 9/14  Password changes will be made available 
                                 so we can troubleshoot X.25. Furthermore,
                                 C. Baltrunas has implemented all X.25 
                                 changes as requested.

                   Update: 9/21  X.25 back pressure patches implemented on
                                 9/18.  Load hang problem still present, 
                                 so is the problem where nodes do not come
                                 up after reload.

            E.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                reported a BBXS source bug.

            3.E.1  Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.

                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.
      IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            4.1    PMTS

                   Update: 9/7   PMTS has moved their code to the UNIX
                                 systems and performed test gens.  As a
                                 result, they have made an escalation and

      III.  FAULT REPORTS

            3.A.1  Load Testing

                           a) Recent load testing has not helped to
                              diagnose the report that some nodes do not
                              come up after BITS load.  In fact, these
                              tests have found some procedure and training
                              problems that are being addressed.  In the
                              meantime, the migration is delayed because
                              some nodes do not come up after loads from
                              UNIX and Solo Consats fail after loading. 

                   Update: 9/21  After installing a new X.25 patch, loads
                                 still fail.  Nodes do not come up after
                                 successful loads and loads hang in the
                                 middle of loading.  NTD identified a but
                                 that stops nodes coming up and also can
                                 re-create the load hang problems, there-
                                 fore, fixes should be forthcoming.

                   Update: 9/28  New BITS release to fix nodes not coming
                                 up.  NTD has retracked their claim that 
                                 load hangs can be recreated.  Another
                                 method to trap and identify this bug must
                                 be found.

                            b) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  

                   Update: 9/7   NTD development underway.


                            c) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from L. Seltzer.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                            d) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned   
                that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled 
                twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked 
                to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error 
                is reported.

            3.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.  NETCOPY

            3.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 9/14  Netcopy is released to Production System.

                   Action: 9/21  C. Baltrunas to install.

                   Update: 9/28  C. Baltrunas to completed by 9/29.


            D.  X.25

            3.D.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Action: 9/7   H. Matthews to contact D. Murtaugh to
                                 obtain formal mechanism for password
                                 updates.

                   Update: 9/14  Password changes will be made available 
                                 so we can troubleshoot X.25. Furthermore,
                                 C. Baltrunas has implemented all X.25 
                                 changes as requested.

                   Update: 9/21  X.25 back pressure patches implemented on
                                 9/18.  Load hang problem still present, 
                                 so is the problem where nodes do not come
                                 up after reload.

                   Update: 9/28  Issue dropped.

            E.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                reported a BBXS source bug.

            3.E.1  Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.

                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.

       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

              4.1  PMTS

                   Update: 9/7   PMTS has moved their code to the UNIX
                                 systems and performed test gens.  As a
                                 result, they have made an escalation and
                                 C. Baltrunas will review with PMTS.

                   Update: 9/14  C. Baltrunas reviewed PMTS NAD excalation
                                 and has passed onto NTD as it is a NAD
                                 bug.

                   Action: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned the escalation
                                 to her staff for debugging.

                   Update: 9/21  PMTS is half done testing of their 
                                 production slots in the Public Network.
                                 A. Martell reports 100% success.  
                                 Awaiting information from M. Marshall.
                                 All testing will be complete by October 
                                 1.



                   Update: 9/28  PMTS escalation shows a NAD bug that
                                 requires a NAD change.  This bug should
                                 have little impact on PMTS or other
                                 future NAD users.  PMTS changed things 
                                 for a near term work around solution.

              4.2  ACS 

                   Action:  9/7  Test gen outdial and test load OnTyme
                                 code to a non-production system.

                   Update: 9/14  ACS reports successful OnTyme code gen
                                 and load into a multi-meg lab engine.

                   Action: 9/14  ACS to gen and load outdial code.  Also,
                                 ACS should test in OnTyme on a production
                                 system.  Furthermore, ACS should clarify
                                 reason for Fortran 77 request.

                   Update: 9/21  ACS genned outdial code and determined
                                 that outdial source (PASCAL) requires
                                 modification.  ACS development is working
                                 on this and will look at all their
                                 requirements.

              4.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

              4.4  A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

              4.5  FSC 

                   Update: 8/31  Engdiag and betadiag directories created.
                                 FSC validations are occurring.

                   Action: 8/31  It is NTS's responsibility to move
                                 diagnostics to these directories,
                                 reassemble and test.

                   Update: 9/7   NTS has been asked to move diagnostics to
                                 the UNIX systems and recompile.

                   Update: 9/28  Diagnostics have not been moved to UNIX
                                 systems and recompiled yet because NTS
                                 has not signed the Security Agreement 
                                 yet.



        V.  LEMCOMS

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  

                   Update: 9/21  P. Whitehurst to instruct Field people
                                 to test gen and load LAMCOM under UNIX.

       VI.  DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S

                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

                   Update: 9/21  Item on hold, retesting will occur prior
                                 to migration.
      VII.  UNIX SECURITY

            Present Public Net security elements are under review.  
            C. Fletcher to carry out this task.  C. Baltrunas and
            C. Fletcher to look at and recommend security implementations
            in the Private and Subnet code systems.

     VIII.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.

                   Update: 9/21  First draft will be issued on 22 Sept.

                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

       IX.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.



        X.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 9/7   Meeting arranged on 11 September with 
                                 NTD and Netcon.

                   Update: 9/14  Meeting held.  NTD to produce a
                                 requirements document for Operations

                                 Tech Services.  J. Snavely and 
                                 H. Matthews satisfied with spec.
       XI.  SYSTEM OPERATIONS

           File backup (daily and monthly) procedures for the Production
           Systems are not working properly.

                   Action: 9/14  C. Fletcher and C. Baltrunas will revert
                                 back to a known good process and step
                                 forward until the fault is identified 
                                 and fixed.

                   Update: 9/21  C. Fletcher putting together training 
                                 programs and procedures to insure SUN

                                 properly.  He will re-implement use of
                                 U-backup once a systematic baseline is
                                 achieved. 

                   Action: 9/28  C. Fletcher performed selected partition
                                 dumps last Saturday.  Full operations
                                 training and documentation should be

tonights (Friday) goes as well we'll start the migration on Monday 16
October. The first nodes on Monday will be 2127, 2143, 2146, 2167, 2207, 2211
2335, 2424, 2404 and 2407. Day two is the node range 2011-2047. Day three
is the node range 2050-2125. Day four node range is 2126-2200. Day five (or
Friday October 20) is node range 2221-2342.

By close of business Monday I will have a more detailed letter covering
policies and procedures of the migration. I would like a conference call
on Tuesday or Wednesday after you've had time to read my message Monday to
cover any questions.

10/5 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  This week load testing shows success rates 
                        climbing above 70%.  A plan is in place to trap
                        the last known BITS bug. The migration will
                        start after the cause of this bug is found and a
                        fix is delivered, implemented and tested. The
                        time line could be as soon as 16 October, 
                        although I'll notify everyong directly in more
                        detail via OnTyme.

      III.  FAULT REPORTS

            3.A.1  Load Testing

                   Update: 10/5  A plan to trap the last known BITS bug
                                 is in place.  A BITS release on 9/28
                                 fixes the problem where nodes do not come
                                 up after reload.  This bug is the only
                                 remaining obsticle to beginning the
                                 migration.

                            b) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  

                   Update: 10/5  NTD delivered on 9/28 BITS release.  The
                                 method to escape the BITS load is to hit
                                 your UNIX excape character (usually CNTRL
                                 C).

                   Action: 10/5  L. Chavez to have Netcon verify this 
                                 works.

                            c) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                   Update: 10/5  Development underway.



                            d) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

            B.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned   
                that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled 
                twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked 
                to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error 
                is reported.

            3.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.  NETCOPY

            3.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 9/14  Netcopy is released to Production System.

                   Action: 9/21  C. Baltrunas to install.

                   Update: 9/28  C. Baltrunas to completed by 9/29.

                   Update: 10/5  Complete, item dropped.


            D.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                reported a BBXS source bug.

            3.D.1  Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.

                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.

       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

              4.1  PMTS

                   Update: 9/28  PMTS escalation shows a NAD bug that
                                 requires a NAD change.  This bug should
                                 have little impact on PMTS or other
                                 future NAD users.  PMTS changed things 
                                 for a near term work around solution.

                   Update: 10/5  A. Martell and A. Marshall report that 
                                 all PMTS production code has been 
                                 successfully genned and loaded.  PMTS is
                                 confident to migrate to UNIX once BITS is
                                 changed to allow multiple load users on
                                 separate passwords.

                                 T. Srukhosit is encouraged to attend 
                                 these meetings to explain the effects on 
                                 PMTS operations of the NAD bug.  NTD and
                                 PMTS will work closer to explain PMTS and
                                 problems so that NTD can fix.

              4.2  ACS 

                   Update: 9/21  ACS genned outdial code and determined
                                 that outdial source (PASCAL) requires
                                 modification.  ACS development is working
                                 on this and will look at all their
                                 requirements.

                   Update: 10/5  ACS reports that outdial code will not be
                                 modified to run under UNIX.

              4.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

              4.4  A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.



              4.5  FSC 

                   Update: 8/31  Engdiag and betadiag directories created.
                                 FSC validations are occurring.

                   Action: 8/31  It is NTS's responsibility to move
                                 diagnostics to these directories,
                                 reassemble and test.

                   Update: 9/7   NTS has been asked to move diagnostics to
                                 the UNIX systems and recompile.

                   Update: 9/28  Diagnostics have not been moved to UNIX
                                 systems and recompiled because NTS
                                 has not signed the Security Agreement 
                                 yet.

              4.6  LEMCOMS

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  

                   Update: 9/21  P. Whitehurst to instruct Field people
                                 to test gen and load LEMCOM under UNIX.

        V.  DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S

                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

                   Update: 9/21  Item on hold, retesting will occur prior
                                 to migration.

       VI.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.

      VII.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.



                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

     VIII.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

       IX.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 10/5  P. Whitehurst is assembling user comments
                                 into newly release requirements document.
                                 When complete, she'll call a document 
                                 review meeting to finalize the require-
                                 ments and place a delivery date on BITS
                                 4.00.

        X.  SYSTEM OPERATIONS

            File backup (daily and monthly) procedures for the Production
            Systems are not working properly.

SUBJECT:  UNIX MIGRATION
________________________________________________________________

 
Migrations of Public Network nodes will begin the evening of 
Monday, 16 October.  The last two known load bugs are solved.
The first was solved in a September 28th release where nodes
would not come up after loading.  The second bug was not in
Bits at all, but was caused by the absence of several X-25 
patches.  Three of the last four days testing shows 100%
first time load success which satisfied Operations acceptance
criteria.
 
I.   SCHEDULE
 
     Nodes will be loaded after 6PM PDT by Netcon.  Field C.S.
     must deliver code to the NetLoad directory on Saturn five
     (5) days (48 hours for the first week loads) prior to the
     scheduled time of the load.  PI will insure slot code for
     all slots is present and if so, will place the node on the
     load schedule.  If all slot codes are not present, PI will 
     escalate to P. Kiefer and the responsible Tech Manager.  If
     slot code is not present 48 hours after that, I will escalate
     to M. Lonergan.
 
     Because Bits uses the DLoad username to build node load
     circuits, Netcon is the only group or person allowed to load
     nodes from the UNIX systems.  A new release of Bits in December
     or January will fix this so others can load nodes with
     functionality similar to loadii.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
     16 October     2127, 2143, 2146, 2167, 2207, 2211, 2335,
                    2424, 2404, 2407.
     17 October     2011   to   2047
     18 October     2050   to   2125
     19 October     2126   to   2200
     20 October     2221   to   2342
     23 October     2342   to   2537
     24 October     2540   to   2721
     25 October     2722   to   3121
     26 October     3122   to   3306
     27 October     3307   to   3511
     30 October     3512   to   3704
     31 October     3705   to   4100
      1 November    4102   to   4370
      2 November    4371   to   4540
      3 November    4541   to   4660
 
     I will continue to publish schedules as appropriate, giving
     (7) days notice.  Using this schedule, I'll hope to turn off
     at least one PDP 10 by the end of the year.
 
II.  EXCLUSIONS         

     For various reasons, all Public Net nodes cannot be
     immediately converted.  This list documents the exclusions,
     their reasons, and a target date to migrate them.
 
     A.  Payment Systems   DLoad password    Mid-January 1990
 
     B.  Ontyme Systems    DLoad password    Mid-January 1990
 
     C.  Subnets           DLoad password    1Q90
 
     D.  FSC Lab Nodes     DLoad password    Mid-January 1990
 
     E.  Nodes outside continental U.S., MDSI not ready
                                             13 November
 
     F.  NetCon Nodes      Netcon Controls System
                                              13 November
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.  OTHER POINTS

     A.  Field C.S.'s shall copy personal directories from the
         PDP 10 to the UNIX systems.  The Tym and Tym5 
         directories are automatically copied each day.
 
     B.  BBXS 6.02 must be used; earlier versions of BBXS will
         not gen under UNIX NAD.
 
     C.  Anyone that wants an entire node loaded must call
         Netcon because password restriction of the DLoad
         username is mandatory.
 
     D.  If there is ever any question about which system (PDP or
         UNIX) the target node was genned on, the questioner
         should run "CKNODE (node no) (node no)" on the UNIX
         systems.  This program keeps track of nodes running under
         UNIX or under the PDP.  At no time should nodes be
         genned half UNIX, half PDP.  This will lead to confusion
         and possible downtime for customers.  Netcon, after a
         successful load, will update CKNODE once the node is
         converted to UNIX.  Once under UNIX, there is no return.
 
     E.  Definition of a Successful Load.
 
         1.  Node comes up with all slots.
             Slots do not have to be answered, but they have to
             show at least down or shut.  If they show down or
             shut, Netcon will open a ticket for the C.S.  If
             they do not show at all, Netcon will reload from
             the PDP and report a failed cutover attempt to me.
 
         2.  Node comes up with all T201 lines.
             If a T201 line does not come up, Netcon will open a 
             ticket for PI.  If the line that does not come up
             is a deadened node, Netcon will reload from the PDP
             and report a failed cutover attempt to me.
 
     To carry out the above plan, Netcon must probe snap every
     node before loading via UNIX.
 
     After meeting the above criteria, Netcon will update the
     CKNODE program and that node is deemed converted to UNIX.
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     F.  Problem Reporting.
 
         UNIX backup systems contain a mirror make of the
         primary systems (except NIB files).  If a primary
         system  is giving problems, users should log into
         the backup systems to do their work.
 
         Normal escalation procedures apply.  If the problem
         is deemed to be related to node code, ISIS or any
         other Tymnet interface escalate to STS.  If the
         problem is related to the UNIX system or 
         environment, escalate to *** Sunescal.  In an
         emergency, call CRAIG FLETCHER at X6250,  CARL
         BALTRUNAS at X6206, or myself at X6078.  Fremont
         Operations can page us in emergencies, too.
 
     G.  STS is responsible to put all authorized patches on
         the UNIX systems.  HTS is responsible to put all
         diagnostics on the UNIX systems.  NTD is responsible
         to move all Source and Beta Test to the UNIX systems.
 
         Should there be files or programs missing on the UNIX
         systems, contact the same people you would if these
         files were missing on the PDP, the responsible party.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


It is clear now that my message dated 6 October numbered M82652 RE Unix
migration did not contain as much detail as is required. One particular
area regards field C.S. submitting slot code for the nodes on the 
Unix migration schedule. 

When the schedule calls for node xxxxx to be converted on date YY the field
C.S. shall gen the target code on the Unix system. This code is what is
actually running in node at present and should not contain any changes. We ask 
that changes are not introduced at migration time because multiple
changes will make debugging more difficult if cutover of that node fails.

Furthermore, if the conversion fails (for whatever reason) reverting to the
PDP will be more difficult than without the change since the change was
probably only made on the Unix system. So please restrict introduction
of any change as the node is being converted. Once converted, normal code
maintenance may resume.

After the slot is genned the C.S. shall issue an "update" request (documentation
is in a man page title "update"). An update request is the Unix equivelent
of the PDP backup request. This request asks PI to take each slot code for 
the node to be migrated, assemble the code and place it on the load schedule.
Once the C.S. submits an update request and the node is converted to Unix, all
subsequent changes shall occur on the Unix system. An update request will 
deliver cXX, nXX, and and tXX files for that slot.

In the update request the C.S. MUST specify that the update request is for
                                                                Page  2

the Unix migration or a project. Initially, all update requests will be for  
the migration but once we get underway there will be projects that come along
in the normal course of events that require new slot code or node code. PI
needs to review each update request and act on them. PI's actions for migration
update requests and normal project update requests is different, therefore, we
ask that the C.S. specify (if fact, the update script prompts the user for this
information) what the update request is for.

I'm sure more bulletins will be required on these matters so until then...

In the last twenty four hours there was several escalations from field C.S.
that the backup process from the PDP TYM and TYM5 directories is not working.
In both instances it is proved that it is working but the confusion lies in
executing the NODE GET command. NODE GET must be told where to get the file
from. To get a file from the production directory you must tell GET to get
from production (/TYM/X/YYYYY) directory. Using the flexibility of UNIX when
executing GET files can come from your personal directory, NETLOAD, other 
directories or the production directory.

In both instances the right files are in the production directory and the C.S.
executed the GET command correctly. The only thing that wasn't done was
to tell the GET script where to go and get the files. If you don't tell GET to
go to the production directory it won't.

Please read the MAN pages on GET, PUT, GEN, LOOK and UNGET. These instruct how
to properly execute these programs. As always should questions arise use
*** SUNESCAL.

Field C.S. - please check the production directory prior to sumitting UPDATE
requests for the migration. This extra step takes little time and
insures all TYM and TYM5 files are copied to UNIX production. Secondly it
makes sure the most up to date code is loaded into the node on the night of
the migration.

I made a mistake in paragraph 4 Unix Bulletin No.1 Ontyme No. M82XXX. The 
sentence reads "(documentation is in a man page title 'update')". The man page
which outlines the update request in titled "node". I regret any problems this
may have caused you.

fr: Harry Matthews
re: Monday's Unix Load Schedule

As of 10 AM PDT today the following node slot files were missing for Monday
the 16th load schedule.

2127	slots 1 and 2
2143	slot 3
2146	slot 3
2167	slot 2
2207	slot 1
2211 	slot code is present dated 11 Aug but no update request
2335	same as n 2211
2424	slots 1 and 2
2404 	OK
2407	on original load schedule but removed because this node has a PSC
	slot. This node must wait till February for conversion.


Please deliver slot code as early Monday morning as possible for the missing 
slots so we can get these nodes converted Monday evening. 

NOTE: each slot code delivered must be delivered using the update command, 
we will use an automated program to extract missing slot code
which relies on submissions using update.

Also, nodes scheduled for load Tuesday night should already be
submitted. PI will check Monday and notify you of any missing codes.

10/12 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  UNIX migration begins Monday with 10 customer 
                         nodes because first time load success rates
                         exceed 90%.  It was up at 100% but a back-
                         pressure problem has lowered success rates,  
                         although  not low enough to stop migration.

      III.  FAULT REPORTS

            3.A.1  System Testing

               a)  Update: 10/12  After several days of 100% success 
                                  rate the backpressure problem has
                                  returned.  Recent implementation of X.25
                                  patches appeared to solve this but
                                  either they do not work or there is 
                                  another problem.  This problem does not
                                  appear to be in BITS but is either in
                                  SUNLINK or XCOM.  Even with this 
                                  problem, load success rates over the 
                                  last five days exceeds 90%.

                   Action: 10/12  R. Ferguson will arrange an FSC lab node
                                  to be available to send multiple loads 
                                  until the hang can be trapped.  Also,
                                  during the nightly load tests, Netcon 
                                  will call C. Baltrunas when a hang 
                                  occurs so he can troubleshoot.

               b)  NTD to add the capability to break out of a BITS load.

                   Update: 10/5  NTD delivered on 9/28 BITS release.  The
                                 method to escape the BITS load is to hit
                                 your UNIX excape character (usually CNTRL
                                 C).

                   Action: 10/5  L. Chavez to have Netcon verify this 
                                 works.

                   Update: 10/12 Item dropped.



               c)  L. Seltzer to get equivalent file capability working.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                   Update: 10/5  Development underway.

               d)  PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 5.33 node code
                   with 6.35 of Consat in tonight or tomorrow night's load
                   schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

            B.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned   
                that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled 
                twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked 
                to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error 
                is reported.

            3.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                reported a BBXS source bug.

            3.C.1  Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.


                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews trying for QA release by 
                                 10/13

       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

              4.1  PMTS

                   Update: 9/28  PMTS escalation shows a NAD bug that
                                 requires a NAD change.  This bug should
                                 have little impact on PMTS or other
                                 future NAD users.  PMTS changed things 
                                 for a near term work around solution.

                   Update: 10/5  A. Martel and M. Marshall report that 
                                 all PMTS production code has been 
                                 successfully genned and loaded.  PMTS is
                                 confident to migrate to UNIX once BITS is
                                 changed to allow multiple load users on
                                 separate passwords.

                                 T. Srukhosit is encouraged to attend 
                                 these meetings to explain the effects on 
                                 PMTS operations of the NAD bug.  NTD and
                                 PMTS will work closer to explain PMTS and
                                 problems so that NTD can fix.

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  Several 
                                 weeks of delay between problem escalation
                                 and troubleshooting had to do with lack 
                                 of effective communication.

              4.2  ACS 

                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

              4.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews nominated 16 November as the
                                 migration start date for these nodes.

              4.4  A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.


              4.5  FSC 

                   Update: 9/28  Diagnostics have not been moved to UNIX
                                 systems and recompiled because NTS
                                 has not signed the Security Agreement 
                                 yet.

                   Update: 10/12 FSC has requested changes in the was the
                                 diagnostics are copied over to the UNIX 
                                 systems in source directory because the 
                                 engdiag and betadiag directories are not
                                 created.

                   Action: 10/12 C. Baltrunas and R. Ferguson will meet 
                                 and discuss how to set up these 
                                 directories.  Also, R. Ferguson will 
                                 check with Validations on progress of FSC
                                 validations requests.

              4.6  LEMCOMS

                   Update: 9/21  P. Whitehurst to instruct Field people
                                 to test gen and load LEMCOM under UNIX.

                   Action: 10/12 P. Whitehurst to call Field Techs and
                                 schedule testing this week.

        V.  DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S

                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

                   Update: 9/21  Item on hold, retesting will occur prior
                                 to migration.

       VI.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.

      VII.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.



                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

     VIII.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

       IX.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 10/5  P. Whitehurst is assembling user comments
                                 into newly release requirements document.
                                 When complete, she'll call a document 
                                 review meeting to finalize the require-
                                 ments and place a delivery date on BITS
                                 4.00.

        X.  SYSTEM OPERATIONS

            File backup (daily and monthly) procedures for the Production
            Systems are not working properly.

                   Action: 9/28  R. Ferguson to reply on FSC preventitive
                                 maintenance policies and procedures for
                                 the SUN systems.

We didn't have a real good night last night regarding Unix loads. PI
submitted 39 nodes and 6 were completed. Nodes uncompleted are: 2015, 2017
2023, 2027, 2053, 2054, 2055, 2056, 2047, 2013, 2014, 2031, 2033, 2036, 2041
2042, 2032, 2026, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2051, 2062, 2063, 2065, 2067, 2070, 2072,
2070, 2073, 2105, 2106, 2125, 7154, and 4745. Completed nodes are updated in 
CKNODE.

Many of the failed nodes are either 5.33 switchers or 6.35 Consats, in
any event all the failed nodes are returned to service running PDP codes.

Ten failed nodes had too many passthroughs to reload, one node was already
down as a result of the earthquake, time did not allow nine nodes to be
reloaded, six succeeded, and there were 13 Unix related failures. 
Of the 33 failures, 60% can be attributed to the earthquake, therefore, 
we have to do more nodes tonight to catch up for the low amount the last
two nights. The 13 Unix related failures are a surprise. By Unix
related I define as relating to the new enviroment (Sun, Unix OS, file naming
conventions, new path mechanisms, and Bits). Eight of the thirteen
failed when Bits reported zero records received, two other problems were
appearently caused because Netcon could not access the servers, 
one node loaded but didn't come up, and Bits reported load failures with
new error messages.

Zero records recieved and server access failures appear to be procedural
problems since we haven't seen this report before and the servers were
operational throughout the night. Regardless of appearences we'll investigate
                                                                Page  2

these failures further. Nodes that failed to come after Bits loads was reported
fixed in a 9/28 release of Bits and our testing found this true. We'll
look at this again though, as well as the new error messages. 

To summarize, we'll investigate the failures and report back to you on our
findings and continue on schedule. Tonight we'll re-try last night
failures as well as load tonights scheduled node list.

Due to the number of CS's escalating problems for missing patch files I
announce a short delay for Isis slot and node migrations.  Appearently, STS
patches and NTD sources are available on Unix but the source patches are not.
We are taking steps right now to fix this by putting source patch files for
all products on the Unix systems via tape and electronic distribution methods. 

This delay only effects customer Isis slots, migration of 5.33 switcher code
will continue. Right now there is approximately 30 nodes in the network running
from Unix, 14 of these are customer nodes. Due to the absence of source patch
files problems may be experienced with these and Netcon is prepared to revert
back to the PDP as necessary.

I will contact everyone when slot code sysgens can resume. Hopefully,
this will be tommarrow and in the meantime I'll plan how to restart the 
migration in full.

I wanted to drop you this short note to let you know that Netcon successfully
converted 14 nodes to Unix last night (without failures) running 5.33 switcher 
code. Although the migration of customer ISIS nodes is delayed because of
the absence of source patch files, migration of switcher code continues since
we know all the files are present for this code.

We have looked very closely at the 33 failed conversion attempts on Wednesday
night and I have determined most of these to be procedural problems, not 
technical problems. Steps are implemented to solve these so I am confident that
the migration will resume in full next week.

The missing source patch files are on the Unix systems now. We are in 
the process of verifying file integrity, insuring we have all the necessary
files and we'll then distribute to the appropriate directory once we complete  
the task. Furthermore, steps are underway to insure that the Unix systems are 
updated using the same methods as exist today with the PDP's.

10/19 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  Due to the absence of source patch files on 
                         the UNIX systems, the migration of customer 
                         slots is delayed until we fix this.  Migration
                         of 5.33 switcher code will continue.  See OnTyme

            3.1  L. Seltzer to get equivalent file capability working.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                   Update: 10/5  Development underway.

            3.2  PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 5.33 node code
                 with 6.35 of Consat in tonight or tomorrow night's load
                 schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

                   Update: 10/19 5.33 switcher code is being deployed 
                                 during the migration.  6.35 Consat
                                 deployments are still delayed.

            3.3  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned   
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled 
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked 
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error 
                 is reported.

                   Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.



            3.4  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

                   Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.

                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews trying for QA release by 
                                 10/13

                   Update: 10/19 Code released 10/18, Technical Services
                                 will install by 10/20.  Item dropped.

            3.5  NETCON BOOT SCRIPT

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.


       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

              4.1  PMTS

                   Update: 9/28  PMTS escalation shows a NAD bug that
                                 requires a NAD change.  This bug should
                                 have little impact on PMTS or other
                                 future NAD users.  PMTS changed things 
                                 for a near term work around solution.

                   Update: 10/5  A. Martel and M. Marshall report that 
                                 all PMTS production code has been 
                                 successfully genned and tested.  PMTS is
                                 confident to migrate to UNIX once BITS is
                                 changed to allow multiple load users on
                                 separate passwords.

                                 T. Srukhosit is encouraged to attend 
                                 these meetings to explain the effects on 
                                 PMTS operations of the NAD bug.  NTD and
                                 PMTS will work closer to explain PMTS and
                                 problems so that NTD can fix.

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  Several 
                                 weeks of delay between problem escalation
                                 and troubleshooting had to do with lack 
                                 of effective communication.




              4.2  ACS 


                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

              4.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews nominated 16 November as the
                                 migration start date for these nodes.

                   Update: 10/19 Pacific Region has responded, no response
                                 from Europe yet.

              4.4  FSC 

                   Update: 9/28  Diagnostics have not been moved to UNIX
                                 systems and recompiled because NTS
                                 has not signed the Security Agreement 
                                 yet.

                   Update: 10/12 FSC has requested changes in the was the
                                 diagnostics are copied over to the UNIX 
                                 systems in source directory because the 
                                 engdiag and betadiag directories are not
                                 created.

                   Action: 10/12 C. Baltrunas and R. Ferguson will meet 
                                 and discuss how to set up these 
                                 directories.  Also, R. Ferguson will 
                                 check with Validations on progress of FSC
                                 validations requests.

              4.5  LEMCOMS

                   Update: 9/21  P. Whitehurst to instruct Field people
                                 to test gen and load LEMCOM under UNIX.

                   Action: 10/12 P. Whitehurst to call Field Techs and
                                 schedule testing this week.

        V.  DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S

                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

                   Update: 10/12 Process is working effectively, item 
                                 dropped.



       VI.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.

      VII.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.

                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

     VIII.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 10/19 C. Baltrunas will work with P. Michel to
                                 specify what are the exact requirements 
                                 so that Carl can write a script to auto-
                                 matically change Tym and Cmd files.

       IX.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 10/5  P. Whitehurst is assembling user comments
                                 into newly release requirements document.
                                 When complete, she'll call a document 
                                 review meeting to finalize the require-
                                 ments and place a delivery date on BITS
                                 4.00.

                   Update: 10/19 Requirements document is into the offices
                                 of J. Snavely and D. Murtaugh for formal
                                 acceptance.



        X.  SYSTEM OPERATIONS

            File backup (daily and monthly) procedures for the Production
            Systems are not working properly.

                   Action: 9/28  R. Ferguson to reply on FSC preventitive
                                 maintenance policies and procedures for
                                 the SUN systems.

                   Update: 10/19 Operator training is complete, another
                                 class is scheduled for 10/26.  Fremont 
                                 Operations is nearly ready to take on all
                                 aspects of SUN operations.  Furthermore, 
                                 outlines and initial test of a disaster 
                                 recovery plan is being developed.

Subject: yr msg. RE gen problems. 

Mike,

problem 1, if no files on 3400 slot one exist then let me ask a few questions
to try and determine why. 

a. name the date the slot was created
b. name the last time the slot was changed
c. when was the last PDP backup request submitted for this node.

If my suspicions are correct it was installed after early July '89 and has
not been changed since. If so, then I can see how the code wasn't moverd
to the Unix systems. Either way, I need asnwers to these questions.

What you should do to insure all your code is on the Unix systems ( I might
add that missing t and c files are the exception, most are there ) is to
perform a PDP 10 backup request. This moves the code from wherever it is to
the TYM and TYM5 directories on the PDP. When this happens it gets moved
to the unix production directories, too.

2nd problem: If you can send us a hardcopy we may be able to help
further on this, if not I am unsure what we can do for you. 



On either of the two probelms, the netcopy program will copy files from
the PDP to Unix, you can always use this to recover.

What has to happen now is:

1. PI (L.Reed) should regen all converted and pending conversion nodes
   that use 5.22 node code. Nodes already converted will not be reloaded. 
   The newly genned code should replace the old code in the production
   directory.

2. Netcon should reload the newly genned code when circumstances demand.

3. C.S.'s should regen their codes if they have any slots which were missing
   any of the above files. After regen submit an UPDATE request marked 
   "REGEN" and we'll place these on the load schedule.

Other information:

A. Sixty four nodes are converted to Unix and more occur each day. Before
   troubleshooting a node use CKNODE to determine where the production code
   is.

B. Customer ISIS node conversions will resume tonight. 5.33 switcher code
   code conversions continue.

Here is a handy tip to check which nodes are converted to Unix. Log into the
Unix systems and type:

			cknode -a | grep sun

This command gives you all nodes converted to Unix.

			cknode -a | grep mm/dd

This command gives you all nodes converted to Unix on a specific date. A
good use for the date arguement is to find out which nodes were converted
last night. Use this when you come in, first thing in the AM. You should be able
to tell from the node number if your customer was converted last night because
Netcon updates cknode right after a successful Unix cutover.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


It appears the original Unix migration schedule published 6 October is too
agressive. We have had great difficulties keeping up with it. For
example, by today we should have well over 200 nodes converted, in fact we
have 90. According to the original schedule we should be converting nodes in
the 2722 - 3121 range tonight. In an effort to maintain control of this and
get the migration running smoothly we'll not convert customer ISIS nodes
above node number 3121 (switchers will continue).

C.S's should continue to submit update requests, if you have not already done 
so, for ISIS nodes numbered below 3121. We'll catch up on the nodes numbered  
below 3121 prior to moving the migration forward past this number.

10/26 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  93 nodes are converted to UNIX.  The migration
                         is proceeding slower than planned but once we
                         resolve some procedural problems and re-publish
                         a new schedule, we'll resume a more agressive
                         schedule.

      III.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            3.1  SCHEDULE

                 A.  The first 7 days of migration shows that Netcon 
                     attempts to load 79% of the scheduled nodes and
                     77% of these attempted are completed first time.
                     These percentages are unsatisfactorily low, 
                     therefore, Netcon, PI and H. Matthews will meet
                     everyday at 8:30 a.m. to review the previous night
                     load schedule, completions and exceptions.
                     Exceptions will be reported to the Field.

                 B.  A new migration schedule will be published 27 
                     October.
                     
                   Action: H. Matthews

                 C.  PI will regen all nodes converted to UNIX that are
                     running 5.22 node code with missing patch files.  
                     These nodes will only be regenned, they'll not be 
                     reloaded until normal business requires.

                   Action:  H. Matthews to supply list of nodes to PI by
                            27 October.

                   Action:  PI to regen by 2 November.

                   Action:  Field CS's that have missing patch files from 
                            interface code should reload the slot 
                            individually and submit an update request
                            (per normal UNIX code maintenance procedures).

            3.2  L. Seltzer to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                   Update: 10/5  Development underway.

            3.3  PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 5.33 node code
                 with 6.35 of Consat schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

                   Update: 10/19 5.33 switcher code is being deployed 
                                 during the migration.  6.35 Consat
                                 deployments are still delayed.



            3.4  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned   
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled 
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked 
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error 
                 is reported.

                   Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            3.5  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

                   Update: 10/19 Code released 10/18, Technical Services
                                 will install by 10/20.

                   Update: 10/26 Code installed in beta test directory.
                                 Item dropped.

            3.6  NETCON BOOT SCRIPT

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.

       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

              4.1  PMTS

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  



              4.2  ACS 

                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

                   Update: 10/26 BBXS code released to beta test 
                                 directory.

              4.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews nominated 16 November as the
                                 migration start date for these nodes.

                   Update: 10/19 Pacific Region has responded, no response
                                 from European yet.

                   Update: 10/26 Pacific region obtaining UNIX 
                                 validations, Europe migration delayed 
                                 until 1Q90.

              4.4  FSC 

                   Action: 10/26 Diagnostics moved to SUN's and 
                                 R. Ferguson to test load this week.

              4.5  LEMCOMS

                   Action: 10/12 P. Whitehurst to call Field Techs and
                                 schedule testing this week.

        V.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.

       VI.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.



                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

      VII.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 10/19 C. Baltrunas will work with P. Michel to
                                 specify what are the exact requirements 
                                 so that Carl can write a script to auto-
                                 matically change Tym and Cmd files.

     VIII.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 10/5  P. Whitehurst is assembling user comments
                                 into newly release requirements document.
                                 When complete, she'll call a document 
                                 review meeting to finalize the require-
                                 ments and place a delivery date on BITS
                                 4.00.

                   Update: 10/19 Requirements document is into the offices
                                 of J. Snavely and D. Murtaugh for formal
                                 acceptance.

       IX.  SYSTEM OPERATIONS

            File backup (daily, weekly and monthly) procedures for the
            Production Systems.

                   Action: 9/28  R. Ferguson to reply on FSC preventitive
                                 maintenance policies and procedures for
                                 the SUN systems.

                   Update: 10/19 Operator training is complete, another
                                 class is scheduled for 10/26.  Fremont 
                                 Operations is nearly ready to take on all
                                 aspects of SUN operations.  Furthermore, 
                                 outlines and initial test of a disaster 
                                 recovery plan is being developed.



                   Update: 10/26 SUN servers on Diesel UPS system.  Every 
                                 Saturday night, a full system dump to 
                                 tape is taken and every Monday,
                                 incremental dumps are taken.  C. Fletcher
                                 to begin specifying procedures to operate
                                 the Malvern systems.

                   Update: 10/26 R. Ferguson will submit the FSC PM 
                                 policies next week.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



The attached schedule looks ahead one week for nodes that will be converted
to Unix and which day the load will be attempted. This schedule supercedes
all previous schedules and is designed to keep the conversions moving ahead
while adjusting our methods to a new ways of doing things.

I will publish new schedules on Thursday of each week for the upcoming week.
A schedule improvement is implemented to cope with nodes scheduled
but not converted for whatever reason. If a node is scheduled for conversion
on day X and is not converted it will automatically be rescheduled for
another conversion attempt in 7 calender days. For example, if node 2010
is scheduled for conversion on Tuesday and the conversion fails it will
be placed on the next week schedule for a Tuesday conversion. This is
an effective way to keep everyone informed so that everyone can inform their
customers and we can manage the information better.

P.I. is checking right now for the update submissions for all nodes scheduled
for tonight thru Tuesday, and will be sending an OnTyme today asking
for any slot code which is missing. Please check if you have slots on these 
nodes and submit update requests quickly.

TThis schedule covers Unix migration nodes for the following period:
 
11/3 Friday - 2157 2163 2166 2040 2035 2026 3134
11/4 Saturday - 2052 2177 3131 2023 2155 2063
11/6 Monday - 2462 2260 2220 2206
11/7 Tuesday - 3404 3407 2074 2216 2212 2217 2220 2221 2223 2224 2471 2500 
               2074 2210
11/8 Wednesday - 2145 2226 2230 2237 2241 2244 2245 2247
11/9 Thursday - 6335 6351 7456 2251 2252 2253 2254 2255 2256 2257 2260 2261 
                2264 2265 2266 2267
 
 
Some of these nodes are re-scheduled from last week when they failed 
conversion for various reasons, lets make all efforts to see that we adhere to 
this schedule, it is small enough.
 
You will notice a format change to this schedule. No longer am I publishing a 
range for conversion but rather all the exact node numbers. Given all of our 
past performance against published schedules I am forced to revert to explicit 
nodes on a day by day basis. Hopefully, I'll be able to schedule in ranges 
once some of the present difficulties are worked out. Since I am publishing 
the explicit node numbers for each day and you can check load status the 
morning after the load with CKNODE, I will no longer publish daily exception 
reports.

Subject: Using the TAR program on the DEC-2020. 

Since TITO writes 36-bit binary data, tapes written by TITO can only be
read by another PDP-10.  No Unix system can read them.

Carl Baltrunas wrote a program to write tapes in a format that is readable
by Unix systems.  It's in (SYS)TAR.SAV and you can type "HELP TAR" for info.
TAR is what we use to transfer TYM and CMD files from the PDP-10s to our
Sun systems.

       II.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            2.1  SCHEDULE
 
                 A.  PI will regen all nodes converted to UNIX that are
                     running 5.22 node code with missing patch files.  
                     These nodes will only be regenned, they'll not be 
                     reloaded until normal business requires.

                   Action:  H. Matthews to supply list of nodes to PI by
                            27 October.

                   Action:  PI to regen by 2 November.

                   Action:  Field CS's that have missing patch files from 
                            interface code should reload the slot 
                            individually and submit an update request
                            (per normal UNIX code maintenance procedures).

            2.2  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 10/05 Development underway, fix will be
                                 retro-fitted to present Bits version.

            2.3  PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 5.33 node code
                 with 6.35 of Consat schedule.

                   Update: 10/19 5.33 switcher code is being deployed 
                                 during the migration.  6.35 Consat
                                 deployments are still delayed.

            2.4  Failed Loads

                 A. Bits hang, another failure occured last night on a
                    a server with the X.25 patches installed.
 
                   Action: 11/02 C. Baltrunas to escalate to STS.
 
                 B. Nodes not coming up, Netcon will instruct FSC to take a 
                    console reading (including light bar) and will take a dump 
                    to the Unix systems and escalate to NTS.
 
            2.5  NAD Bug, last night an obscure NAD bug was discovered 
                 during an unattended batch job that filled up the server 
                 Delta until it was no longer able to process logins. 
                 Since Delta was full, NFS was very slow and login requests 
                 to the other servers were processed very slowly. Delta was
                 recycled and access problem is resolved. 
 
                   Action: 11/02 Fault reported to NTD for resolution.
 
            2.6  NETCON BOOT SCRIPT

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.

      III.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            3.1  PMTS

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  

            3.2  ACS 

                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

                   Update: 10/26 BBXS code released to beta test 
                                 directory.

            3.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                 contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                 United States and are under control of the Public
                 Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews nominated 16 November as the
                                 migration start date for these nodes.

                   Update: 10/19 Pacific Region has responded, no response
                                 from European yet.

                   Update: 10/26 Pacific region obtaining UNIX 
                                 validations, Europe migration delayed 
                                 until 1Q90.

            3.4  FSC 

                   Action: 10/26 Diagnostics moved to SUN's and 
                                 R. Ferguson to test load this week.

            3.5  LEMCOMS

                   Action: 10/12 P. Whitehurst to call Field Techs and
                                 schedule testing this week.

                   Update: 11/03 A Lemcom is scheduled for tests tonight.

       IV.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/05 H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.
 
                   Update: 11/02 W.Bartlett preparing recommendation paper
                                 that is intended to get resources assigned
                                 to implement actions to resolve these 
                                 issues.        

        V.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 09/14 H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.

                   Update: 09/28 Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

       VI.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 10/19 C. Baltrunas will work with P. Michel to
                                 specify what are the exact requirements 
                                 so that Carl can write a script to auto-
                                 matically change Tym and Cmd files.

      VII.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 11/02 Scheduled delivery date 6 February '90.

     VIII.  SYSTEM OPERATIONS

            File backup (daily, weekly and monthly) procedures for the
            Production Systems.

                   Action: 09/28 R. Ferguson to reply on FSC preventitive
                                 maintenance policies and procedures for
                                 the SUN systems.

                   Update: 10/19 Operator training is complete, another
                                 class is scheduled for 10/26.  Fremont 
                                 Operations is nearly ready to take on all
                                 aspects of SUN operations.  Furthermore, 
                                 outlines and initial test of a disaster 
                                 recovery plan is being developed.

                   Update: 10/26 SUN servers on Diesel UPS system.  Every 
                                 Saturday night, a full system dump to 
                                 tape is taken and every Monday,
                                 incremental dumps are taken.  C. Fletcher
                                 to begin specifying procedures to operate
                                 the Malvern systems.

                   Update: 11/02 R. Ferguson delivered the FSC PM policies.

Some of these nodes are re-scheduled from last week when they failed 
conversion for various reasons and many of the nodes were scheduled for 
November 2nd and 3rd. I will by the end of the week put forth a schedule 
for node conversions beginning on Friday the 17th at which point I hope I can 
always work seven days in advance of the load date.

11/09 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  145 nodes are UNIX converted.  Conversion
                         failures where nodes crash or don't come up
                         traced to Solo Consats.  Migration of this
                         software is stopped until a solution is found.


        I.  NEXT MEETING - 2:00 P.M. Thursday 16 November C5-645.

       II.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            2.1  SCHEDULE 

                 A.  PI will regen all nodes converted to UNIX that are 
                     running 5.22 node code with missing patch files.
                     These nodes will only be regenned, they'll not be
                     reloaded until normal business requires.

                   Update: 11/09 Original regen date was missed, will be 
                                 completed by 14 November.

                   Action:  Field CS's that have missing patch files from
                            interface code should reload the slot
                            individually and submit an update request
                            (per normal UNIX code maintenance procedures).

            2.2  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 10/05 Development underway, fix will be
                                 retro-fitted to present Bits version.



            2.3  PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 5.33 node code 
                 with 6.35 of Consat schedule.

                   Update: 10/19 5.33 switcher code is being deployed
                                 during the migration.  6.35 Consat
                                 deployments are still delayed.

                   Update: 11/09 Consat 6.35 codes in final stage of
                                 development, once it is moved to the
                                 Public Net systems we'll begin UNIX
                                 migration of Solo Consats using this 
                                 code.

            2.4  Failed Loads

                 A.  Bits hang, another failure occurred last night on a
                     server with the X.25 patches installed.

                   Action: 11/02 C. Baltrunas to escalate to STS.

                   Update: 11/09 STS has delivered new patches,
                                 C. Baltrunas to install.

                 B.  Nodes not coming up, Netcon will instruct FSC to take
                     a dump to the UNIX systems and escalate to NTS.

                   Update: 11/09 Most of these faults have occurred on 
                                 Solo Consat cide, therefore, Solo Consat
                                 is delayed until either NAD is fixed or
                                 6.35 ISIS Consat is ready.

            2.5  NAD Bug, last night an obscure NAD bug was discovered
                 during an unattended batch job that filled up the server
                 Delta until it was not longer able to process logins.
                 Since Delta was full, NFS was very slow and login 
                 requests to the other servers were processed very slowly.
                 Delta was recycled and access problem is resolved.

                   Action: 11/02 Fault reported to NTD for resolution.

            2.6  NETCON BOOT SCRIPT

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.

      III.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            3.1  PMTS

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  



            3.2  ACS 

                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

                   Update: 10/26 BBXS code released to beta test 
                                 directory.

            3.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                 contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                 United States and are under control of the Public
                 Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/26 Pacific region obtaining UNIX 
                                 validations, Europe migration delayed 
                                 until 1Q90.

                   Update: 11/09 Pacific Region not ready to begin 
                                 migration yet.  Jeff Oliveto will assist
                                 them to prepare for migration.

            3.4  FSC 

                   Action: 10/26 Diagnostics moved to SUN's and 
                                 R. Ferguson to test load this week.

                                 Complete employee validations.
            3.5  LEMCOMS

                   Action: 10/12 P. Whitehurst to call Field Techs and
                                 schedule testing this week.

                   Update: 11/09 A Lemcom slot in Dallas is UNIX converted
                                 under test, no reported problems.

       IV.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.

                   Update: 11/02 W. Bartlett preparing recommendation 
                                 paper that is intended to get resources
                                 assigned to implement actions to resolve
                                 these issues.



        V.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.

                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

       VI.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 10/19 C. Baltrunas will work with P. Michel to
                                 specify what are the exact requirements 
                                 so that Carl can write a script to auto-
                                 matically change Tym and Cmd files.

      VII.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 11/02 Scheduled delivery date 6 February '90.

Attached is present Unix migration information. The alarming trend is the
huge increase in missing slots. In the last 7 days there were 24 nodes with
slots missing, some of these nodes had multiple missing slots. Lets all make 
extra effort to improve.

Another area which should see immediate improvement is meeting the schedule.
There have been some staff allocation problems which have been resolved
and resolution will be measured to judge improvements.  For example,
there has been 100% success in the last three night load schedules.

Finally, I want to announce the near term goal for the Public Network
Unix migration is to turn off one PDP-10 by the end of the year. In order to
do this we must get nearly 2000 nodes (decimal) converted. We only need to  
average 45 nodes per day and when we get rolling I am confident we can 
achieve a nightly load rate of 50 to 70 nodes. In order to do this two
problem areas need to be solved: submitting slot code and genning
the nodes against the schedule. 

Lets work together.

11/16 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  191 nodes are UNIX converted.  The schedule
                         is not being met because of employee absences
                         in PI and Field not submitting slot codes.
                         Measureable improvements must be observable in
                         the next two weeks in order to meet the near
                         term goal of turning off one PDP-10 by year end.
                         I have made new, improved working relationships
                         with PI to improve this area.  All Field Tech
                         Managers must see that their people submit the 
                         slot code on time. 


        I.  NEXT MEETING - 2:00 P.M. Thursday 30 November C5-645.

       II.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            2.1  SCHEDULE 

                 A.  PI will regen all nodes converted to UNIX that are 
                     running 5.22 node code with missing patch files.
                     These nodes will only be regenned, they'll not be
                     reloaded until normal business requires.

                   Update: 11/09 Original regen date was missed, will be 
                                 completed by 14 November.

                   Action:  Field CS's that have missing patch files from
                            interface code should reload the slot
                            individually and submit an update request
                            (per normal UNIX code maintenance procedures).

            2.2  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 10/05 Development underway, fix will be
                                 retro-fitted to present Bits version.


            2.3  PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 5.33 node code 
                 with 6.35 Consat on schedule.

                   Update: 11/09 Consat 6.35 codes in final stage of
                                 development, once it is moved to the
                                 Public Net systems we'll begin UNIX
                                 migration of Solo Consats using this 
                                 code.

            2.4  Failed Loads

                 A.  Bits hang, another failure occurred last night on a
                     server with the X.25 patches installed.

                   Action: 11/09 STS has delivered new patches,
                                 C. Baltrunas to install.

                   Action: 11/16 STS working with SUN to trap the "call
                                 reset" problem.

                 B.  Nodes not coming up, Netcon will instruct FSC to take
                     a dump to the UNIX systems and escalate to NTS.

                   Update: 11/09 Most of these faults have occurred on 
                                 Solo Consat cide, therefore, Solo Consat
                                 is delayed until either NAD is fixed or
                                 6.35 ISIS Consat is ready.

            2.5  NAD BUGS

                 1) Appending symbol tables
                 2) Solo Consats
                 3) PMTS
                 4) Debugging RFI's
                 5) NAD bug observed during unattended batch job
                    when a circuit was built but never completed

                   Update: 11/17 A new release of NAD is now in QA that 
                                 fixes above problems 1, 2 and 3.  This
                                 code will be released to Public Net once
                                 NAD passes QA test configuration.

                                 Debugging RFI's, please send hardcopy to
                                 SUNESCAL.

            2.6  NETCON BOOT SCRIPT

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.

      III.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            3.1  PMTS

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  



            3.2  ACS 

                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

                   Update: 10/26 BBXS code released to beta test 
                                 directory.

            3.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                 contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                 United States and are under control of the Public
                 Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/26 Pacific region obtaining UNIX 
                                 validations, Europe migration delayed 
                                 until 1Q90.

                   Update: 11/09 Pacific Region not ready to begin 
                                 migration yet.  Jeff Oliveto will assist
                                 them to prepare for migration.

            3.4  FSC 

                   Action: 10/26 Diagnostics moved to SUN's and 
                                 R. Ferguson to test load this week.

                                 Complete employee validations.
            3.5  LEMCOMS

                   Update: 11/09 A Lemcom slot in Dallas is UNIX converted
                                 under test, no reported problems.

                   Update: 11/16 Test is performing well, running 
                                 production traffic.

       IV.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.

                   Update: 11/02 W. Bartlett preparing recommendation 
                                 paper that is intended to get resources
                                 assigned to implement actions to resolve
                                 these issues.



        V.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.

                   Update: 11/16 This has moved forward slowly due to
                                 complexity, cross departmental issues
                                 and lack of Management attention.  A
                                 member of Al Fenn's staff is now chairing
                                 the matter and improvement in meeting 
                                 this deliverable should be more visible
                                 soon.

       VI.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 10/19 C. Baltrunas will work with P. Michel to
                                 specify what are the exact requirements 
                                 so that Carl can write a script to auto-
                                 matically change Tym and Cmd files.

      VII.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 11/02 Scheduled delivery date 6 February '90.

The nodes scheduled for Friday night 17 November and Saturday night 18 
November are nodes which were not attempted conversion earlier this week or 
were not converted in the last couple weeks, therefore, there aren't any new 
nodes till Monday. We'll start slowly then because I haven't given you much 
notice (my apologies) and there is a new PI specialist assigned to Unix - 
Micheal Erickson - and he'll need some time to ramp up to speed, too. No loads 
are scheduled thru Thanksgiving holidays since this is the time period of 
Tymnet's largest traffic volumes and Monday the 27th will give everyone time 
to get their feet on the ground after the holidays to ramp up the project.
 
Beginning the 28th we'll be shooting for nearly 40 node loads per night and 
this will increase as much as possible to achieve the near term goal of 
turning one Public Net code gen PDP10 off by year end. 
 
Please review this list and notify me if any Payment Systems, OnTyme, 
International, Subnet or Pascal nodes are on the schedule, because they 
shouldn't be.

I spoke to you about the possibility of installing  a Sun Server
in building C, ground floor. Now I am certain that we should do this and
would like to sit down with you and Craig Fletcher and Joe Smith to determine
what we need to do. Please contact me so we can arrange a meeting time.

ATTENDEES:  C. Baltrunas, W. Burstein, L. Chavez, C. Fletcher, 
            H. Matthews, J. Smith, P. Whitehurst, 

11/30 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  1) 329 nodes are UNIX converted.  2000 to go
                            to meet the 1989 goal of shutting down one 
                            Public Net PDP 10.
                         2) After a node is converted to UNIX, the code
                            from the PDP 10 Tym and Tym 5 directories 
                            will be removed to a hidden location.  This
                            is done for all 329 nodes that are migrated, 
                            and will continue to be done as the migration
                            proceeds.
                         3) A UNIX "learn" program is being put on the
                            Public Net code gen system - watch for an
                            availability announcement.
                         4) New release of BITS and NAD this week which
                            should solve loading and debugging problems.

        I.  NEXT MEETING - 2:00 P.M. Thursday 7 December C5-645.

       II.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            2.1  SCHEDULE 

                 A.  PI will regen all nodes converted to UNIX that are 
                     running 5.22 node code with missing patch files.
                     These nodes will only be regenned, they'll not be
                     reloaded until normal business requires.

                   Update: 11/09 Original regen date was missed, will be 
                                 completed by 14 November.

                   Action:  Field CS's that have missing patch files from
                            interface code should reload the slot
                            individually and submit an update request
                            (per normal UNIX code maintenance procedures).

                   Update: 11/30 Regen complete.  Item closed.



            2.2  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 10/05 Development underway, fix will be
                                 retro-fitted to present Bits version.

                   Update: 11/30 NTD targets a release of BITS with this
                                 capability to QA by 12/15.

            2.3  PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 5.33 node code 
                 with 6.35 Consat on schedule.

                   Update: 11/09 Consat 6.35 codes in final stage of
                                 development, once it is moved to the
                                 Public Net systems we'll begin UNIX
                                 migration of Solo Consats using this 
                                 code.

                   Update: 11/30 Consat upgrades are now being migrated to
                                 UNIX.  Item closed.

            2.4  Failed Loads

                 A.  Bits hang, another failure occurred last night on a
                     server with the X.25 patches installed.

                   Action: 11/09 STS has delivered new patches,
                                 C. Baltrunas to install.

                   Action: 11/16 STS working with SUN to trap the "call
                                 reset" problem.

                   Update: 11/30 Problem Fixed.  Item dropped.

                 B.  Nodes not coming up, Netcon will instruct FSC to take
                     a dump to the UNIX systems and escalate to NTS.

                   Update: 11/09 Most of these faults have occurred on 
                                 Solo Consat loads, therefore, Solo Consat
                                 is delayed until either NAD is fixed or
                                 6.35 ISIS Consat is ready.

                   Update: 11/30 Seet item 2.3 and 2.5; item closed.

            2.5  NAD BUGS

                 1) Appending symbol tables
                 2) Solo Consats
                 3) PMTS
                 4) Debugging RFI's
                 5) NAD bug observed during unattended batch job
                    when a circuit was built but never completed

                   Update: 11/17 A new release of NAD is now in QA that 
                                 fixes above problems 1, 2 and 3.  This
                                 code will be released to Public Net once
                                 NAD passes QA test configuration.

                                 Debugging RFI's, please send hardcopy to
                                 SUNESCAL.



                   Action: 11/30 H. Matthews to learn when this release 
                                 will occur.

            2.6  NETCON BOOT SCRIPT

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.

                   Update: 11/30 The reason this script fails to operate 
                                 is UNIX NAD does not support switching 
                                 between command and interactive nodes.
                                 This is an explanation why some debugging
                                 scripts used on the PDP don't work, or 
                                 need modification, under UNIX.

      III.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            3.1  PMTS

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  

            3.2  ACS 

                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

                   Update: 10/26 BBXS code released to beta test 
                                 directory.

            3.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                 contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                 United States and are under control of the Public
                 Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/26 Pacific region obtaining UNIX 
                                 validations, Europe migration delayed

       IV.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source, and access controls.

                   Update: 11/02 W. Bartlett preparing recommendation 
                                 paper that is intended to get resources
                                 assigned to implement actions to resolve
                                 these issues.

        V.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 11/30 A sub project is underway to modify 
                                 Tymnet information process so that all
                                 software shipments from the UNIX systems
                                 is initiated via the OES.

       VI.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 10/19 C. Baltrunas will work with P. Michel to
                                 specify what are the exact requirements 
                                 so that Carl can write a script to auto-
                                 matically change Tym and Cmd files.



      VII.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 11/02 Scheduled delivery date 6 February '90.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Thanks for your messages RE slow response loading Turbo. Let me just say there 
is no appearent evidence in your messages that show me it is Bits related. I 
have talked to Ron Vivier, who is more knowledgeable on Turbo, and he reports 
that yes, it takes more time to load Turbo Engines than regular Engines. The 
reason is when you execute a Turbo load you are loading much more data. 
Furthermore, if you are seeing a slower than normal (normal means time it 
takes to load regular Engines) time to load a Turbo from Bubbnet servers 
(OPUS, ANTARES) and Public Net servers it further proves that the target is 
the only common component.
 
Bits was slow in July but NTD improved this to now it is just about the speed 
of LOADII. Netcon reports that if you watch a Bits load closely you'll notice 
that it appears a little slower than LOADII but the difference is small. In 
fact, it is so small that Netcon reports satisfaction with Bits load times.
 
The Public Net is running V2.11 Bits which fixes Solo Consat loading problems 
and one other problem (incorrect CTA table). Bubbnet servers may be running a 
earlier version but I don't think this makes any difference since Bits slow 
load times problems were fixed months ago and Bubbnet has been upgraded since 
then. The Public Net servers are connected to Tymnet with 56KB X.25 links. I 
have no knowledge how Bubbnet servers are interfaced and which speed the 
gateway runs at. 
 
You should talk to some technically knowledgeable people on the Turbo project 
team to get a better feel for loading Turbos, also Pam Whitehurst is the 
development manager for Bits and she can offer some guidance and someone who 
runs Bubbnet should be able to advise their configuration, as well.

SUBJECT:  UNIX Migration Program Review Meeting No. 7


    I.      NEXT MEETING

            3:00 p.m. Friday 25 August C5-645.

    II.     FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            2.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            2.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed


                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

    B.      BITS 

            2.B.1  Bits testing this week show Load times in the 3-6 
                   minute range.  SUCCESS!  Thanks, P. Whitehurst and
                   A. Ko of NTD.

                   There are three related problems of unknown origin that
                   are presently being tested.  DLoading nodes genned and
                   loaded from UNIX; nodes not coming up after Bits Loads
                   and Loading slot codes in sequential order.

                   NTD believes they have a handle on these problems and
                   intend for a new Bits release on Thursday.

    C.      NAD

            2.C.1  Two open escalators to NTD.  One is a question:  how to
                   stop extended DOT display.  The next appears to be a
                   fault:  ? hist command zaps DOT circuit.

    D.      NETCOPY

            2.D.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

    E.      X.25

            2.E.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommends that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/22  This change will occur after 24 August,
                                 even though changes are occurring to X.25
                                 now for change control reasons.

            F.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            2.F.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.





                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  P. Whitehurst to check on fix status.

            G.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            2.G.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  S. Spinale to provide an update on PMTS
                                 progress.  No report on migration access
                                 from ACS.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.



            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

                                 security agreements before validating FSC
                                 on SUN Systems.

                   Action: 8/22  FSC has requested that directories named
                                 Engdiag and betadiag are set up on the
                                 UNIX Systems.  J. Smith to complete.

    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Update: 8/22  Validations is setting up hosts for all
                                 Fremont and Malvern hosts in the USERS
                                 profile.  For now, the first home is the
                                 PDP-10, in the next class position will
                                 be the SUN Server, where the personnel
                                 directory resides, the next three class
                                 positions will have another Fremont
                                 server, then the two Malvern servers.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.



                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  Shall resume now.

    VII.    DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

                   Action: 8/22  Tests this week will call on the changed
                                 files to ensure the daily back-up is
                                 occurring properly.

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefulness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissible programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 execute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release

The number of nodes being migrated each day is steadily increasing. I 
attribute this to a certification of the technology of choice (Unix, Sun) and 
the replacement programs (Unix NAD and BITS) and, most importantly, the people 
involved in the project gaining familiarity and confidence working in the new 
enviroment. 
 
Later this week the project schedule calls that we ramp up to 100 nodes 
migrated per night, and the schedule for the week beginning 20 December (to be 
issued later today) will have more than 100 nodes per night. The schedule is 
agressive in order to meet the near term goal of turning off one Dallas based 
PDP-10 by year end, system 25 to be exact. In order to achieve this goal, and 
it is acheiveable, we must adhere to the schedule. Please make all your best 
efforts to see that slot code is submitted on time.

SUBJECT>        New Public Network Unix Migration Plan 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Unix migration as we know it is stopped. Tymnet will still migrate the 
Public Net code gen systems to Unix, however, the present implementation 
method of recompiling and reloading each node and slot is no longer practical. 
Network Management reports show that the Unix migration is a partial 
contributor to the recent, unusually poor Quality of Service (QOS) report, 
therefore, we are compelled to devise a different implementation plan than the 
one we presently have. This memo presents that new plan. 
 
At 12pm CST on Wednesday 10 January access to systems 25 and 54 will close 
permanently. All un-migrated nodes (T, C and D files) in TYMNET, TYM5 and 
NETLOAD directories will be copied to tapes in TAR format by Dallas 
Operations. In addition, Dallas Operations will cut tapes of these directories 
and files (T, C, N, B, and D for all network files) and all other 54 and 25 
user files in TITO format which will be shipped to Fremont. Some tapes will be 
installed to system 33, some will be installed to other PDP10's and some will 
be archeived. The shipment to Fremont will occur by 5pm CST on the 10th and 
will be restored to system 33, other PDP10's and the Unix systems into a 
staging directory by 5pm PST on 11 January. Soon thereafter, the Unix mass gen 
program will regen every T and C file that was copied into Unix. 
 
Before the mass gen happens several things will occur. A script will be 
developed to compare the dates of the T and C files in the staging directory 
with the production directory and select the newest files and move them to 
production (e.g. /tym/2/02237). Mass gen will gen all this code and store it 
in the production directories. If the compare script sees the N file was 
created after the T and C files it will not move this to production. 
 
The mass gen script will leave .log files for each slot genned in the 
production directory for that node.  I'll have a script developed which 
searches all the .log files for the string "ERROR" and outputs the node and 
slot numbers into a file which every one can access. The file names are 
/tym/n/errorlog and /tym/n/genlog. Where /n/ is the node range (e.g 
/tym/2/02237, /tym/7/07101, etc.),/tym/n/genlog is the file which will contain 
the master list of all nodes and slots with gen errors and /tym/n/errorlog is 
a log file of all gen errors sorted by node and slot. If you identify a node 
or slot of yours in these files, go to the production directory to debug.

Everyone should review these files, identify whether or not slots they are 
responsible for are there and investigate what caused the gen error for that 
code. PI will handle the Isis and Node Code slots. It is each persons 
responsibility to review this file and determine if any code they may be 
responsible for has had a gen error. If a gen error is found, troubleshoot as 
is standard practice. 
 
Ed Roop (IPC) is planning the moves of the other system 25 and 54 users. He'll 
have a plan for review at 11am Friday 22 December where some decisions will be 
made and the plan will be distributed early next week. It is Ed's considered 
opinion that there is adequate storage space on system 33 for those nodes 
still in the TYMNET and TYM5 directories which are excluded from present Unix 
migration. The exclusion list of public net nodes which will not yet be 
migrated to Unix is attached. Movement of the exceptions (subnets, PSC, ACS 
and international and other miscellaneous nodes) to other PDP's will be 
addressed in Ed Roop's plan. When these nodes are restored to 33 they'll be 
restored into a temporary directory named (TYMOUT). The directory name TYMOUT 
is appropriate because beginning in mid-January migration of these nodes to 
Unix will begin. All nodes planned for the TYMOUT directory are listed in the 
in Appendix B. 
 
Personal and regional directories (e.g. CTS, ETS, etc.) will not be moved. 
Furthermore, it is assumed that the BETATEST, SOURCE and PATCH directories 
will not be copied into the UNIX systems since these should be mirror images 
of the PDP's. Lab nodes files which are not in the TYMNET and TYM5 directories 
are the responsibility of their owners to move to Unix, recompile and reload.
 
PI will do projects on the PDP's for those nodes not yet migrated (see CKNODE 
under Unix) until the close of business on 2 January 1990. As always, there 
are exceptions to most every rule and the exception to this rule is that in 
between now and then PI will do projects on Unix for Consats, Switchers and 
other nodes which do not have multiple customer slots. As is normal PI 
practice, code location for a particular project is written on the project 
report. Projects under Unix before 10 January is the exception not the rule 
and those that will be done under Unix will not affect mutiple slots. All 
other projects until close of business on 2 January will be done on the PDP-
10. 
 
        APPENDIX A:
 
Activities from now to 9 January:
 
        - PI does projects on PDP (except for nodes already under Unix and 
          other exceptions as noted above)
        - UNIX mass gen script is altered from present form to make 
          enhancements 
        - script is written to create .log file master list 
        - IPC (E.Roop) implements plan to move users to other PDP10's 
 
Activites from 10 January and onwards:
 
        - Dallas ops cuts and ships tapes as instructed
        - Fremont ops restores and archeives tapes as instructed
        - beginning at 5pm PST, CS's and PI review .log files
        - begin migration of Appendix B nodes to Unix
        - all projects done on Unix for all nodes except Appendix B
        - all file management for all nodes from Unix enviroment (except 
          Appendix B)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I will reply to the blunt comments in your message dated 22 December on a 
point by point basis then, to conclude, add some blunt comments of my own. 
 
1. The term backup request refers to PDP terminology. If you say you put in a 
"backup" request after genning the code, everyone assumes you genned the code 
on the PDP and submitted a backup request. If this is the case, no wonder the 
message said the slot code is missing. A rule of the migration is the CS would 
gen code on the Unix system and submit an "update" request. An "update" 
request is the Unix replacement to "backup" and is the agreed upon method to 
notify PI that the slot is ready for loading (and for backing up code to the 
production directory in the post migration era). 
 
A prinicpal agreement for the Unix migration is that Public Network nodes 
shall operate completely from Unix or from the PDP. In other words, we do not 
support loading some slots from Unix and others on the same node from the PDP. 
This is the reason 2430 was not loaded. 
 
Regarding the other node in your point 1, N 3576, in searching the directory 
where update requests are stored, you appearently never submitted an update 
request. 
 
2. Version management of interface code is always the responsibility of the 
CS, besides, what are you talking about? The T05 and C05 for this node is the 
same as both systems, I checked. Before making this claim did you checksum the 
files? I am sure you know that binary files are not transportable between the 
PDP and Unix. The T and C files are copied over. 
 
3. I am exasperated about this. Unix sysgen errors on BBXS V6.01 were well 
documented and reported in each and every Unix Migration Program review 
meeting minutes since you were placed on the distribution list on 22 
September. It is obvious to me since you do not read the minutes you do not 
need them and I'll remove you from the distribution list. 
 
4. Patch rstspc.tst is NOT in the /ntdlib/rjepat directory. Missing patches 
and missing versions of source code are not valid SUNESCAL escalations. As in 
the case of the PDP, STS and NTD are responsible to see that patches and 
source are put onto the Unix systems. If you encounter this sort of problem go 
to the responsible group. 
 
Rock, most of the things you complain about are your own fault. You don't read 
the meeting minutes, you don't investigate problems you encounter very well, 
some times not at all,  before firing of a SUNESCAL message which is negative 
in tone, and when you do send us a SUNESCAL you either don't contain enough 
data for us to do something about or you are directing the escalation to the 
wrong group (see point 4 above). I, too, am frustrated, Rock. You waste my 
time and the time of my staff. 
 
I suggest you take a Unix course and fly into San Jose for a day. We'll sit 
down with you and go over anything about Tymnet's Unix enviroment that you 
wish.

        I.  NEXT MEETING - 2:00 P.M. Thursday 28 December C5-600.

       II.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            2.1  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD has released to QA a BITS version
                                 with equivalence file support and fixes
                                 to all reported BITS bugs.  After
                                 satisfactory QA, it will be released to
                                 the Public Net.

            2.2  Failed Loads 

                 A.  BITS 2.11 was installed to fix 2 problems but 
                     introduced many more.  BITS 2.10 dated 25 
                     September was re-installed.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD has re-released to QA a BITS version
                                 with equivalence file support and fixes
                                 to all reported BITS bugs.  After
                                 satisfactory QA, it will be released to
                                 the Public Net.



            2.3  NAD BUGS

                 1) Appending symbol tables, debugging RFI's
                 2) Solo Consats
                 3) PMTS
                 4) NAD bug observed during unattended batch job
                    when a circuit was built but never completed

                   Update: 11/17 A new release of NAD is now in QA that 
                                 fixes above problems 1, 2 and 3.  This
                                 code will be released to Public Net once
                                 NAD passes QA test configuration.

                                 Debugging RFI's, please send hardcopy to
                                 SUNESCAL.

                   Update: 12/21 This release of NAD is installed and 
                                 operational.  Items 1, 2 and 3 closed.

            2.4  INTERACTIVE NAD (Formerly Netcon Boot Script)

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.

                   Update: 11/30 The reason this script fails to operate 
                                 is UNIX NAD does not support switching 
                                 between command and interactive nodes.
                                 This is an explanation why some debugging
                                 scripts used on the PDP don't work, or 
                                 need modification, under UNIX.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD, recognizing the importance of
                                 switching NAD between command and
                                 interactive modes will implement this
feature in a
                                 new NAD release.  Thanks.

      III.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            3.1  PSC

                 Migration of PSC public net nodes and slots will begin in
                 mid to late January.

                   Update: 12/07 G. Masters, ACS, assigned to migrate 
                                 non-OnTyme ACS slot codes.

                   Update: 12/21 Migration of all ACS codes will begin 
                                 1 February.



            3.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                 contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                 United States and are under control of the Public
                 Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 11/09 Pacific Region not ready to begin 
                                 migration yet.  Jeff Oliveto will assist
                                 them to prepare for migration.

       IV.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/05 H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source, and access controls.

                   Update: 11/02 W. Bartlett preparing recommendation 
                                 paper that is intended to get resources
                                 assigned to implement actions to resolve
                                 these issues.

        V.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 11/30 A sub project is underway to modify 
                                 Tymnet information process so that all
                                 software shipments from the UNIX systems
                                 is initiated via the OES.



       VI.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            solo consats and solo switcher code, convert to ISIS, and
            deploy throughout the public net.  A program is required to
            carry out mass TYM and CMD file changes on the UNIX Systems.
            J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are assigned this task and the
            program shall be ready when the UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 12/07 C. Baltrunas and J. Smigh, along with
                                 R. Vivier, S. Wedel and P. Michel have
                                 developed a mass file change script which
                                 allows programs to perform solo consat 
                                 and switcher changes to TYM and CMD
                                 files.  This development significantly
                                 speeds up removal of solo code from
                                 Tymnet.  Furthermore, it can be used
                                 whenever mass changes to Network files is
                                 required.  Item dropped.

      VII.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 11/02 Scheduled delivery date 6 February '90.

                   Update: 12/07 New delivery date is now 2 March 1990.  
                                 Further schedule slips are not allowed
                                 without UNIX migration team approval.

SUBJECT>        New Public Network Unix Migration Plan, Revision 1 
                adding IPC Plan
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Unix migration as we know it is stopped. Tymnet will still migrate the 
Public Net code gen systems to Unix, however, the present implementation 
method of recompiling and reloading each node and slot is no longer practical. 
Network Management reports show that the Unix migration is a partial 
contributor to the recent, unusually poor Quality of Service (QOS) report, 
therefore, we are compelled to devise a different implementation plan than the 
one we presently have. This memo presents that new plan. 
 
At 12pm CST on Wednesday 10 January access to systems 25 and 54 will close 
permanently. All un-migrated nodes (T, C and D files) in TYMNET, TYM5 and 
NETLOAD directories will be copied to tapes in TAR format by Dallas 
Operations. In addition, Dallas Operations will cut tapes of these directories 
and files (T, C, N, B, and D for all network files) and all other 54 and 25 
user files in TITO format which will be shipped to Fremont. Some tapes will be 
installed to system 33, some will be installed to other PDP10's and some will 
be archeived. The shipment to Fremont will occur by 5pm CST on the 10th and 
will be restored to system 33, other PDP10's and the Unix systems into a 
staging directory by 5pm PST on 11 January. Soon thereafter, the Unix mass gen 
program will regen every T and C file that was copied into Unix. 
 
Before the mass gen happens several things will occur. A script will be 
developed to compare the dates of the T and C files in the staging directory 
with the production directory and select the newest files and move them to 
production (e.g. /tym/2/02237). Mass gen will gen all this code and store it 
in the production directories. If the compare script sees the N file was 
created after the T and C files it will not move this to production. 
 
The mass gen script will leave .log files for each slot genned in the 
production directory for that node.  I'll have a script developed which 
searches all the .log files for the string "ERROR" and outputs the node and 
slot numbers into a file which every one can access. The file names are 
/tym/n/errorlog and /tym/n/genlog. Where /n/ is the node range (e.g 
/tym/2/02237, /tym/7/07101, etc.),/tym/n/genlog is the file which will contain 
the master list of all nodes and slots with gen errors and /tym/n/errorlog is 
a log file of all gen errors sorted by node and slot. If you identify a node 
or slot of yours in these files, go to the production directory to debug.
 
Everyone should review these files, identify whether or not slots they are 
responsible for are there and investigate what caused the gen error for that 
code. PI will handle the Isis and Node Code slots. It is each persons 
responsibility to review this file and determine if any code they may be 
responsible for has had a gen error. If a gen error is found, troubleshoot as 
is standard practice. 
 
Ed Roop (IPC) is planning the moves of the other system 25 and 54 users. The 
IPC plan is attached. It is Ed's considered opinion that there is adequate 
storage space on system 33 for those nodes still in the TYMNET and TYM5 
directories which are excluded from present Unix migration. The exclusion list 
of public net nodes which will not yet be migrated to Unix is attached. 
Movement of the exceptions (subnets, PSC, ACS and international and other 
miscellaneous nodes) to other PDP's is addressed in Appendix C. When these 
nodes are restored to 33 they'll be restored into a temporary directory named 
(TYMOUT). The directory name TYMOUT is appropriate because beginning in mid-
January migration of these nodes to Unix will begin. Public Net nodes planned 
for the TYMOUT directory are listed in the in Appendix B. Subnets, PSC and ACS 
nodes are addressed in Appendix C.
 
Personal and regional directories (e.g. CTS, ETS, etc.) will not be moved. 
Furthermore, it is assumed that the BETATEST, SOURCE and PATCH directories 
will not be copied into the UNIX systems since these should be mirror images 
of the PDP's. Lab nodes files which are not in the TYMNET and TYM5 directories 
are the responsibility of their owners to move to Unix, recompile and reload.
 
PI will do projects on the PDP's for those nodes not yet migrated (see CKNODE 
under Unix) until the close of business on 2 January 1990. As always, there 
are exceptions to most every rule and the exception to this rule is that in 
between now and then PI will do projects on Unix for Consats, Switchers and 
other nodes which do not have multiple customer slots. As is normal PI 
practice, code location for a particular project is written on the project 
report. Projects under Unix before 10 January is the exception not the rule 
and those that will be done under Unix will not affect mutiple slots. All 
other projects until close of business on 2 January will be done on the PDP-
10. 
 
        APPENDIX A:
 
Activities from now to 9 January:
 
        - PI does projects on PDP (except for nodes already under Unix and 
          other exceptions as noted above)
        - UNIX mass gen script is altered from present form to make 
          enhancements 
        - script is written to create .log file master list 
        - IPC (E.Roop) implements plan to move users to other PDP10's 
 
Activites from 10 January and onwards:
 
        - Dallas ops cuts and ships tapes as instructed
        - Fremont ops restores and archeives tapes as instructed
        - beginning at 5pm PST, CS's and PI review .log files
        - begin migration of Appendix B nodes to Unix
        - all projects done on Unix for all nodes except Appendix B
        - all file management for all nodes from Unix enviroment (except 
          Appendix B)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     In order to facilitate the migration to the SUNS, It has been decided 
to permanently shut down systems 25 and 54 on Wednesday, January 10 at 12:00.   
     
     Both of these PDP10 systems are dedicated to the public network. 
     
     If you are presently using hosts 25 or 54; please begin using the
SUNS systems as your primary host. PDP10 system 33 will be used for a 
back up host only.  
     
     Due to specific business plans, special arrangements will be made
for ACS, PAYMENTS and SUBNET accounts. All others are assumed to 
migrate to the SUNS.

ATTENDEES:  C. Baltrunas, L. Chavez, M. Erickson, C. Fletcher, 
            G. Masters, H. Matthews, L. Orona, P. Whitehurst, 

12/01 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  1) 687 nodes migrated to UNIX, less than 
                            2000 to go by year end to meet the near 
                            term goal of shutting down one PDP by year
                            end.  It shall be done!
                         2) After a node is converted to UNIX, the code
                            from the PDP 10 Tym and Tym 5 directories 
                            will be removed to a hidden location.  This
                            is done for all nodes that are migrated, 
                            and will continue to be done as the migration
                            proceeds.
                         3) A UNIX "learn" program is being put on the
                            Public Net code gen system - watch for an
                            availability announcement.
                         4) A new release of BITS (2.11) was loaded and
                            removed.  It created more problems than it  
                            fixed.
                         5) NTD was asked to release NAD but did not.  It
                            will be installed the week of 11 December.
                         6) A significant tool was developed that will 
                            improve Tymnet's QOS.  Congratulations is in
                            order to C. Baltrunas, J. Smith, R. Vivier,
                            S. Wedel and P. Michel.

      I.    NEXT MEETING - 2:00 P.M. Thursday 14 December C5-600.

       II.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            2.1  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 10/05 Development underway, fix will be
                                 retro-fitted to present Bits version.

                   Update: 11/30 NTD targets a release of BITS with this
                                 capability to QA by 12/15.





            2.2  Failed Loads

                 A.  BITS 2.11 was installed to fix 2 problems but 
                     introduced many more.  BITS 2.10 dated 25 
                     September was re-installed.

            2.3  NAD BUGS

                 1) Appending symbol tables, debuggingr RFI's
                 2) Solo Consats
                 3) PMTS
                 4) NAD bug observed during unattended batch job
                    when a circuit was built but never completed

                   Update: 11/17 A new release of NAD is now in QA that 
                                 fixes above problems 1, 2 and 3.  This
                                 code will be released to Public Net once
                                 NAD passes QA test configuration.

                                 Debugging RFI's, please send hardcopy to
                                 SUNESCAL.

                   Action: 11/30 H. Matthews to learn when this release 
                                 will occur.

                   Update: 12/01 H. Matthews requested release of NAD 
                                 2.15.

                   Action: 12/07 H. Matthews to request again.

            2.4  NETCON BOOT SCRIPT

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.

                   Update: 11/30 The reason this script fails to operate 
                                 is UNIX NAD does not support switching 
                                 between command and interactive nodes.
                                 This is an explanation why some debugging
                                 scripts used on the PDP don't work, or 
                                 need modification, under UNIX.

      III.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            3.1  PMTS

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  





            3.2  ACS 

                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

                   Update: 10/26 BBXS code released to beta test 
                                 directory.

                   Update: 12/07 G. Masters, ACS, assigned to migrate 
                                 non-OnTyme ACS slot codes.

            3.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                 contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                 United States and are under control of the Public
                 Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/26 Pacific region obtaining UNIX 
                                 validations, Europe migration delayed 
                                 until 1Q90.

                   Update: 11/09 Pacific Region not ready to begin 
                                 migration yet.  Jeff Oliveto will assist
                                 them to prepare for migration.

            3.4  FSC 

                   Action: 10/26 Diagnostics moved to SUN's and 
                                 R. Ferguson to test load this week.

                                 Complete employee validations.

            3.5  LEMCOMS

                   Update: 12/07 Lemcom testing is proved satisfactory.  
                                 These nodes will be migrated as normal.
                                 Item dropped.

            3.6  PDP 10 BASE

                 Loads must be scheduled with Fremont and Dallas          
                 operators. 
 
                   Action: 11/30 M. Erickson.  Prior to scheduling loads,
                                 some technical problems must be resolved.

                   Action:  11/30 J. Smith assigned to resolve this.

       IV.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/05 H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source, and access controls.

                   Update: 11/02 W. Bartlett preparing recommendation 
                                 paper that is intended to get resources
                                 assigned to implement actions to resolve
                                 these issues.

        V.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 11/30 A sub project is underway to modify 
                                 Tymnet information process so that all
                                 software shipments from the UNIX systems
                                 is initiated via the OES.

       VI.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            solo consats and solo switcher code, convert to ISIS, and
            deploy throughout the public net.  A program is required to
            carry out mass TYM and CMD file changes on the UNIX Systems.
            J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are assigned this task and the
            program shall be ready when the UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 12/07 C. Baltrunas and J. Smigh, along with
                                 R. Vivier, S. Wedel and P. Michel have
                                 developed a mass file change script which
                                 allows programs to perform solo consat 
                                 and switcher changes to TYM and CMD
                                 files.  This development significantly

                                 Tymnet.  Furthermore, it can be used
                                 whenever mass changes to Network files is
                                 required.

                   Update: 12/07 NTD removed the BITS developer assigned
                                 to repair present BITS bugs.  This caused
                                 the project to slip 26 days.  New 
                                 delivery date is now 2 March 1990.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



     
     In order to facilitate the migration to the SUNS, It has been decided 
to permanently shut down systems 25 and 54 on Wednesday, January 10 at 12:00.   
     
     Both of these PDP10 systems are dedicated to the public network. 
     
     If you are presently using hosts 25 or 54; please begin using the
SUNS systems as your primary host. PDP10 system 33 will be used for a 
back up host only.  
     
     Due to specific business plans, special arrangements will be made
for ACS, PAYMENTS and SUBNET accounts. All others are assumed to 
migrate to the SUNS.

       II.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            2.1  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD has released to QA a BITS version
                                 with equivalence file support and fixes
                                 to all reported BITS bugs.  After
                                 satisfactory QA, it will be released to
                                 the Public Net.

            2.2  Failed Loads 

                 A.  BITS 2.11 was installed to fix 2 problems.  Whether
                     or not 2.11 actually fixed both of them is unclear
                     since several other user problems came up. Therefore,
                     BITS 2.10 dated 25 September was re-installed.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD has re-released to QA a BITS version
                                 with equivalence file support and fixes
                                 to all reported BITS bugs.  After
                                 satisfactory QA, it will be released to
                                 the Public Net.

                 B.  Netcon has reported some load failures.  P. Michel,
                     on advice from STS, recommended a troubleshooting 
                     plan to Netcon to gather more information on load
                     failures.

                   Action: 12/21 Netcon to implement plan when failures
                                 occur.



            2.3  NAD BUG

                 1) NAD bug observed during unattended batch job
                    when a circuit was built but never completed

                   Update: 12/28 NTD to advise date when fix will be 
                                 delivered at the next meeting.

            2.4  INTERACTIVE NAD (Formerly Netcon Boot Script)

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.

                   Update: 11/30 The reason this script fails to operate 
                                 is UNIX NAD does not support switching 
                                 between command and interactive nodes.
                                 This is an explanation why some debugging
                                 scripts used on the PDP don't work, or 
                                 need modification, under UNIX.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD, recognizing the importance of
                                 switching NAD between command and 
                                 interactive modes will implement this 
                                 feature in a new NAD release.  Thanks.

      III.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            3.1  PSC

                 Migration of PSC public net nodes and slots will begin in
                 mid to late January.

            3.2  ACS 

                   Update: 12/07 G. Masters, ACS, assigned to migrate 
                                 non-OnTyme ACS slot codes.

                   Update: 12/21 Migration of all ACS codes will begin 
                                 1 February.

            3.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                 contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                 United States and are under control of the Public
                 Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 11/09 Pacific Region not ready to begin 
                                 migration yet.  Jeff Oliveto will assist
                                 them to prepare for migration.

            3.4  FSC 

                   Action: 10/26 Diagnostics moved to SUN's and 
                                 R. Ferguson to test load this week.

                                 Complete employee validations.



            3.5  PDP 10 BASE

                 Loads must be scheduled with Fremont and Dallas          
                 operators. 
 
                   Action: 11/30 M. Erickson.  Prior to scheduling loads,
                                 some technical problems must be resolved.

                   Action:  11/30 J. Smith assigned to resolve this.

       IV.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/05 H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source, and access controls.

                   Update: 11/02 W. Bartlett preparing recommendation 
                                 paper that is intended to get resources
                                 assigned to implement actions to resolve
                                 these issues.

        V.  SOFTWARE ORDERING AND FULFILLMENT PROCEDURES

                   Update: 11/30 A sub project is underway to modify 
                                 Tymnet information process so that all
                                 software shipments from the UNIX systems
                                 is initiated via the OES.


       VI.  PUBLIC NET MASS FILE CHANGE REQUESTS

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            solo consats and solo switcher code, convert to ISIS, and
            deploy throughout the public net.  A program is required to
            carry out mass TYM and CMD file changes on the UNIX Systems.
            J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are assigned this task and the
            program shall be ready when the UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 12/07 C. Baltrunas and J. Smith, along with
                                 R. Vivier, S. Wedel and P. Michel have
                                 developed a mass file change script which
                                 allows programs to perform solo consat 
                                 and switcher changes to TYM and CMD
                                 files.  This development significantly
                                 speeds up removal of solo code from
                                 Tymnet.  Furthermore, it can be used
                                 whenever mass changes to Network files is
                                 required.  Item dropped.



  VII.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 11/02 Scheduled delivery date 6 February '90.

                   Update: 12/07 New delivery date is now 2 March 1990.  
                                 Further schedule slips are not allowed
                                 without UNIX migration team approval.

                                     method to communicate with UNIX 
                                     system support.
           
      III.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            3.1  NTD to get equivalence file capability working.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD has released to QA a BITS version
                                 with equivalence file support and fixes
                                 to all reported BITS bugs.  After
                                 satisfactory QA, it will be released to
                                 the Public Net.

                   Update:  1/4  Attempts are being made for QA release by
                                 9 January.

            3.2  Failed Loads 

                 A.  BITS 2.11 was installed to fix 2 problems.  Whether
                     or not 2.11 actually fixed both of them is unclear
                     since several other user problems came up. Therefore,
                     BITS 2.10 dated 25 September was re-installed.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD has re-released to QA a BITS version
                                 with equivalence file support and fixes
                                 to all reported BITS bugs.  After
                                 satisfactory QA, it will be released to
                                 the Public Net.

                   Update:  1/4  Attempts are being made for QA release by
                                 9 January.



                 B.  Netcon has reported some load failures.  P. Michel,
                     on advice from STS, recommended a troubleshooting 
                     plan to Netcon to gather more information on load
                     failures.

                   Action: 12/21 Netcon to implement plan when failures
                                 occur.

                   Update:  1/4  Using this plan, one solid hardware
                                 problem has been solved.  Also, trend
                                 data is being gathered to isolate failure
                                 circumstances.

            3.3  NAD BUG

                 1) NAD bug observed during unattended batch job
                    when a circuit was built but never completed

                   Update: 12/28 NTD to advise date when fix will be 
                                 delivered at the next meeting.

            3.4  INTERACTIVE NAD (Formerly Netcon Boot Script)

                   Update: 11/30 The reason this script fails to operate 
                                 is UNIX NAD does not support switching 
                                 between command and interactive nodes.
                                 This is an explanation why some debugging
                                 scripts used on the PDP don't work, or 
                                 need modification, under UNIX.

                   Update: 12/21 NTD, recognizing the importance of
                                 switching NAD between command and 
                                 interactive modes will implement this 
                                 feature in a new NAD release.  Thanks.

       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            4.1  PSC

                 Migration of PSC public net nodes and slots will begin in
                 mid to late January.

            4.2  ACS 

                   Update: 12/07 G. Masters, ACS, assigned to migrate 
                                 non-OnTyme ACS slot codes.

                   Update: 12/21 Migration of all ACS codes will begin 
                                 1 February.

            4.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                 contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                 United States and are under control of the Public
                 Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 11/09 Pacific Region not ready to begin 
                                 migration yet.  Jeff Oliveto will assist
                                 them to prepare for migration.



            4.4  FSC 

                   Action: 10/26 Diagnostics moved to SUN's and 
                                 R. Ferguson to test load this week.

                                 Complete employee validations.

            4.5  PDP 10 BASE

                 Loads must be scheduled with Fremont and Dallas          
                 operators. 
 
                   Action: 11/30 M. Erickson.  Prior to scheduling loads,
                                 some technical problems must be resolved.

                   Action:  11/30 J. Smith assigned to resolve this.

        V.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/05 H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source, and access controls.

                   Update:  1/4  B. Soley is preparing a paper that 
                                 advises all measures for SUN System    
                                 operators to implement in order to secure
                                 BT Tymnet UNIX systems.

       VI.  SOFTWARE ORDERING AND FULFILLMENT PROCEDURES

                   Update: 11/30 A sub project is underway to modify 
                                 Tymnet information process so that all
                                 software shipments from the UNIX systems
                                 is initiated via the OES.

                   Update:  1/4  This project is near completion.  See
                                 J. Weisinger for details.  Full effect on
                                 private and subnets will be evident when
                                 all code gen PDP's are shut down.

      VII.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 11/02 Scheduled delivery date 6 February '90.

                   Update: 12/07 New delivery date is now 2 March 1990.  
                                 Further schedule slips are not allowed
                                 without UNIX migration team approval.

                   Update:  1/4  NTD advises of resource problem on this
                                 project.  NTD will review schedule and
                                 determine available options.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Mass gen has not started yet because the file comparisons between the PDP and 
Unix production directories is taking longer than expected. The compares were 
underway but stopped when Saturn had a problem and did not properly restart 
from a reboot. Since the Sun servers are networked together the problem Saturn 
had made us reboot Gemini as well. All this is complete and the file servers 
are again operational anf the compares have restarted where they left off. 
Afterwards, mass gen will begin probably likely later today and you can 
inspect the /tym/n/genlog and /tym/n/errorlog directories to look for gen 
errors. Please refer to OnTyme msg# M2169 for details of compare, mass gen and 
these directories.
 
During this time of transition we must be careful to work with the production 
code. Use the "CKNODE node number" unix command to determine where the code 
is. Output from this command will either be PDP, SUN or UNTOUCHED. 
 
        a. if SUN then node was migrated and production code is in Unix 
        
        b. if PDP then this node is either:
 
                        a. on exception list (see attached)
 
                        or
 
                        b. the code is in transition to Unix (if the node in 
                           question not on the exception list)
 
        c. if UNTOUCHED then this code is in transition to Unix and is 
           unavailable except by Netcon shut overides on 54 and 25.
 
Once mass gen is done, CKNODE will be updated to change all UNTOUCHED to SUN. 
This should happen this evening or on Saturday.
