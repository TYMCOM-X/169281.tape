NEWMON.SAV has been patched to F26-P035/D-1 to fix the PCBFL1 stopcodes.
That stopcode was caused when any program that peeks at the monitor (such
as ICP, TAKEIT, and CTYLOG) tried to run on a system with 4 meg and 2
real strings of 3652 disks.  The bug is at least 8 years old but hasn't
shown up until now.  		/Joe Smith

On Friday, 18 Mar at 18:20:24, Joe Smith sent an Ontyme to bring
F26 up on NEWMON.SAV.  If proper procedures were followed
the problem with ASP Dump could have been avoided.  See messages
below:

NEWMON.SAV has been patched to F26-P035/D-1 to fix the PCBFL1 stopcodes.
That stopcode was caused when any program that peeks at the monitor (such
as ICP, TAKEIT, and CTYLOG) tried to run on a system with 4 meg and 2
real strings of 3652 disks.  The bug is at least 8 years old but hasn't
shown up until now.             /Joe Smith

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitors have been rolled.  Update (SYS)SYSTEM.sav and (SYS)BACKUP.sav
monitors tapes.  Run and post an updated DSKMAP and post on mainframe.
If F26 should go down, it will come up on monitor F26-p035/D-1.

Thanks Rick

Contact:  "Fountana" Data Center, Mike Silva, System 26, no incident number.
Problem:  PAKCOP hung after copying cylinder 504 on BPA2.
          Select light off, no action in memory lights, no response to the
          attention button.  They wanted to know if it was OK to do an ASP
          save on the 3652.  BPC2 copied out OK.
Fix:      I suggested they try the OLDC command.  It got an unrcoverable
          error on cylinder 473.  Told them to do the ASP one-disk save.
          This worked, but BPC2 had a "missing or inconsistent pack set id",
          which was to be expected.  After putting a JFCL at STRFIX, the
          system came up running a full DSKCLN.

   FSC RAN DIAGS ON DISK DRIVE A1 OK.
   
   ZFORMATTED DR A1 AND COPIED C1 TO A1.
   PACK (260009) BPC2 COPIED OKAY, BUT PACK (260001) BPA2
   WOULD NOT COPY. PACKCOPY WOULD STOP WHEN REACHING CYLINDER 504.
   CALLED SOFTWARE SUPPORT AND JOE SUGGESTED WE TRY OLDC IN PACKCOPY.
   SAME THING HAPPENED AS BEFORE BUT AT CYLINDER 473.
   WE THEN DID A ONE PACK ASP SAVE AND FSC ADDRESSED A1 TO BE C1
   AND C1 TO BE A1. WE THEN RESTORED DSKB1 WITH NO PROBLEM.
   THE NEXT PROBLEM WAS A MISSING OR INCONSISTENT PACK ID ON
   UNIT BPC2. THIS WAS FIXED IN DDT.
   
   SYSTEM WAS RUN THROUGH A FULL DSKCLN AND CAME UP CLEAN.

   LOADED. ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH 3674 POWERING DOWN DURING IMPL.
   TALKED TO FSC AND SOLVED THAT PROBLEM. BOTH UNITS ZFORMATTED

   WITH NO PROBLEM. WHEN UP SOME FILES AND DIRECTORIES WHERE

SYSTEM 26 WAS HUNG BY CHAVEZJ. THE REASON WAS
THAT AROUND 0434 THE CTY PRINTED STOPCODE
BASE; THE BASE CAME BACKUP 5 SECONDS LETTER.
WHEN USERS WERE TRING TO LOAD A NODE USING
LOADII ALL THEY GOT WAS BUILDING CIRCUIT AND
NO MORE. WE TRIED DOING A TELECOPY TO SYSTEM 74
BUT DID NOT GET THE COPY STARTING  FROM THE SYSTEM.
F26 WAS CYCLED BY OPER. AT 0535 7/18/90;
SYSTEM ANSWERED AT 0541. SYSTEM CHECK OK.
