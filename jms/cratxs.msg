X17 SPECIAL BACKUP
System X17 (RM03) down due to garbage in page 0 (KS-boot pointer) and
garbage in RIB to DSKCLN.SAV.  Booted from tape, came up in CONSOLE mode
to run (SYS)DSKCLN.107 in CHECK mode.  "DELETE (SYS)DSKCLN.SAV/BAD" and
"RENAME (SYS)DSKCLN.107,(SYS)DSKCLN.SAV".  After full DSKCLN, was able
to restore most of the files in (SYS)RECOV.SYS, but left (CARL)FSLAVE.SAV
and (CARL)MT.SAV alone.  DSKCLN did not detect all files damaged by MUP
because the new file that overlapped the old file got deleted before DSKCLN
had a chance to run (001RPG.TMP in particular).

Two incremental saves have been done: (NOBACKUP)INC11.DIR on 19-Oct-88 and
(NOBACKUP)INC12.DIR on 21-Oct-88.

Subject: Interesting crash on system 32 

When system 32 crashed on you, it was from an unexpected error in the
monitor having to do with virtual pages in the current working set.
My guess is that the WSCTL uuo failed when it couldn't find suitable
disk pages due to the SATs being messed up.   I ran it after X32 came
back up, and got the expected "cannot be telecopied; logout".
