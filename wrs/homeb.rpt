  The efficacy and cost of implementing an intermediate level of
newborn intensive care (INIC) was retrospectively evaluated over
a four-year period in Calcutta  to  see  if  survival  could  be
improved  at  low  cost  using  indigenous  human  and  material
resources.  The patient population (94.7%  less than or equal to
2500 g) included all infants admitted to the facilities operated
by the International Mission of Hope (India)  Society.  Survival
was compared within 250-g increments in  1980  and  1981,   when
infants with major medical problems were hospitalized in outside
facilities (mortality,  100%)  and 1982 and 1983,  when INIC was
provided  completely  within  the  facility.   Overall  survival
increased from 37.9% (n =  504)  in 1980 and 1981 to 70.5%  (n =
581) in 1982 and 1983. Infants weighing 1251 to 2000 g benefited
greatly (34.4% [n = 279], 74.8% [n = 322])  from INIC.  Survival
of infants weighing 1250 g or less, although improved,  remained
low (5.6% [n = 89] to 23.1% [n =  108]).  The average daily cost
for  the entire period of hospitalization was $7.75.  These data
indicate that survival in infants of low  birth  weight  can  be
improved  with  INIC  at  modest  cost  using  resources already
available within the community. However, the application of this
type  of  program  must  still  be  considered  in  relation  to
strategies designed to reduce the number of infants of low birth
weight as well as to the long-term goals and available financial
resources in non-industrialized countries.

  Two  hundred  and  twenty-six term singleton breech deliveries
were managed prospectively during a 5-year period  according  to
Westin's  feto-pelvic  scoring system based on X-ray pelvimetry,
estimated fetal weight, type of breech,  and outcome of previous
vaginal  deliveries.   The  vaginal delivery rate was 45.1%  and
cesarean section rate 54.9%. 81.5% of cesarean sections could be
planned in advance,  based on  the  scoring  system.   Corrected
neonatal mortality was nil and persistent morbidity was 0.4% for
the whole material. Asphyxia,  defined as 5 min Apgar score less
than 7, occurred in only 1%  of cases,  evenly distributed among
vaginal  and  planned  cesarean  deliveries.  It was possible by
means of the scoring system to identify a  group  of  women  who
could give birth vaginally,  without any mortality or persistent
morbidity.

  In  113  cases  of  fetal  cardiac  arrhythmia,  i.e.  94 with
supraventricular arrhythmia,  5 with atrioventricular block  and
14 with ventricular arrhythmia, the clinical outcome was studied
and   compared   with  the  general  pregnant  population.   The
arrhythmia group was afflicted with  a  significantly  increased
frequency  of congenital malformations,  6.2%  vs.  2.0%;  fetal
distress in labor, 20.4% vs.  13.5%;  perinatal mortality,  3.5%
vs. 0.7%; and neonatal mortality,  1.8%  vs.  0.1%.  In 4 cases,
pharmacological cardiac treatment was needed  in  utero  due  to
fetal  heart  failure.   Fetuses  with  cardiac  arrhythmia thus
constitute an  obstetric  and  pediatric  high-risk  group  that
should  be  subjected  to  an  intensified supervision to detect
fetal heart failure or fetal distress.  When  indicated,   these
complications can be treated in utero.

  Ninety-nine consecutive  diabetic  pregnancies  (101  infants)
were monitored with altogether 2672 nonstress tests (NSTs)  from
about 30 weeks of gestation until parturition.  In 96%   of  the
women  the  last  NST  was  performed within 2 days of delivery.
Fifty-nine percent had normal NSTs throughout  pregnancy.   Only
3.7%   of the 2 672 tests were classified as pathological.  When
performed within 2 days antepartum,  a normal NST predicted  the
1-min  Apgar score to be greater than or equal to 7 in 92%,  and
at 5 and 10 min in 99%.   When  all  NSTs  ever  performed  were
included,   the  predictive  value improved to 100%.  The baby's
first cry within  1  min  after  birth  was  predicted  in  96%.
Furthermore,  the predictive value of a normal NST regarding the
absence of ominous intrapartum cardiotocographic (CTG) patterns,
normal pulmonary function and  normal  metabolic  balance,   was
about 80%.  The perinatal mortality was 1%.  The specificity was
in general good  (86-96%),   whereas  the  predictive  value  of
pathological  tests and the sensitivity almost without exception
were  poor.   It  is  concluded  that  the  very  low  rate   of
pathological  NSTs  indicates  that obstetric interventions were
made soon after the  occurrence  of  the  first  sign  of  fetal
jeopardy. Only then, and with meticulous care, is it possible to
obtain good results. A normal NST is an excellent predictor of a
normal  Apgar  score  at 5 and 10 min,  and also very good for a
normal 1-min  Apgar  and  an  early  cry  from  the  baby.   The
predictive  value is quite acceptable concerning the intrapartum
CTG and the neonatal course  likewise  regarding  the  pulmonary
function and metabolic balance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

  Diabetes  mellitus  and  pregnancy.   A seven-year material of

  A  7-year  survey  of  the outcome of pregnancy complicated by
diabetes mellitus,   carried  out  at  the  Aarhus  center,   is
presented.   The  material comprised 344 diabetic pregnant women
where the control was based mainly  on  a  centralized  ambulant
regime.    The   latter   half-period   was  moreover  based  on
self-monitoring of the blood glucose  level.   This  achieved  a
significantly better blood glucose regulation,  with a reduction
of the  mean  blood  glucose  level  from  7.9  to  6.4  mmol/l.
Furthermore,   the  introduction  of  self-monitoring halved the
number  of  hospitalizations   necessary   for   blood   glucose
regulation.   Pregnancy  was  complicated  in  about  35%.   The
importance  of  screening  for  urinary   tract   infection   is
emphasized, since this, which was present in 20% of cases, might
be a possible factor in ketoacidosis and/or intra-uterine growth
retardation.   In  19%   of  the  vaginal  births  it was deemed
necessary to give instrumental  assistance;   5%   had  shoulder
dystocia. The cesarean section frequency was 31%.  The antenatal
mortality rate was 1.2%  and the uncorrected perinatal mortality
was  3.5%,   half  of  the  neonatal  mortality was due to fatal
congenital malformations.  About  half  of  the  newborn  babies
required immediate intensive neonatal treatment.  Because of the
high frequency of complications in pregnant  diabetics,   during
childbirth and in the neonatal period, centralized monitoring by
a  highly specialized team is necessary in order to maintain the
present relatively low perinatal mortality and  morbidity  rates
and the low number of cesarean sections,  together with the most
convenient control regimen for this highly  pathological  group.
Furthermore,   centralization  will  facilitate  research which,
together  with  prepregnancy  consultation,   may   reduce   the
frequency of major fetal malformations.

  Although methanol (MEOH)  may assume a significant role  as  a
fuel,   which implies wide availability,  little is known of its
toxicity apart from acute poisoning episodes  in  human  adults.
Even  less  is known about its toxicity in developing organisms.
This experiment studied the early behavioral development of rats
whose mothers had consumed MEOH during  gestation  by  measuring
the  responses  of  suckling (postnatal day 1)  and nest-seeking
(postnatal day 10).  Primigravida Long-Evans rats  were  divided
into three groups (N = 10).  Two of the groups consumed drinking
solutions of 2%  MEOH  instead  of  distilled  water  either  on
gestational days 15-17 (MEOH 1)  or 17-19 (MEOH 2).  No maternal
toxicity was apparent as measured by weight  gain,   gestational
duration,   and  daily  fluid  intake.   Daily  MEOH consumption
averaged 2.5 gm/kg over the 3-day period in  both  MEOH  groups.
Litter size,  birth weight,  and infant mortality did not differ
among the three groups. Postnatal growth and date of eye opening
were unaffected.  MEOH pups required  longer  than  controls  to
begin  suckling  on postnatal day 1.  On postnatal day 10,  they
required more time to locate nesting material  from  their  home
cages.   These  data suggest that prenatal MEOH exposure induces
behavioral abnormalities early in life that are unaccompanied by
overt toxicity.

  An inquiry was circulated among all Departments of Gynaecology
and Obstetrics in West Germany and West-Berlin  with  regard  to
their  procedure  to effect foetal intensive-care management and
monitoring,  obstetrical management,  and the results  obtained.
58% of these Departments responded. With an average number of 55
beds,   the  annual birth rate is 628.  A mean of 191 births are
covered by one CTG unit,  the scatter being 110-290  births  per
year and per unit (10th and 90th percentile). The mean incidence
of  Caesarean  section  is  11%,   the mean incidence of forceps
delivery 3.6%,  and the mean incidence of extraction by  suction
8.0%.   An  estimated  95%   of  all  births  are  monitored via
cardiotocography.  25%  of all Departments use other  monitoring
methods  as well,  microanalysis of blood gas after Saling being
by far the most prominent one (94%).  Transcutaneous foetal  pO2
measurement  has  been  adopted  by 8 centres only.  74%  of the
Departments are using CTG units recording  beat-to-beat  with  a
chart  speed of 1 cm per minute (82.2%).  Few (18%)  Departments
employ intrauterine pressure measurement  for  recording  labour
pains.  Telemetry is used by 27.7%  of the Departments.  In most
cases (72.9%)  the cardiotocograms are jointly assessed  by  the
physician and the midwife. From the obstetrician's point of view
it would be desirable to achieve greater technical perfection of
external monitoring methods,  as well as further miniaturisation
and computerisation of the CTG equipment.

  As an adjunct to the general nutrition research programme, the
MRC Dunn Nutrition Unit has provided for the  past  10  years  a
continuous  medical  service  to  three  adjacent  rural Gambian
villages.  There have  been  substantial  reductions  in  annual
childhood  mortality rates.  Perinatal mortality fell from 109.6
to 45.5 per 1000 births, infant mortality from 148.5 to 24.5 per
1000 live births,  and mortality in children aged 1-4 years from
109.1  to  13.3  per 1000.  There have been no pregnancy-related
maternal deaths in the community for 8 years; 16 could have been
expected given current estimates of maternal mortality elsewhere
in rural Gambia. Of all the health and nutritional interventions
introduced the single most important factor has apparently  been
the  on-the-spot,  24 h availability of a physician or qualified
midwife.

  Out-of-hospital  births  in  Alabama  are  characterized  with
special  emphasis on the period from 1970 to 1980.  Women having
an out-of-hospital birth were more likely to be nonwhite,   aged
greater than or equal to 35,  and multiparous and to have little
or no prenatal care.  However,  within the group of women having
out-of-hospital   delivery,    characteristics  which  predicted
neonatal  death  included  being  white,   aged  less  than  20,
primiparous,   and  unmarried  and  having little or no prenatal
care.  Both the risk factors for and outcomes of out-of-hospital
birth differed markedly by race. In all, out-of-hospital births,
which declined from 25% to 0.5% of all births from 1940 to 1980,
were  associated  with a twofold increase in neonatal mortality.
The major care provider for out-of-hospital births, the "granny"
midwife, was found to have little knowledge about, or ability to
provide,   modern  obstetric  care.   High-risk  status  of  the
patients,   limited  capability of the care-givers,  and lack of
appropriate  medical  resources  are  suggested  as  the  likely
reasons  for  the  excess  neonatal mortality in out-of-hospital
births.

  The authors analyse the results of 4 years home supervision of
high-risk pregnancies by hospital midwives. The inquiry concerns
813 women out of a total of 12,643 deliveries in the same period
of time (1978-1981).  This supervision deals with the people who
were  selected by patient consultation or after hospitalisation.
It is  particularly  concerned  with  patients  with  threatened
premature labour.  The role of the midwife is at once medical in
that she undertakes a  constant  review  of  the  state  of  the
pregnancy,   and social and psychological.  Domiciliary visiting
can often take the place of admission to hospital.  Even  though
has not been a great decrease in the number of premature labours
it  does  seen  certain  that patients who have been followed in
this way have had pregnancies that have lasted r.  Over the
4  years  when  the  experience  has  been  gained the number of
deliveries occurring before the 34th week has dropped  from  2.8
to  1%.   Finally,  it is an extremely efficient way of lowering
hospital expenses.

  Neonatal mortality examined  by  place  and  circumstances  of
delivery  in  North  Carolina  during  1974  through  1976  with
attention given to home delivery.  Planned  home  deliveries  by
lay-midwives  resulted  in  three neonatal deaths per 1,000 live
births;  planned home  deliveries  without  a  lay-midwife,   30
neonatal  deaths  per  1,000  live  births;   and unplanned home
deliveries, 120 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births. The women
babies were delivered by lay-midwives were  screened  in  county
health  departments  and  found  to  be medically at low risk of
complication,   despite   having   demographic   characteristics
associated with high-risk of neonatal mortality. Conversely, the
women  delivered  at  home without known prenatal screening or a
trained attendant had low-risk demographic  characteristics  but
experienced  a  high  rate  of  neonatal  mortality.   Planning,
prenatal screening,  and attendant-training  were  important  in
differentiating   the   risk   of  neonatal  mortality  in  this

  The position of Singapore as regards birthweight  distribution
and  perinatal mortality has been compared with six countries in
the 1973 WHO study namely, Austria, Cuba,  Hungary,  Japan,  New
Zealand  and  Sweden.   Birthweight  distribution  and perinatal
mortality reflect both the social and  health  conditions  of  a
population  and  the standards of obstetric and paediatric care,
and seeing where a country ranks in the international comparison
of them may play a role in the formulation of health policy  for
that  country.   Singapore was well placed for the proportion of
very low birthweight babies (less than 1,500 grams), ranking 2nd
for both live births (0.5%)  and total births  (0.7%).   It  was
however  not  so  well  placed for proportion of low birthweight
babies (less than 2,500 grams), ranking 5th for both live births
(8.8%)  and total  births  (9.2%).   With  regard  to  perinatal
mortality  Singapore  at  20.0 per 1,000 total births ranked 4th
and this improved to 3rd after standardizing for birthweight and
in fact was little different  from  Hungary  (1st)   and  Sweden
(2nd).   Given  that  standardization  for  birthweight  largely
removes the effect of "socioeconomic and demographic factors" so
that remaining differences to a  large  extent  reflect  medical
care,   this  indicates  a relatively high standard of perinatal
care  in  Singapore.   The  problems  of  interpretation,    the
implications of the findings and suggestions for improving birth
statistics in Singapore are discussed.

  A  prospective  survey was undertaken in 26 practices in Essex
to assess the risks associated with a home birth.  The 202 women
who  were  booked  for  a  home confinement were compared with a
similar group of 185 women who were booked for hospital delivery
under consultant care.  The principal difference in outcome  was
the induction rate of 19% in the hospital group compared with 8%
in  the  group  booked  for  delivery at home.  A higher rate of
episiotomy and second degree tears and more Apgar scores of 7 or
below were found in those who were booked for  hospital.   There
were  no  perinatal deaths in either group.  The results of this
study showed no evidence of an increased  risk  associated  with
home  confinements  but indicated that there were fewer problems

  An  examination  of  1978  natality data for the United States
disclosed that low birth weight was  less  common  among  30,819
infants  born  out of hospital than among 3,294,101 infants born
in hospital in that year.  When controls were applied for  birth
attendant, infants' race, and mothers' education, age, nativity,
and  parity,  the data revealed that white,  well-educated women
between 25 and 39 years of age,  who were  having  their  second
babies  and  were attended by midwives out of hospital,  were at
least risk of bearing low birth weight infants.   The  incidence
rate  of  low birth weight babies was lower for midwife-attended
births in every category examined.  For  college-educated  white
women,   for  example,  the incidence rate was 2.0 percent among
those attended by midwives, 4.6 percent among those giving birth
in hospital,  and 3.6 percent among those whose  out-of-hospital
deliveries were attended by physicians.  Apgar scores for babies
born both in and out of hospital were also studied but,  because
of inconsistent reporting, were given less attention.  Excellent
(9-10)  Apgar scores were more common among babies born  out  of
hospital  than among those born in hospital (63 percent compared
with  49  percent),   particularly  for  out-of-hospital  births
attended  by  physicians.  At least with respect to birth weight
and Apgar scores,  the claim  that  out-of-hospital  births  are
inherently  more  dangerous  than  hospital  births  receives no
support from these data.  The findings also suggest the need for
further  refinement of vital statistics categories to permit the
analysis of distinctions between births  attended  by  certified
nurse-midwives  and  those attended by lay midwives,  as well as
differences between births at  home  and  those  in  alternative
birth centers.

  Our study of 390 patients enrolled in a birthing suite program
revealed  that  antepartum  or intrapartum problems allowed only
160 (41%)   to  actually  give  birth  in  the  birthing  suite.
Antepartum complications included premature labor in ten (2.5%),
premature ruptured membranes in 31 (8%), postdatism in 50 (13%),
preeclampsia  in 27 (7%),  and diabetes mellitus in five (1.3%).
Intrapartum complications included meconium in 62 (16%),  arrest
of labor in 64 (16%), oxytocin use in 85 (22%),  and fetal heart
rate decelerations in 28 (7%).  Two hundred ninety-seven  births
(76%) were spontaneous.  Forty-two low-forceps deliveries (10%),
12 mid-forceps deliveries (3%),  and 39 cesarean sections  (10%)
were done in the traditional labor and delivery suite. Puerperal
complications  included  one  uterine  inversion,   two cases of
placenta accreta, one rectovaginal fistula, and two requirements
of blood transfusion.  Neonatal morbidity included 22 low  Apgar
scores  (7%),   two  shoulder  dystocia,   three cytomegalovirus
infestations,  and one lethal anomaly.  Six infants had meconium
aspiration, two with severe hypoxia.  Any of these complications
would overwhelm the patient in  home  birth.   Intense  prenatal
screening  may  decrease some risk factors,  but the intrapartum
period was found to pose unacceptable risks for  home  birth  in
this population.

  In The Netherlands 34-35%  of all deliveries still take  place
at home, but with considerable regional differences. A study was
made  of  the  relation between the perinatal mortality rate and
the percentage of hospital deliveries in the 11 provinces of The
Netherlands,  in municipalities divided into groups according to
the  number of inhabitants,  and in the 17 cities with more than
100,000 inhabitants.  No relation could be demonstrated  between
the  regional percentage of hospital deliveries and the regional
perinatal mortality rate.  The proportion of  hospital  delivery
appears  not  to  be  a  major  factor  determining the regional
perinatal mortality rate in the current system of obstetric care
in The Netherlands.

  A  comparison  was  made  between  two  types   of   obstetric
organization: total hospitalization as in Denmark,  and a system
that  allows  a  choice  between  hospital  and  home  delivery,
provided  there  are  no  medical contra-indications,  as in The
Netherlands. Until the end of the 1950s,  the current Dutch view
prevailed  in  Denmark;  Denmark changed its organization in the
late 1960s and followed the international preference  for  total
hospitalization.   This  change  was not caused by disappointing
obstetric results, nor was it the result of strong pressure from
pregnant women.  The change was associated with  a  considerable
increase  in  instrumental  deliveries.   In  both countries the
perinatal mortality rate decreased continuously but  in  Denmark
the improvement in early neonatal mortality was slightly faster.
 This  difference  may  have  occurred  because  of insufficient
referral  in  The  Netherlands  of  high-risk  pregnancies   and
deliveries  to  the  fully  equipped obstetric departments.  The
Dutch acceptance of a high proportion  of  home-confinements  is
unlikely to be the explanation.

  Policies  about place of delivery have tended to be formulated
without  either  looking  at  existing  evidence  or  doing  new
research  into  the  relative  safety  for  women  and babies of
delivery in different settings.  This article reviews  published
research  on  the  subject,   and  finds  that  many of the data
required have not been collected.  Furthermore,   many  analyses
fail  to  take account of selection biases or differences in the
birthweight  distribution  and  the  incidence   of   congenital
malformations   among   babies   born   in  different  settings.
Nevertheless,  some tentative conclusions  can  be  drawn.   The
available  evidence does not support claims that,  for the baby,
the iatrogenic risks  of  obstetric  intervention  outweigh  the
possible  benefits.   At the same time,  there is no evidence to
support the  claim  that  the  shift  to  hospital  delivery  is
responsible  for  the  decline in perinatal mortality in England
and Wales nor the claim that the safest policy is for all  women
to be delivered in hospital.   (51 Refs.)

  Do obstetric intranatal interventions make birth safer?

  Impartial  analyses  of the evidence from official statistics,
national surveys and specific  studies  consistently  find  that
perinatal  mortality  is  much  higher when obstetric intranatal
interventions are used,  as in consultant hospitals,  than  when
they  are  little  used,   as in unattached general practitioner
maternity units and at home.  The conclusion  holds  even  after
allowance  has been made for the higher pre-delivery risk status
of hospital births as a  result  of  the  booking  and  transfer
policies. It holds even more strongly for births at high than at
low  predicted  risk.   It  follows  that  the  increased use of
interventions,  implied by increased hospitalization,  could not
have  been  the  cause  of the decline in the national perinatal
mortality rate over the last 50 years and analysis of results by
different methods confirms that the latter would  have  declined
more  in  the  absence  of the former.  Data are presented which
point  to  the  deleterious  effect  of  interventions  on   the
incidence  of  low  birthweight  and  short  gestation and their
associated mortality.  Also presented are  data  supporting  the
alternative  explanation  of the decline in perinatal mortality,
namely the improvement in the health status of mothers built  up
over  several  generations.   The  organization of the maternity
service stands indicted by the evidence.  Despite the beliefs of
those responsible, it has not promoted, and cannot promote,  the
objective of reducing perinatal mortality.

  The  low  birthweight (LBW)  rate among reported United States
non-White births increased 32 per cent from 1950 to 1967. States
with large increments in non-White LBW  rates  over  the  period
1950-67 ("rising LBW states")  were compared to states with more
stable  LBW  rates.   Paradoxically,   states  with   the   most
deterioration  in LBW rates had the most improvement in LBW risk
factors (low income, mothers under age 20 or over age 35,  birth
order  over four).  In 1950,  at least 9.7 per cent of non-White
births in rising LBW states went unreported,  and underreporting
was biased,  with out-of-hospital LBW births who die young least
likely  to  be  reported.   From  1950   to   1967,    non-White
out-of-hospital births for the US declined from 42 per cent to 7
per cent,  and yearly values for per cent of non-White births in
hospital and LBW rates were highly correlated (r =  .98).  These
data  suggest that the observed rise in non-White LBW rates from
1950 to 1967 was due in large part to systematic  underreporting
of  LBW births among non-White out-of-hospital deliveries in the
1950s.  This underreporting  essentially  ceased  when  hospital
delivery  for  non-Whites  became  nearly  universal in the late
1950s and 1960s.

  We conducted a survey of 1,064 out-of-hospital Kentucky births
during 1981 to 1983 in order to classify each by planning status
(planned  or unplanned to occur out of hospital)  and attendant.
Among the 809 births for which  we  obtained  information,   575
(71.1%)   were  planned.  We examined birth outcome by low birth
weight (LBW) and neonatal mortality (NM).  Compared with planned
births,  unplanned births were associated with increased risk of
LBW (odds ratio = 6.6; 95% confidence limits [CL],  3.9 to 11.2,
adjusted  for  maternal age).  Furthermore,  after adjusting for
maternal age and parity,   LBW  births  occurred  at  less  than
expected  frequency  among  planned births (observed to expected
[O:E] ratio = 0.48; 95% CL,  0.29 to 0.73),  but at greater than
expected frequency among unplanned births (O:E ratio = 2.9;  95%
CL, 2.2 to 3.8). A similar,  but nonsignificant,  trend was seen
for  NM and NM was much greater in the unplanned group (72.7 per
1,000 live births) than in the planned group (3.5 per 1,000).

  A  survey was carried out of all 8856 births occurring at home
in England and Wales in 1979.  Of these births,  67%   had  been
booked for delivery at home, 21% had been booked for delivery in
hospital, 3% had not been booked, and for 9%  the intended place
of delivery was unknown.  The perinatal mortality varied  almost
50-fold  according  to  the intended place of delivery,  ranging
from 4.1/1000 births in those booked for  delivery  at  home  to
196.6/1000 unbooked births. Deliveries that occurred at home but
had  been  booked for a hospital consultant unit were associated
with a perinatal mortality of 67.5/1000.  Births that  had  been
booked  for delivery at home included the smallest proportion of
babies of low birth weight: 2.5% weighed 2500 g or less compared
with 18%  of those booked for consultant units and 29%  of those
not  booked.   Within  these  low  birthweight groups there were
noticeable differences in perinatal mortality;  births booked to
occur  at  home had the lowest mortality and unbooked births had
the highest.  Perinatal mortality among babies who weighed  more
than 2500 g was generally low irrespective of the intended place
of delivery; the only exception was in babies whose delivery had
not   been  booked.   In  all  groups  perinatal  mortality  was
considerably higher in nulliparous  than  parous  women.   Women
booking  a  delivery  at home are clearly a selected group,  and
some may have been transferred to  hospital  during  labour  and
were thus not included in the survey.  Nevertheless,  these data
suggest that the perinatal  mortality  among  births  booked  to
occur at home is low, especially for parous women.

  The   observation   that   perinatal  mortality  among  babies
delivered at home has  tended  to  increase  beyond  that  among
babies  delivered in consultant obstetric units has caused alarm
and prompted recommendations that delivery  at  home  should  be
further  phased  out.  With data derived from the Cardiff Births
Survey the possibility was investigated that  this  trend  might
reflect  a  changing  ratio  of planned to unplanned domiciliary
births.  At the beginning of the 1970s deliveries at  home  that
were  planned to be so outnumbered those that were not by nearly
five to one.  By 1979 unplanned deliveries at  home  outnumbered
planned  deliveries.   The  characteristics of the mothers,  the
health care they received,  and the outcome of delivery differed
strikingly between planned and unplanned deliveries at home.  It
is concluded,  firstly,  that every year the maternity  services
must  try  to  meet  the  various  needs  of about 2000 women in
England and Wales who give birth at home without planning to  do
so; and, secondly,  that the heterogeneity of births at home and
in hospital will continue to obstruct the  search  for  unbiased
estimates  of  the  risks attributable to delivery in specialist
obstetric units, general practitioner units, and at home.

  Trends  in  out-of-hospital  births for the State of Michigan,
1972-79, were examined by analyzing (a)  location of deliveries,
(b) characteristics of the mother,  (c)  use of health services,
and (d)  characteristics  of  the  newborn.   A  large  increase
occurred  in the number of births at the mother's home and other
nonhospital sites for both the black and the white  populations.
For  white  women,   the  increase  was  associated  with better
education and greater use of prenatal care. Physician attendance
for deliveries at mother's home  declined.   Birth  weights  for
home-born infants increased significantly over the period,  more
so for whites than  for  blacks;   mortality  declined  in  some
groups,   especially  for  high-birth-weight  babies born at the
mother's home.  Assuming that the rise in  home  births  in  the
1970s was due to an increase in planned and not precipitate home
deliveries, the authors concluded that these trends reflect,  at
least in part,  the impact of  planned  out-of-hospital  births.
Toward  the  end  of the 1970s,  both the conditions under which
these births occurred and some of their  outcome  measures  were
more  characteristic  of  safety  than  at  the beginning of the
period. Disaggregation by race demonstrated,  however,  that the
safety  factor  was  not necessarily present for out-of-hospital
births of black infants.

  There  have  always been controversies on the pros and cons of
home delivery and childbirth in a  hospital.   During  the  Nazi
regime,   the official "health command"  policy monitored by the
Nazi party promoted home  delivery  under  midwife  supervision,
both  by  pertinacious propaganda and partly also by decrees and
ordinances.  The official  line  of  argument  against  clinical
obstetrics  consisted of a queer and highly questionable melange
of ideology and distored facts brought forward by the  so-called
"Reichsgesundheitsfuhrer" Dr. Leonardo Conti and his mother, Mrs
Nanna Conti as head of the Party-sponsored Midwives Association.
 The  "Midwives  Law"   was  promulgated  on  21  December  1938
prescribing compulsory  consultation  of  a  midwife  for  every
delivery.   By the end of 1939 gynaecologists eventually rallied
in protest against legislative  measures  to  restrict  clinical
obstetrics,   by  means  of  a  memorandum  penned by the German
Association for Gynaecology.  This memorandum was scheduled  for
circulation  among  all  the  members  of  the association.  The
pressure  exercised  by  this  memorandum  resulted   in   tough
negotiations  amounting  to a tug-of-war between representatives
of the German Association for Gynaecology and Dr.  Conti.   This
led eventually not only to an abandonment of the attacks against
clinical  obstetrics  but  also  to  an  official and unreserved
recognition   of   its   achievements.    In   addition,     the
"Reichsgesundheitsfuhrer"   issued  "Directives  for  regulating
obstetrics procedures" in 1940/41 in which it was laid down that
it would be left to the decision  of  the  expectant  mother  to
choose where she would prefer to deliver her child.

  The  efficacy  of  the  Dutch  system  of  obstetric  care was
investigated by comparison of the  outcomes  of  two  groups  of
supposedly  normal  first  pregnancies  and deliveries that were
solely cared for by midwives (n =  85)  or by gynecologists (n =
27). The outcome was measured by pH,  PCO2,  and base deficit in
arterial cord  blood  (early  morbidity)   and  by  neurological
examination   with   Prechtl's  method  (late  morbidity).   The
occurrence  of  10  neurologically  nonoptimal  infants  in  the
midwife  group is thought incompatible with the basis philosophy
of the Dutch obstetric system,  which is that midwives are  able
to  select  the normal pregnancies out of the group of women who
present for obstetric care and can  assist  in  maintaining  the
normal  state in these selected cases in the course of delivery.
The acid-base values were less favorable in  the  midwife  group
than  in  the gynecologist group.  Neurological nonoptimality in
the midwife group was related to acidosis.  The influence of the
site of birth (home or hospital--ambulatory)  could be virtually
ruled out.

  To  assess  the  significance  of  the  presence  of portal vein gas (PVG) in
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a retrospective study of all cases of NEC seen
at  Grady  Memorial  Hospital  between  July  1980 and June 1984 was conducted.
Infants  with PVG were compared with those without PVG with respect to clinical
presentation,  treatment,  and  outcome.  There  was  no significant difference
between  the  two  groups in birth weight, Apgar scores, or the age of onset of
NEC.  All  patients  received  standard  medical  therapy unless they developed
pneumoperitoneum,  had  a  positive  paracentesis,  or deteriorated in spite of
maximal  medical  treatment, in which case they had surgery. Of 97 infants with
"definite"  NEC,  55  (56%)  required  surgery. Twenty-one patients (22% of the
total) had PVG and 17 (81%) of them required surgery. Seventy-six patients (78%
of  total)  did  not  have  PVG and only 38 (50%) of them required surgery (P =
0.011).  Five (29%) of 17 infants with PVG had nearly total intestinal necrosis
compared  with  only  five  (13%, P = 0.25) of 38 infants without PVG. Patients 
with  PVG  had  a  lower overall survival rate (62% vs 88%, P = 0.009), medical
survival  rate (75% vs 97%, P = 0.184), and surgical survival rate (59% vs 79%,
P  =  0.19)  than  patients  without PVG. Infants weighing less than 1000 grams
fared worse regardless of the presence or absence of PVG. Portal vein gas is an
ominous   prognostic  sign.  It  signals  a  greater  likelihood  for  surgical
intervention,  a  more  extensive  bowel involvement, and a significantly lower
survival when compared to patients with NEC who do not have PVG.

  In  a  retrospective  study  over six years the incidence of phototherapy was
examined  in  two groups of healthy neonates who were born spontaneously and at
term  in  hospital.  They were comparable in all respects except that one group
was  cared  for  at  home  and  the  other  group was cared for in hospital. It
appeared  that  the  infants in hospital received phototherapy seven times more
often  than those at home, and surveillance at home was not inferior to that in
hospital.  There  is  no  reason to assume that neonatal jaundice occurred more
often in neonates in hospital than in those at home. Thus the difference in the
frequency  of treatment with phototherapy between the two groups is ascribed to
the influence of the hospital environment, which may encourage intervention.

  This  study  involves  775  cases  of  New  Jersey  residents who had planned
out-of-hospital  births during the years 1978-1980. Birth certificate data were
analyzed  and  compared  to  New  Jersey statewide birth data for the same time
period.  The  women  who chose a planned out-of-hospital birth were more likely
than  the  total  resident population to be older, married, better-educated and
having  their  second  baby.  Reasons  for  selecting alternatives to physician
in-hospital  delivery  were the desire to be attended by a midwife, to have the
family  present,  to  be  part of the decision-making process, and faith in the
birth  process  as  being  in  line  with  nature.  The  out-of-hospital  birth
phenomenon  was  diffuse  throughout  the  state,  with more births attended by
midwives  than  physicians  and  more  births  at  home rather than at birthing
centers.  This  study  provides  a  basis  for  comparison of specific choices,
providers  and  clientelle involved in the birth alternative movement, and lays
the  groundwork  for investigating long term changes in the demand for birthing
services in New Jersey.

  The  study  population included 337 adolescents and 876 mothers who delivered
live-born,  singleton  infants  in the Maternity and Infant Care Program at the
Minneapolis  Health  Department  between  1980-1982.  Whites  and blacks on the
average  experienced  menarche  1-2  years  earlier  than  the Southeast Asians
although  age of first pregnancy was 2 years later for the Southeast Asians. In
spite of the significantly later ages of entry into prenatal care, lower weight
gains,  and  hematocrits  among the Southeast Asians, compared to the white and
black populations, overall height-weight status on admission compared favorably
with  whites and blacks. The virtual absence of alcohol and tobacco consumption
among  the  Southeast  Asians may in fact contribute to the generally favorable
Apgar  scores,  length of gestation, and birth weights. The high frequencies of
alcohol  and  tobacco  consumption  among  white  adolescents  during pregnancy
suggest   the  need  for  more  intervention  to  discourage  smoking  in  this
population.  Further,  the  potential  adoption of these substances needs to be 
discouraged  among  the  Southeast Asian adolescents. While 2-4% of the whites,
blacks  and  Hmong  adolescents  experienced  eclampsia,  1% of the older Hmong
mothers  and none of the other Southeast Asians experienced eclampsia. The most
frequent complication for all groups was perineal laceration.

  Deliveries  outside of maternity hospitals in 1983 resulted in many high risk
newborns. In 40% of cases it occurred in lower socio-economic groups and in 60%
was  due  to lack of information with regards to recent progress in obstetrical
care.  The  presence  of  regional  emergency  services  (SAMU)  and  competent
pediatric  care,  has allowed for rapid transport and medical intervention. One
hundred  and  fifty  newborns  weighing  between  850  and  3,790 gms were thus
transported:  50%  were  of low birth weight, 63% born after 38 weeks gestation
and  37%  were  premature.  Hypothermia  was  common and details of labour were
unknown.  Despite  rapid  intervention,  there  were  9 deaths including 6 with
severe   neonatal   asphyxia.  Morbidity  was  related  to  socio-economic  and

  The  usefulness of a short electronic fetal heart rate recording at admission
of  patients in labor (admission test) was investigated in low-risk patients in
two prospective studies. The admission test was done in a concealed manner, and
the  result of the test was evaluated after delivery so as not to influence the
clinical  management. In part I of the investigation, the test was performed in
130  patients  monitored during labor with pH determinations in scalp blood and
in  cord  blood at birth. Patients with reactive admission tests had a low rate
of  intrauterine  asphyxia  in  labor (0.9%), whereas half of the patients with
ominous  traces  had  intrauterine fetal asphyxia with a low scalp blood pH and
neonatal  depression.  Similar  results  were  obtained  in  part  II, when the
admission  test  was used as a screening procedure involving 1041 patients. The
test was reactive in 94.3%, and in this group fetal distress (cesarean section,
or  forceps  on that indication, or an Apgar score less than 7 at five minutes)
occurred  in  1.3%.  Ten  patients  (1.0%) had ominous tests; four of these had 
fetal  distress,  and  one  of  these  fetuses  died in utero three hours after
admission,  during  which  time  stethoscopic auscultation failed to detect the
fetal  compromise.  It  is  concluded  that the admission test can detect fetal
distress already present at admission and unnecessary delay in intervention can
be  avoided  in  such a case. The test seems also to have some predictive value
for  the  fetal  well-being for the next few hours of labor. The test is simple
and convenient for screening purposes.

  A  prospective  trial  was  conducted  to compare the effects of conservative
management  of  prolonged pregnancy (conservative group) with routine induction
of  labour  at  42  weeks'  gestation (active group) in otherwise uncomplicated
pregnancies.  Of  the  402  pregnancies  studied,  207  (51%) were allocated to
conservative  management  and  195 (49%) were allocated to have labour induced.
The  groups  were well matched for age, parity, and smoking habits. One hundred
and  sixty  six  (80%)  of  the  patients  in  the conservative group went into
spontaneous labour. Of the remainder, two underwent elective caesarean section,
19  had  labour  induced  because of clinical concern, and the remaining 20 had
labour  induced at the patient's own request. One hundred and twenty five (64%)
of  the  patients in the planned active group underwent induction of labour. Of
the  remaining 70, 49 went into spontaneous labour and 21 (11%) asked that they
should  not  have  labour  induced.  Comparison  of  the  two  groups showed no
difference  in  the  length of the first stage of labour but a trend towards an
increased  need  for  intervention for fetal distress (p less than 0.06) in the 
active  group. There were no differences in the length of the second stage, the
need  for  intervention,  or the mode of delivery. In terms of Apgar scores the
neonatal  outcome was not significantly different between the two groups, but a
greater  proportion  of  the  babies  (15%  v  8%) in the active group required
intubation.  Umbilical  cord  venous  pH  estimated in the last 183 consecutive
deliveries  in  the study showed a significantly lower mean value in the active
group  (p  less than 0.05). There was no difference in birth weight between the
two  groups.  Two  deaths  occurred in the study. There was a stillbirth in the
conservative  group at 292 days after massive abruption, and one neonatal death
in the active group owing to multiple congenital abnormalities. The outcome for
mother  and  baby in patients from both groups who went into spontaneous labour
was  generally  good. The outcome for patients for whom conservative management
was  planned  but  induction  became  necessary  was  no different from that of
patients  who underwent planned induction at term. Thus from our results we can
find no evidence to support the view that women with normal prolonged pregnancy
should undergo routine induction of labour at 42 weeks' gestation.

  The  hypoplastic left heart syndrome: evidence of preoperative myocardial and

  From  February,  1983,  to  November,  1984, 11 infants with hypoplastic left
heart  syndrome  were managed medically prior to operative intervention. Only 2
of  the 11 infants appeared to be in mild distress at birth. Despite relatively
normal  Apgar  scores,  9  of the infants were seen in shock. All patients were
managed  medically  with  fluid  restriction, diuretics, and the institution of
prostaglandin  E1.  There  was  a marked improvement in arterial pH from a mean
value  of 7.13 prior to prostaglandin to 7.42 following prostaglandin infusion.
There  was  also  a dramatic decrease in the serum creatinine level from a mean
pretreatment  level of 1.5 mg/dl to 0.7 mg/dl following infusion. Ten of the 11
infants  were  operated  on  at  a mean age of 4 days with a Norwood or conduit
procedure.  Three  infants  who died at 3, 13, and 24 days of age had sustained
myocardial  infarctions  prior  to  operation. Three patients also had multiple
infarcts  of  the  liver.  Three  patients are alive 23, 22, and 6 months after
operation, and are growing and developing normally. The ability to maintain the
infant  with  hypoplastic left heart syndrome in a stable hemodynamic condition 
has  made  surgical  palliation  a  realistic  option  for this otherwise fatal
anomaly.  Nevertheless,  preoperative  infarctions  of  the  heart  and viscera
continue to play a major role in mortality.

  Hospital  alternative  birth  centers  (ABCs) were established in response to
consumer demands for 'family-centered maternity care'. This paper considers the
controversy  among  advocates  of  different childbirth alternatives, including
ABCs,  home  birth  and  conventional  hospital  birth.  The  expectations  and
evaluations of a sample of women who chose ABC births are compared to attitudes
towards  the  ABC  of  women  who selected home births or conventional hospital
births.  Women  who  choose  the ABC and those who select home birth share some
critical  views  of  conventional  labor and delivery, but not the same overall
ideology  of  childbirth.  Women  who  choose  the  ABC  and  women  who choose
conventional  labor  and  delivery  share  beliefs in the authority of hospital
obstetrics and the expertise of physicians.

  Traditional maternity care within a bio-social framework.

  This study, using quantitative and qualitative methodologies attempts to draw
a  profile  of  traditional  midwives  in  Botswana  through  describing  their
demographic characteristics, the patterns of communication between midwives and
patients,  their  knowledge and practices and their cooperation with the modern
maternity  care  sector. From the case study emerges a profile of a traditional
midwife  who:  is  socially  and  culturally integrated in the local community;
represents  a  highly valuable source of information on cultural conceptions of
crucial  importance to childbearing Botswana women; demonstrates the value of a
close  personal  interaction and communication with the pregnant and delivering
woman;  realizes  the limitations of her own capability in birthing situations;
and maintains a close communication with the local hospital to which she refers
patients when required. The traditional midwife described in this case study is
probably  not  a  prototype  of  the contemporary Motswana traditional midwife.
However,  she  does  represent  many  of  the  valuable  characteristics of the
traditional  approach which we in the modern sector might benefit from studying
in order to improve the human quality of our own care. On the basis of this and 
other  studies,  it is recommended that cooperation be developed between modern
and  traditional midwives, not with the intention of controlling or regulating,
but  to  respect  the  unique character of each. It appears that an open-minded
cooperation  between  two  independent  sectors  providing  health  care to the
childbearing  population  is  the optimal choice for the country at the present
time.  A  policy  for  the structured cooperation between the two sectors might
include  the  following:  Regional  education  seminars  for  both  modern  and
traditional midwives.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

  The  issue  of legalization of midwifery is distinct from that of sanctioning
of  home births. Ontario should seriously consider establishing midwifery as an
independent  profession  for  nondomiciliary  care. I hope that such a decision
would not be considered in isolation from the rest of the health care system.

  An  observational  study  was  done on the positions and breathing techniques
women  will  choose  for second-stage labor when they are given the freedom and
support  to choose. In the 50 second stages and births observed, nine different
positions were used in conjunction with three variations of expulsive breathing
techniques.  No  adverse outcomes resulted from the nonprescriptive approach to
birthing  women.  All  outcome  parameters were found to be within the range of
normal.  These  findings support the acceptability of allowing women to respond
to  their  birthing impulses. Further study is recommended to verify the safety
of a nondirective approach to birth.

  Apgar  scores  and  asphyxia.  Results of a study and proposal for a clinical

  The  Apgar  score (AS) was devised in 1953 as a simple system for classifying
neonatal  condition  at  1 minute and was later modified to include status at 5
minutes.  However,  studies  have  documented pitfalls, e.g. a poor correlation
between  AS  and acid-base status. We studied 35 infants born at term. ASs were
assigned  by  two  nurses  not  involved  in  the  delivery, and antepartum and
postpartum events were noted. We confirmed the following: (i) labour ward staff
tend  to  overestimate ASs; (ii) there is a poor correlation between the AS and
acid-base  status;  and  (iii)  the labour ward staff's decision to resuscitate
with  intermittent  positive-pressure respiration (IPPR) correlates with the AS
but  not  with  blood gas status. Infants with initially low ASs and/or a brief
requirement  for  IPPR  may  be  recorded  by medical or nursing staff as being
asphyxiated  at  birth.  Our  results  show that low ASs may be associated with
normal acid-base status and vice versa. In order further to define asphyxia, we
therefore  propose  that  a grading system which incorporates clinical data and
the AS be used. Use of such a system would facilitate inter-area comparisons of 
grades  of  asphyxia  encountered,  efficacy  of  intervention  programmes  and
developmental outcome of asphyxiated neonates.

  An  examination  of  908  fetal  heart rate tests of 418 consecutive patients
revealed  brief  variable  decelerations  in  more  than 50.7% of the patients.
Although an association existed with nuchal cord location found at delivery, no
association  existed  between these variable decelerations and fetal heart rate
decelerations during labor, low Apgar scores at birth, or birth weight. We find
no  evidence  to  suggest that these brief variable decelerations are a sign of
fetal compromise or an indication for obstetric intervention.

  Thirty-two  infants  were  treated for congenital diaphragmatic hernia at our
institution  from  1979  to 1984. Eight were in no or minimal distress at birth
and  had operative intervention when they were more than 24 hours old; survival
was   100%.  The  remaining  24  neonates  required  immediate  intubation  and
ventilation  followed  by  operation  at  less  than  12  hours of age. Overall
survival  was  54%;  survival  was 31% (4 of 13 patients, Group 1) in the first
three years of the series and 82% (9 of 11 patients, Group 2) in the last three
years  (p  less  than  0.001).  Apgar score, gestational age, birth weight, and
incidence  of associated congenital heart disease were equal for the two groups
(all, p greater than 0.05). The two groups also were examined with reference to
alveolar-arterial  oxygen  differences P(A-a)O2 and mean airway pressure (MAP).
The  best  preoperative  P(A-a)O2  was greater than 600 mm Hg for 7 neonates in
Group  1  and  6  in Group 2, and survival was 0% and 71%, respectively (p less
than  0.001).  Infants  with  a postoperative MAP of 13 cm H2O or greater had a
higher mortality (100% in Group 1 and 50% in Group 2, p greater than 0.05). Our
treatment  protocol  was studied to determine those methods related to improved 
survival.  Sodium  bicarbonate  infusion  was  used  earlier  in  Group  2 as a
prophylaxis  against  persistent fetal circulation (PFC) (p greater than 0.05).
The  incidence  of  severe  PFC  dropped  from 85 to 54% (p greater than 0.05).
Higher  ventilator  rates  rather  than  pressures were used to achieve equally
effective ventilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

  A   randomized   prospective  controlled  trial  of  an  automatic  feed-back
controlled  oxytocin  infusion system (AIS) for the induction of labour at term
was carried out in three hospitals. In primiparae, a four-fold reduction in the
total  dose  of oxytocin infused, for the same induction-delivery interval, was
achieved  with  the AIS compared with standard labour ward protocols relying on
midwife  control  of  oxytocin  infusion rate. In multiparae, the total dose of
oxytocin  infused  was  almost  halved  when  the  AIS was used, while the mean
duration  of  labour was increased by 1.6 h to 7.5 h. There were no differences
in the mode of delivery or Apgar scores. It is concluded that the AIS is a safe
technique  for  induction  of labour. Its use has demonstrated that term labour
can be induced efficiently with a mean oxytocin infusion rate between 2.5 and 3
mU/min (max 8.8 mU/min) and a total oxytocin dose infused of less than 5 U.

  Information  on 555 Aboriginal births which occurred during 1981 and 1982 was
forwarded  by  midwives  to  the  South  Australian  perinatal statistics unit.
Corresponding  information was also supplied for all other births in the state.
This information showed that Aboriginal women appear to have a higher fertility
rate than do other women, particularly in the teenage years. Aboriginal mothers
are  very young and have a high parity. They appear to receive little antenatal
care and there is a greater tendency for their pregnancies to be complicated by
medical   conditions,  such  as  anaemia,  urinary  tract  infections,  cardiac
disorders  and  diabetes.  Post-partum  haemorrhages and retained placentas are
relatively  common,  as are genital tract infections after delivery. Aboriginal
babies   are   characterized   by  low  birthweights,  low  Apgar  scores,  and
prematurity.  There  is  an  indication  that Aboriginal babies may have a high
perinatal  mortality  rate  in  the  country  areas  of  South Australia. It is
intended  that  this information be used as a baseline for evaluating trends in
the health status of Aborigines.

  Between  October 1980 and July 1981, 1,878 women were attended by traditional
birth  attendants (TBAs) at four obstetric units in rural areas surrounding the
city of Fortaleza in Northeast Brazil. Of these women, 232 (12.4 per cent) were
referred to a hospital in Fortaleza for delivery. The most important indicators
for  referral  to hospital were: presence of an antenatal problem, complication
of  labor,  or  malpresentation. Based on record review, 65 referred women with
none  of these conditions were classified as low risk and 42 women not referred
were  classified  as  high risk (at least one such condition present). Of 1,878
deliveries,  32  (17 per 1,000) terminated as fetal deaths, and 12 infants died
before  discharge  from  hospital  or obstetric unit (six per 1,000). The death
rate  was  much higher for the high-risk cases (156 per 1,000 referrals, 95 for
nonreferrals). Although some women may have been inappropriately referred while
others  who  should  have  been  were  not referred, the system of referral has
allowed  TBAs  to  attend  uncomplicated  deliveries  and  to  refer women with
complications.

  Perinatal  asphyxia  may  occur  prior to or at the time of birth, leading to
hypoxia  and  acidosis  with  persistence  of  the  fetal  circulatory pattern.
Resuscitation  facilitates  transition  to  the  adult  circulatory  pattern by
restoring  normal  oxygenation,  ventilation,  and perfusion. Assessment of the
degree  of  asphyxia  should  utilize the Apgar score, and resuscitation should
proceed  in  a  stepwise  fashion  to  an  extent  determined  by the degree of
depression.  Aspects  of  resuscitation  unique to the newborn are reviewed, in
addition to situations requiring specific intervention.  (19 Refs.)

  Intensive  interviews  with  licensed  lay midwives in one of ten states that
have  recently  reactivated and revised legislation legalizing such alternative
practitioners  for  low  risk clientele revealed a number of obstacles to their
practice.  The  obstacles stem from the same rules and regulations developed by
medical  practitioners  that  made  their  homebirth  service legal. Even after
surmounting  the  difficulties  of  obtaining  a  license,  the  midwives  find
widespread  unwillingness  among  private  physicians  to  provide the required
prenatal   screening   examination  and  medical  back-up.  The  opposition  of
physicians  to  the  licensed  midwifery  program is voiced in terms of concern
about  the  safety of homebirths, particularly those attended by nonphysicians.
Yet,  the  outcomes  from  the first 4 years of the program give no support for
such  concerns.  Physician  reluctance  to  cooperate  with  the legal program,
combined  with  restrictions  prohibiting  the  licensed midwives from suturing
minor  tears  and  administering a single dose of an antihemorrhagic drug in an
emergency  transfer, do compromise the overall quality of midwifery care. While
accepting their subordinate position to medical practitioners, the midwives are
struggling  to  establish  the continuum of care for homebirth women implied in 
their licensure law.

  Among  7052 patients studied between 1976 and 1982 in a collaborative project
on  antepartum  fetal  heart  rate  monitoring,  337  patients  had  a previous
stillbirth  as  a  reason  for  testing.  Overall a previous stillbirth history
significantly  increased  the risk of having a positive result on a contraction
stress  test,  primarily  among hypertensive patients. Patients with a previous
stillbirth  also  had  a significantly higher incidence of respiratory distress
syndrome  in their neonates attributable to premature intervention for maternal
indications  (primarily  among  hypertensive  women  and patients with clinical
intrauterine   growth   retardation).   Low  Apgar  scores  were  found  to  be
significantly increased in diabetics with previous stillbirths primarily due to
neonates   with  congenital  malformations.  Premature  intervention  by  labor
induction  or  cesarean  section was more common among patients with a previous
stillbirth  for  both  maternal indications and abnormal antepartum fetal heart
rate  studies.  Previous  stillbirth would appear therefore to be a significant
risk  factor  primarily  when  associated  with  a diagnosis of hypertension or
clinical intrauterine growth retardation.

  The  detection of women with obstetric high-risk factors is now recognized as
a  major  aim  of antenatal care, especially in developing countries, and those
factors  most  important  in  Papua  New  Guinea  obstetric  practice have been
identified by a study of maternal deaths. The present study aimed to assess the
value  of  the  detection  of  these  factors  by  comparing  the  outcomes  of
pregnancies  with  and  without  high  risk  factors.  Home,  health centre and
hospital  deliveries  in two districts of Enga Province in the Papua New Guinea
Highlands  were  studied. Of the total 2225 deliveries, 74% took place at home,
the  proximity  of  a  health centre appearing to be a major determinant in the
choice  between home or supervised institutional delivery. Fifty-three per cent
of  women  had  at  least  one  high risk factor, and 92% of these factors were
historical.  Eighty-two per cent of women had an uncomplicated normal delivery,
while post-partum haemorrhage was the commonest complication, occurring in 7.6%
of  deliveries.  This complication also caused all 4 maternal deaths. There was
good  correlation  between delivery complications and the presence of high-risk
factors, 70% of complications occurring in at-risk pregnancies. It is concluded
that  the  detection of high-risk factors in pregnancy is very worthwhile. But, 
as  a  separate  study  has  shown,  the rate of detection antenatally could be
improved,  and until more health centres are constructed it will probably prove
difficult to persuade all those at high risk to deliver under supervision.

  This  paper  describes  the characteristics of thriving and failure to thrive
(FTT)  children  and  their  mothers  and examines the effect of short-term lay
health  visitor intervention in cases of nonorganic failure to thrive (NO FTT).
Twenty-five  FTT  children  and  mothers  received  lay  health  visitor  (LHV)
intervention in addition to other community and medical treatment; 25 other FTT
children  and  mothers did not receive the LHV intervention but did receive all
other  medical  and  community  treatment.  Twenty-five  thriving  children and
mothers  were matched with the FTT children and mothers in the LHV group on the
child's  age at intake, sex, birth weight, and the mother's age, ethnicity, and
number  of  living children. At initial assessment, the FTT and thriving groups
were  found  to  be  comparable  on  demographic  factors,  infant birth weight
percentiles,   apgar  scores,  complications  of  pregnancy  or  delivery,  and
separations  in the newborn period. There were more premature births in the LHV
group  although  the  proportion  of  premature births for the FTT and thriving
groups  overall  were  similar.  A  majority  of  mothers in the FTT groups had
negative  memories  of  childhood  in contrast to more positive memories in the 
thriving  group.  At initial assessment, the majority of thriving children were
developmentally  normal  and  had increased from their birth weight percentiles
whereas   all  of  the  FTT  children  had  decreased  from  their  birthweight
percentiles  and  over  half  were  developmentally  delayed.  There were clear
differences  in  mother-child  interaction  patterns  in  the  thriving and FTT
groups.  Three patterns of interaction were identified in the FTT group: benign
neglect,  incoordination,  and  overt hostility. Intervention had no measurable
effect  on  the child's weight, development, or interaction patterns. Only 8 of
37  FTT children reevaluated 6 months later showed "catch up" growth and only 7
had  improved  in  developmental  score  category. Patterns of interaction were
found to persist over the 6

  Ranitidine  150  mg  orally  was  given every 6 hours to 909 women in labour,
while  a  control  group  of 378 women received conventional alkali therapy. No
differences  in  incidences  of  operative intervention, placental retention or
post-partum  haemorrhage  were observed between groups. Gastric sampling during
emergency  anaesthesia  revealed  a  pH  less  than 2.5 in four of 51 women who
received  ranitidine and in two of 31 women who received magnesium trisilicate.
Gastric volumes were slightly lower (mean 83 ml) in the study group than in the
control  group  (mean  122  ml).  Absorption  of  ranitidine was greatly slowed
following  narcotic  administration and gastric volume was significantly higher
in  those patients given narcotics in labour. Apgar scores were similar in both
groups  of  infants,  and  babies whose mothers were given ranitidine showed no
delay   in  achieving  high  gastric  acidity  and  no  increase  in  bacterial
colonization of the gastro-intestinal tract. Low levels only of ranitidine were
found  in  the  blood  of  babies at 2-3 hours and approximately 12 hours after
birth.

  Perinatal  observations in a high-risk population managed without intrapartum

  Intrapartum  fetal scalp blood pH studies remain controversial in obstetrics.
Electronic   fetal   monitoring,  by  contrast,  has  achieved  nearly  uniform
acceptance. Controlled comparative studies from one institution are unlikely to
provide  adequate numbers. Intrapartum fetal monitoring is used consistently at
our   institution.  Fetal  health  is  assessed  by  monitoring  criteria,  and
intervention  occurs  only  for  obstetric  or monitoring indications. With the
presumption  that  intrapartum  compromise  and  its management will usually be
reflected  in  early neonatal findings, three recent years of perinatal results
in  a  predominantly high-risk population of over 7100 deliveries are reported.
Comparisons  are made to results of other similar populations managed elsewhere
with  and without pH studies. Absence of pH studies did not appear to result in
extraordinary   rates   of  stillbirth,  operative  intervention,  or  neonatal
compromise.  The  data  are offered for interest but cannot by themselves prove
the lack of worth of a test not used.

  Necrotizing  enterocolitis  (NEC)  is commonly thought of as occurring in the
sick  premature infant, usually in the first one to two weeks of life. A review
of NEC at the Children's Hospital of Denver over a 5-year period, found that 13
of  79  infants  (16.1%)  had  onset of NEC during the first day of life. These
infants  were  larger  (mean  birth  weight 2,624 +/- 849 g), more mature (mean
gestational  age  37.9  +/- 2.5 weeks), and less asphyxiated as judged by Apgar
scores  (mean  five-minute  score 8.15 +/- 1.07) than infants with onset of NEC
after  the  first  day  of  life  (mean  birth  weight  1,519  +/-  586 g, mean
gestational  age  32.0  +/-  3.5  weeks, P less than .001, and mean five-minute
Apgar  score  6.81  +/-  1.84,  P  less than .05). Despite their large size and
degree  of  maturity,  eight of these infants (62%) showed signs of respiratory
distress;  four  (31%)  were  polycythemic;  four (31%) had either a partial or
double-volume  exchange  transfusion  performed; and 11 (85%) were fed prior to
developing  NEC.  Presenting  signs  of  disease,  occurrence  of sepsis (31%),
requirement  for  surgical intervention (62%), and mortality (30%) were similar
for  the two groups of infants. It is suggested that term and near-term infants
who  have  significant  illness  after  delivery  be  treated  more  like their 
premature counterparts with cautious introduction of feedings after an adequate
period of stabilization.

  Due  to  the  progress  in  obstetrics  during  the  past  20  years hospital
deliveries are becoming considerable less risk for mother and child if compared
with  prior  times. On the other hand, individual emotional needs of mother and
child  are  supposed  to be relatively more attainable at home deliveries. From
the  movement  to  deliver  at home obstetrician should learn how to achieve an
emotional  atmosphere  during  hospital  delivery.  Finally we may suggest as a
compromise  between home and hospital deliveries, out patient management of the
same.

  This  paper  presents  an  analysis  of  the  risk perceptions of a sample of
pregnant  women  in  a  large  metropolitan  area  on  the West Coast regarding
childbirth  and its medical management, and how these perceptions correspond to
their  choice  of  childbirth  service.  The  analysis  first summarizes recent
experimental  work in cognitive and social psychology on information processing
in  decision  making  and  examines  its  usefulness  for  the study of women's
reproductive  strategies in real life contexts. Following this, perceived risks
of  childbirth  and  its  management  are  examined  in light of the concept of
'bolstering',  advanced in Janis and Mann's conflict theory of decision making.
The  findings,  that  women  discount the risks and magnify the benefits of the
chosen  birth  service, and exaggerate the risks and minimize the advantages of
the  rejected services, support the concept of bolstering and provide empirical
evidence   of   its   explanatory  power  in  interpreting  a  decision  making
domain--women's  childbirth  care decision making--heretofore approached almost
exclusively through description.

  The effect and safety of segmental epidural analgesia (SEA) were investigated
in three groups of parturients totaling 250. Three comparative groups were also
created. In 50 primigravidae, the analgesic effect was good in 90%, moderate in
8%,  and  poor in only 2%. The opinion of midwives on analgesic effect was also
similar.  Investigation  of  the  duration of labor showed that the duration of
both  first  and  second  stages  was  longer in SEA groups than in nonepidural
groups.  However,  with  more  liberal  use  of  oxytocin in the SEA group this
difference  disappeared.  The  SEA  did not lead to more malpositions than were
present  in  the  nonepidural  groups.  Nevertheless,  the rate of instrumental
deliveries  was  approximately  three  times  higher  in the SEA groups than in
nonepidural  groups  (15.2%  vs  4.7%, respectively). No difference between the
groups occurred when Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were investigated.

  Cerebral  palsy and mental retardation in relation to indicators of perinatal

  Although  intrapartum  asphyxia  is  established  as  an  important  cause of
perinatal  loss,  there  is  little  consensus  as to how much of the burden of
neurologic  handicap  in  the  community  is  attributable  to  intrapartum and
neonatal   asphyxia,   as  measured  clinically.  A  review  of  the  available
epidemiologic  information  suggests  that  the role of perinatal events in the
genesis  of  severe  mental  retardation  and cerebral palsy is not as large as
popularly  thought.  Of  all  neurologic  handicaps,  cerebral  palsy bears the
closest relationship to adverse perinatal events, but at least 50% of all cases
have  no documented depression at the time of birth. No more than 15% of severe
mental  retardation  can  be  attributed  to  perinatal  events.  Severe mental
retardation  without cerebral palsy does not appear to be attributable to birth
asphyxia.  The  majority  of  even  quite severely asphyxiated babies suffer no
detectable   neurologic   or   intellectual   sequelae.   These   epidemiologic
observations suggest that resuscitative efforts in mature newborn infants ought
not  to  be  too quickly abandoned for fear of late sequelae. At the same time, 
obstetric intervention based solely on concern for later neurologic development
cannot  be  justified.  The  most  appropriate  justification for antenatal and
intrapartum  monitoring  of fetal condition are the established associations of
indicators  of fetal asphyxia with fetal and neonatal death, and with morbidity
in the neonatal period.

  Results  from a previous epidemiologic study indicate that marijuana use near
term  may  elevate risk of abnormal progress of labor and meconium staining. We
conducted  a  study  of  the  association  of  self-reported  marijuana use and
perinatal  problems  in  a series of 313 women enrolled in a home-birth center.
The  41  marijuana  users  were  similar  to  non-users  with  respect  to most
potentially  confounding factors, but users had lower mean income and exhibited
more tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy than non-users. Users experienced
slightly  elevated  rates  of  dysfunctional  labor (43% vs. 35% in non-users),
precipitate labor (13% vs. 8%) and meconium staining (17% vs. 13%); differences
with  respect  to most other outcomes were smaller or nonexistent. The observed
differences  were  smaller  in  both  relative  and  absolute  terms than those
reported  by  the  earlier  study,  and were little changed upon adjustment for
potentially  confounding  factors (including alcohol use, cigarette use, parity
and  income).  After  accounting  for statistical variation, the results appear 
consistent with the earlier findings but further research is recommended.

  In  1978,  Arizona began licensing lay midwives under regulations designed to
maintain  adequate  standards  of  care for women desiring a home birth. During
four  years of this program, 3 per cent of home birth clients were hospitalized
for  complications  and another 15 per cent received postnatal outpatient care,
primarily for second degree lacerations. Five per cent of the newborns required
medical  care  after  delivery;  half of these were hospitalized. Complications
declined  over  the  period due to increased experience, close supervision, and
continuing education.

  It  has  been  widely  reported  that  adolescent  mothers are more likely to
experience poor pregnancy outcome, especially low-birth-weight and/or premature
infants.  Recent  data  suggest  that  this  poor  outcome may be attributed to
confounding health and social characteristics of adolescent mothers. A study of
maternal  health  and  neonatal development at Boston City Hospital provided an
opportunity  to  assess  whether adolescent mothers deliver infants with poorer
outcomes at birth than nonadolescents independent of numerous social and health
differences  between  adolescent  and  nonadolescent  mothers.  A  total of 275
infants of primiparous adolescents (aged 13 to 18 years) were compared at birth
with  423  infants  of  primiparous  nonadolescents.  Size  at birth, length of
gestation, Apgar scores, and birth trauma were examined. The only statistically
significant  difference  between  the  two  groups  was that adolescent mothers
delivered  infants  whose  mean  weight  was  94  g less (P less than .03) than
infants  of  nonadolescent  mothers.  Multiple and logistic regression analyses
demonstrated that several health and social factors, but not adolescent status, 
were  independently  associated  with the measures of adverse infant outcome. A
subsequent  regression  analysis  demonstrated  similarly  that being a younger
adolescent  (16  years  and  younger)  did  not independently predict low birth
weight  at  delivery  or  other  measured adverse neonatal outcomes. These data
support  the  view  that  health  and social factors are more important to poor
fetal  outcome  among  primiparous  mothers than adolescent status. Some of the
health factors are amenable to clinical intervention.

  Obstructed labor due to a large sacrococcygeal tumor is reported. A technique
of  transabdominal  intrauterine  reduction  in  the size of the tumor to allow
delivery  of  the infant in satisfactory condition is described. The method and
the  successful outcome have not previously been reported. It is recommended as
a  combined obstetric and pediatric surgical solution to similar complications.
The  complication  should  be  circumvented  by  ultrasonographic  screening of
high-risk  or  suspect  cases and of women entering a high-risk environment for
delivery.

  At  Akershus  Central  Hospital the main indication for induction of labor is
post-term pregnancy, and induction is carried out by i.v. oxytocin drip. During
3 years between 1974 and 1977, labor was induced in 11.6% of all births in this
hospital.  Thirty  per  cent of first induction attempts were unsuccessful; the
success  rates,  implying  labor  contractions  and  delivery  consequent  upon
induction,  were slightly higher among mothers of parities 1 + than among those
giving  birth for the first time. Most of the induced births took place between
noon  and 8 p.m. In a case-control study of post-term inductions of live single
fetuses  in  cephalic  presentation, comprising 721 sets of cases and controls,
unreliable  term  dating  was  more  frequent  among induced than among control
mothers,  significantly  so  in the para 1 + group. Mothers requiring induction
were slightly shorter and slightly heavier than those with spontaneous onset of
labor, and pregnancy hypertension was more frequent among the former. Labor was
of  shorter  duration  in induced cases than in those with labor of spontaneous
onset,  and  operative  intervention  during  delivery  was  significantly more
frequent  in  the  induction  groups.  Birth  weight and crown-heel length were 
similar in the two groups, but Apgar scores of the infants born after induction
were  significantly lower than of those born after spontaneous labor, at both 1
and  5  minutes.  While  the frequency of diseases and injuries in the newborns
were  similar,  more  children  born  after  induction  were transferred to the
intensive  care  unit.  There  was  a striking preponderance of boys born after
induction,  both  to  para  0  and  para 1 + mothers. In spite of matching, the
comparability of cases and controls is always an object of criticism in studies
like  this one. Therefore, although the information obtained is valuable, there
is a need for large-scale randomized studies on induction of labor.

  We  have carried out the experiment about the use of "obstetric chairs" on 31
women  in  labour.  There were no obstetric complications for any woman. In all
cases  the  delivery  was  spontaneous  and the patients appreciated the new of
delivery  very  much. The fetus did not show any complication either during the
labour or during the alter-birth period. All cases showed a high Apgar - score.
The  fetal  heart  rate  monitoring didn't record any FHR changes. The midwives
didn't  point  out  any difficulty about the delivery management. These results
encourage, to continue this experience.

  From  a group of 8,020 well-documented and electronically recorded deliveries
at  the  Tubingen University Gynaecological Clinic during 1976-1979 we selected
1147  (14.3%)  according  to  strict  criteria  and  subjected  them to further
analysis.  These  1147  pregnant  women had one feature in common, namely, that
there  were absolutely no signs of any risk factor prior to delivery (Table 1).
Result: 83% only of these children were delivered spontaneously; in 0.8% of the
cases  it  was  necessary  to  effect  Caesarean  section,  and  in another 15%
vaginal-surgical  delivery  proved  necessary.  In  10% threatening and in 0.9%
acute  foetal asphyxia was the guiding sign for appropriate obstetric measures.
In  31.4%  of  the cases we found a twisted cord, whereas the frequency rate of
acidosis  (pHNA  less than 7100) was 7%. Apgar counts below 7 were seen in 2.3%
and indices below 3 in 0.1% of the cases. Perinatal mortality was approximately
1:1000.  Complications  requiring  follow-ups  were seen in the first week post
partum in every 20th child. It is concluded that domiciliary obstetric practice 
cannot  be  medically recommended since it involves a risk rate for both mother
and child which is considered too high.

  This  study includes, 1,542 patients who underwent nonstress tests (NSTs) for
primary  fetal surveillance and 4,626 patients who underwent contraction stress
tests  (CSTs) for primary fetal surveillance. All pregnancies were at increased
risk  for  uteroplacental insufficiency. The results showed that the two groups
were  comparable  according  to maternal diagnostic criteria for testing. Those
patients  who  underwent  NSTs  as primary surveillance had a 2.9% incidence of
intervention  because  of  abnormal test results while the CST group had a 4.5%
incidence of intervention because of abnormal test results ( p less than 0.05).
The   NST   group   had   significantly  more  respiratory  distress  syndrome,
intrauterine  growth retardation, birth weight less than 2,500 gm, and 5-minute
Apgar  scores  less  than  7.  The  antenatal death rate was nearly eight times
higher  in  the NST group (7.8/1,000 versus 1.1/1,000 in the CST group) (p less
than 0.05). After correction for congenital anomalies and unrelated causes, the
NST  group had an antenatal death rate of 3.2/1,000 versus 0.4/1,000 in the CST 
group (p less than 0.05); there was still an antenatal death ratio of 8:1.

  Out-of-hospital birth centers are controversial. A retrospective chart review
was  performed  for 150 consecutive patients who had their prenatal care at The
Birthplace,  a  Seattle  birth center with certified nurse-midwives licensed by
the  state  of  Washington.  Seventy-two percent of the women were nulliparous.
Antepartum  or  intrapartum  hospital  referral  was  necessary  for 28% of the
patients.  An  additional  17%  of  the patients would have been transferred if
specific  written  criteria  for  transfer  had  been  precisely  followed. The
cesarean  section rate was 6% (9 of 150). Nonoptimal 1-minute Apgar scores of 6
or  less  were  more  common  in  nulliparas  (20%) than in multiparas (3%) who
delivered at The Birthplace (P less than .05). All 5-minute Apgar scores were 7
or  more.  Three infants had birth weights less than 2500 g. Noncompliance with
the   transfer   criteria   was  associated  with  untoward  outcome.  Patients
considering  out-of-hospital  delivery  should be counseled that a high rate of
hospital transfer is necessary to minimize risk.

  Twenty  home  birth  patients referred for hospital management were reviewed.
Eleven mothers were referred in labour and nine infants in the first week after
birth.  The  clinical  presentation  and  neonatal  outcome  are described. The
majority  had  antenatal  factors  suggesting increased perinatal risk. Careful
patient  selection,  prompt  detection and early referral of complications, and
adequate  facilities for infant resuscitation should minimise the risks of home
birth.  More  research  is required on the population requesting home birth and

  A  controlled  clinical  trial comparing early closure (mean = 48.8 hours) of
the  patent  ductus  arteriosus  using  indomethacin  to  conventional  medical
management, with intervention only after cardiopulmonary decompensation (mean =
167.4  hours),  was  undertaken  in  24 preterm infants with severe respiratory
distress  syndrome  and  evidence  of PDA. An interval analysis of one-half the
projected  sample revealed that infants undergoing early closure of the PDA had
significantly  reduced  occurrence  of  BPD  or mortality by 6 months of age. A
comparison  of  birth weight, Apgar scores, gestational age, age of initial PDA
diagnosis,  and  fluid  therapy  during  the first seven days of life showed no
significant  differences  between early intervention and control groups. At the
time  of the interval analysis, there were no differences between the groups in
duration of intermittent mandatory ventilation or oxygen exposure. Studies will
be  required  to  determine whether these and other variables can be altered by
early closure of the PDA.

  Transcutaneous  nerve stimulation (TNS) was applied to 100 parturients with a
view  of  decreasing pain during labour. A control group of 100 parturients was
randomly  selected.  Two  hours  after  delivery the mothers and their midwives
independently   completed   questionnaires   regarding   the   pain  which  was
subjectively   quantified,   during   the   different  stages  of  labour.  The
distribution  of  age  and  parity  of the mothers, the duration of labour, and
Apgar  score  of  the neonates at one minute were comparable in the two groups.
The  desire for and administration of analgesic agents was equal in each group.
Significantly  more  mothers  in  the  TNS  group reported that labour had been
moderately or intensively painful compared to the control group during cervical
dilatation from 1--7 cm. After this degree of dilation the subjective judgement
regarding  pain  were  the  same in both groups. The expectation of pain during
labour,  as well as the experience of pain compared to expectation, was similar
in  both groups. Thirty-one of the mothers in the TNS group considered the pain
relieving  affect  of the TNS good and 55 considered it moderate. Thirty-two of
the  mothers  in the TNS group wanted a more efficient analgesic method for the 
next labour.

  Continuous  monitoring  tracings of fetal heart rate in 61 infants with birth
weights  of  1,500  grams or less were analyzed and related to newborn outcome.
Reassuring  heart  rate  patterns  or good baseline variability correlated well
with  a  normal  unbilical  artery  pH.  Fetal heart rate patterns and baseline
variability  were  not  related  in  a predictive way to central nervous system
hemorrhage,   respiratory   distress   syndrome,   or   neonatal  death.  Early
intervention and operative delivery in cases demonstrating abnormal fetal heart
rate  patterns  may  have  influenced the outcome in these infants. Fetal heart
rate  patterns  can play an important role in the intrapartum assessment of the
condition  of  the very-low-birth-weight infant and may be used to select those
infants   requiring   prompt   operative  intervention  and  vigorous  neonatal
resuscitation.

  A  group  of 27 premature fetuses, between 27 and 35 weeks of gestation, were
studied in the fetal intensive care unit. Both late deceleration of fetal heart
rate  and  loss  of  beta  to beat variation were associated with significantly
lower  Apgar  scores.  Four  of  5  of  the  very premature fetuses who died of
asphyxia  soon after birth, showed evidence of asphyxia in the fetal heart rate
trace  before  birth.  Because of the improved short- and long-term outlook for
the   liveborn   very  premature  fetus,  active  obstetric  intervention  when
intrauterine asphyxia is diagnosed may furthther improve survival rate.

  Advocates  of  home  birth  cite  psychological and medical benefits in their
demand for a different approach to birthing procedures. Opponents emphasize the
risks  of this approach and point to improved outcomes through medical progress
available  only  in  hospitals,  as  well  as to recent, less positive European
attitudes  toward  home  births.  A review of the literature shows that present
data  are  limited  and  do  not  conclusively  support  either  opinion. It is
essential  that the medical profession become actively involved in an objective
analysis  of  the  merits and deficiencies of home and hospital birth settings.
This participation should ensure that new approaches to birth will maintain the
highest possible standards in maternal, fetal, and neonatal welfare.
