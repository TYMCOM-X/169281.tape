  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  CHEMISTRY
  [3115]  Rho(D)   immune  globulin is a sterile,  concentrated,
nonpyrogenic solution of immunoglobulins prepared from plasma or
serum of adults with a high titer of anti-Rho(D) antibody to the
red blood cell antigen Rho(D).
  STABILITY
  [3345] Rho(D)  immune globulin should  be  stored  at  2-8DGC;
freezing  should  be  avoided.   [3303,3515] Solutions of Rho(D)
immune globulin which have been frozen should not be used.
  TEXT:
  CHEMISTRY
  [3113] The solution contains 10-18% protein, of which not less
than 90%  is immunoglobulin G (gamma  globulin,   IgG).   [3410]
Rho(D)   immune globulin contains glycine as a stabilizing agent
and thimerosal as a preservative;  pH is  adjusted  with  sodium
carbonate  or  sodium  chloride.  [3113] Plasma or serum used in
preparation of Rho(D)  immune globulin  has  been  shown  to  be
negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
  Commercially available Rho(D)  immune globulin meets standards
established by the Office of Biologics of the US Food  and  Drug
Administration.   [3580] Rho(D)  immune globulin is commercially
available as a standard dose of Rho(D)  immune globulin and as a
microdose of Rho(D) immune globulin. Each vial of Rho(D)  immune
globulin (standard dose) contains enough anti-Rho(D) to suppress
the immunization  potential  of  15  mL  of  Rho(D)-positive  or
Du-positive  packed red blood cells (not whole blood),  and each
vial of Rho(D)  immune  globulin  (microdose)   contains  enough
anti-Rho(D)  to suppress the immunization potential of 2.5 mL of
Rho(D)-positive or Du-positive packed red blood cells (not whole
blood) or the equivalent (5 mL) of whole blood in males.
  STABILITY
  [3303] Although Rho(D) immune globulin should be refrigerated,
the manufacturers state that the drug may be stable for up to 30
days at room temperature.  [3303] Partially used vials of Rho(D)
immune globulin should be discarded.  [3313] The expiration date
for Rho(D)  immune globulin is not later than 6 months after the
date of issue from the manufacturer's cold storage, or not later
than  1  year from the date of manufacture,  as indicated on the
label.

  [3205]  Rho(D)  immune globulin suppresses the active antibody
response and formation  of  anti-Rho(D)   in  Rho(D)   negative,
Du-negative individuals exposed to Rh-positive blood. [3245] The
exact  mechanism  of  action  of  Rho(D)  immune globulin in the
suppression of formation of anti-Rho(D)   is  not  fully  known.
Anti-Rho(D)   antibody  contained in Rho(D)  immune globulin may
bind to Rho(D)  antigen that may enter  the  circulation  during
fetal-maternal  hemorrhage or transfusion accident,  and thereby
prevent stimulation of the primary immune response to the Rho(D)
and subsequent active production of anti-Rho(D).
  TEXT:
  [3203]  Exposure   to   Rh-positive   blood   may   occur   in
Rho(D)-negative, Du-negative women as a result of delivery of an
Rho(D)-positive or Du-positive infant,  termination of pregnancy
(i.e., abortion, miscarriage),  amniocentesis or other abdominal
trauma during pregnancy,  or transfusion with Rho(D)-positive or
Du-positive blood.
  [3203] The risk of an active antibody response  and  formation
of   anti-Rho(D)   following  exposure  of  an  Rho(D)-negative,
Du-negative individual to Rh-positive blood is directly  related
to  the  number  of  Rh-positive  red  blood  cells to which the
Rh-negative individual  is  exposed;   the  risk  of  an  active
antibody response is approximately 3% when 0.1 mL of Rh-positive
fetal  red blood cells are present in the mother and 65%  when 5
mL of Rh-positive fetal red blood cells are present. Exposure of
an Rho(D)-negative,  Du-negative mother to Rh-positive red blood
cells  occurs most frequently during delivery in the third stage
of  labor  when  fetal  red  blood  cells  enter  the   maternal
circulation.  However,  fetal-maternal hemorrhage has been noted
as early as the second trimester of pregnancy and  may  increase
in extent and frequency as gestation proceeds.

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3225]  Rho(D)  immune globulin is used to suppress the active
antibody  response  and  formation  of   anti-Rho(D)    in   the
Rho(D)-negative,   Du-negative individual exposed to Rh-positive
blood as a result of  the  delivery  of  an  Rho(D)-positive  or
Du-positive  infant,  termination of pregnancy (i.e.,  abortion,
miscarriage),  amniocentesis or other  abdominal  trauma  during
pregnancy,   or  transfusion with Rho(D)-positive or Du-positive
blood.
  Suppression   of   the   formation    of    anti-Rho(D)     in
Rho(D)-negative,   Du-negative  women  is  indicated  to prevent
hemolytic disease of the newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis)   if
there is a subsequent pregnancy with an Rho(D)-positive fetus.
  FULL-TERM DELIVERY
  [3225]  Rho(D)  immune globulin is used to suppress the active
antibody response to Rho(D)   in  Rho(D)-negative,   Du-negative
women  following  delivery  of an Rho(D)-positive or Du-positive
infant if the woman is not already sensitized to Rho(D).  If the
Rh  type  of  an infant born to an Rho(D)-negative,  Du-negative
mother cannot be determined,  the infant should be assumed to be
Rh-positive and Rho(D) immune globulin should be administered.
  TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY
  [3225]  Rho(D)  immune globulin is used to suppress the active
antibody response to Rho(D)   in  Rho(D)-negative,   Du-negative
women following termination of pregnancy. Rho(D) immune globulin
should  be  administered  after spontaneous or induced abortion,
miscarriage,  or ectopic pregnancy  in  previously  unsensitized
Rho(D)-negative,  Du-negative women unless the blood type of the
products of conception or the  father  is  shown  to  be  Rho(D)
negative,   Du  negative.   If the blood type of the products of
conception is not known,  it should  be  assumed  to  be  Rho(D)
positive and Rho(D) immune globulin should be administered.
  Rho(D)   immune  globulin  (microdose)   is  indicated  if the
pregnancy has been terminated up to 13 weeks of gestation,   and
Rho(D)   immune  globulin (standard dose)  is indicated when the
pregnancy has been terminated at 13 or more weeks of  gestation.
(See Dosage and Administration: Dosage.)
  OTHER OBSTETRICAL USES
  [3225]  Because amniocentesis or other abdominal trauma during
pregnancy may  result  in  fetal  cells  entering  the  maternal
circulation,   administration  of  Rho(D)   immune  globulin  is
generally recommended in Rho(D)-negative,  Du-negative  pregnant
women who undergo amniocentesis or other abdominal trauma.
  TRANSFUSION ACCIDENT
  [3225]  Rho(D)   immune globulin may be used to prevent active
antibody  response  and  formation  of  anti-Rho(D)    following
transfusion  of  Rho(D)-positive  or  Du-positive blood or blood
components such  as  platelets  or  granulocytes  prepared  from
Rh-positive blood to Rho(D)-negative,  Du-negative premenopausal
women.
  TEXT:
  [3223,3640] Passively  acquired  anti-Rho(D)   antibodies  are
usually undetectable 6 months following administration of Rho(D)
immune  globulin;   therefore,  administration of Rho(D)  immune
globulin following one pregnancy or  transfusion  accident  does
not  suppress  formation  of anti-Rho(D)  following a subsequent
exposure to Rh-positive blood.
  FULL-TERM DELIVERY
  [3223] Clinical studies  have  shown  that  administration  of
Rho(D)   immune  globulin  within  72  hours after delivery of a
full-term infant reduces the incidence of development of  active
antibody  response and formation of anti-Rho(D)  from 12-13%  to
1-2%.  The reduction in active antibody response  is  less  when
Rho(D) immune globulin is administered later than 72 hours after
delivery;    therefore,    Rho(D)   immune  globulin  should  be
administered within 72 hours after delivery.  In one study,  the
development   of  active  antibody  response  and  formation  of
anti-Rho(D)  was less than  0.1%   following  administration  of
Rho(D)  immune globulin in 2 doses,  the first dose administered
at 28 weeks  of  gestation  and  the  second  dose  administered
following delivery.
  TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY
  [3223] Clinical studies have shown that Rho(D) immune globulin
(microdose)   is  effective  when administered within 3 hours of
abortion; however,  administration of the drug more than 3 hours
after  termination  of  pregnancy may still be effective,  since
Rho(D) immune globulin (microdose)  was effective in suppressing
formation of anti-Rho(D) in male volunteers when administered up
to 72 hours after infusion of Rho(D)-positive blood.

  ADVERSE EFFECTS
  [3605]  Adverse  reactions  to  Rho(D)   immune  globulin  are
infrequent, mild, and usually confined to the site of injection.
Slight temperature elevations may occur.   [3605,3623]  Systemic
reactions  and  sensitization  due  to repeated injections occur
rarely.  [3605] Fever,  myalgia,  lethargy,  splenomegaly,   and
elevated bilirubin concentrations have occurred rarely following
transfusion  accidents  when  multiple  doses  of Rho(D)  immune
globulin were administered.
  The possibility  of  transmission  of  hepatitis  from  Rho(D)
immune  globulin is remote,  since plasma used in preparation of
the drug is tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
  PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
  [3645]  Rho(D)   immune   globulin   is   contraindicated   in
Rho(D)-positive     or    Du-positive    individuals    or    in
Rho(D)-negative,   Du-negative   individuals   who   have   been
previously sensitized to Rho(D) or Du antigens,  as evidenced by
the presence of anti-Rho(D) in their serum.
  Prior to administration of Rho(D) immune globulin, appropriate
laboratory tests capable of checking an individual's  serum  for
anti-Rho(D)  and sensitivity to the Rho(D)  blood factor must be
performed.  If the individual is found to be Rho(D)  positive or
Du positive, Rho(D)  immune globulin should not be administered.
A   large   fetal   bleed   into   the   maternal   circulation,
administration of Rho(D) immune globulin prior to delivery, or a
transfusion accident may affect interpretation of the tests.
  PREGNANCY
  [3643,3655]  Administration  of Rho(D)  immune globulin during
pregnancy appears to  have  no  adverse  effect  on  the  fetus;
however,   infants  born  to  women who were administered Rho(D)
immune globulin prior to delivery may  show  a  weakly  positive
direct antiglobulin (Coombs') test.

  ADMINISTRATION
  [3575] Rho(D) immune globulin is administered by IM injection.
[3575,3640]  Rho(D)   immune globulin should not be administered
IV.  Rho(D)  immune globulin is administered to the  mother  and
should not be administered to the infant.
  Appropriate  laboratory  tests  must  be  performed  prior  to
administration of Rho(D)  immune globulin  to  ensure  that  the
mother   is   Rho(D)-negative,    Du-negative.   (See  Cautions:
Precautions and Contraindications.)  [3575] The entire dosage of
Rho(D)   immune globulin may be administered in divided doses at
different sites;  the injections may be made at one time  or  at
intervals,   as long as the entire dosage is administered within
72 hours after delivery or termination of pregnancy.
  IM injections with Rho(D)  immune globulin should be made into
the deltoid muscle.
  DOSAGE
  [3585]  Each  vial  of Rho(D)  immune globulin (standard dose)
contains  enough  anti-Rho(D)   to  suppress  the   immunization
potential  of 15 mL of Rho(D)-positive or Du-positive packed red
blood cells.  Each vial of Rho(D)  immune  globulin  (microdose)
contains   enough  anti-Rho(D)   to  suppress  the  immunization
potential of 2.5 mL of Rho(D)-positive or Du-positive packed red
blood cells or the equivalent (5 mL) of whole blood in males.
  DOSAGE [3526] Full-Term Delivery
  [3525] The usual dose following delivery of a full-term infant
is 1 vial of Rho(D) immune globulin (standard dose) administered
within 72 hours  after  delivery.   If  a  large  fetal-maternal
hemorrhage is suspected (greater than 30 mL of whole blood or 15
mL of packed red blood cells),  an approved laboratory procedure
(e.g.,  modified Kleihauer-Betke technique)  should be performed
to  estimate  the number of fetal Rh-positive red blood cells in
the maternal circulation and to calculate the packed  red  blood
cell  volume  of  the  fetal-maternal hemorrhage.  The number of
vials  of  Rho(D)   immune  globulin  (standard  dose)   to   be
administered  can  then be determined by dividing the packed red
blood cell volume of the fetal-maternal hemorrhage by 15; if the
calculated dose results in a fraction of a vial,  the next whole
number of vials should be administered.
  If  Rho(D)  immune globulin is indicated prior to delivery,  1
vial of Rho(D)   immune  globulin  (standard  dose)   should  be
administered at approximately 28 weeks of gestation and a second
vial should be administered within 72 hours after delivery.
  DOSAGE [3526] Termination of Pregnancy
  [3525] After spontaneous or induced abortion, miscarriage,  or
ectopic pregnancy occurring up to 13 weeks  of  gestation,   the
usual  dose  is  1  vial  of Rho(D)  immune globulin (microdose)
administered within 72 hours.
  After spontaneous or induced abortion, miscarriage, or ectopic
pregnancy occurring at 13 or more weeks of gestation,  the usual
dose  is  1  vial  of  Rho(D)   immune  globulin (standard dose)
administered within 72 hours.
  DOSAGE [3526] Other Obstetrical Uses
  [3525]   Dosage   of   Rho(D)    immune   globulin   following
amniocentesis  or other abdominal trauma during pregnancy varies
and  should  be  based  on  an  estimate  of   the   extent   of
fetal-maternal  hemorrhage.  (See Full-Term Delivery,  in Dosage
and Administration: Dosage.)
  DOSAGE [3526] Transfusion Accident
  [3525]  Following  a  transfusion  accident,   the  volume  of
Rh-positive  whole  blood  accidentally  administered  should be
multiplied by the hematocrit of the donor unit of blood to  give
the volume of Rh-positive packed red blood cells transfused. The
number of vials of Rho(D) immune globulin (standard dose)  to be
administered is determined by dividing the volume of Rh-positive
packed red cells transfused  by  15;   if  the  calculated  dose
results in a fraction of a vial,  the next whole number of vials
should be administered.
  TEXT:
  ADMINISTRATION
  [3573] The plunger of the syringe should be drawn back  before
injection to ensure that the needle is not in a blood vessel. If
blood  or  any  unusual discoloration is present in the syringe,
the needle should be withdrawn and the syringe discarded.  A new
dose of Rho(D)  immune globulin should then be administered at a
different site using a new syringe and needle.

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3205] Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative with  potent
antihistaminic   properties   and  shares  the  actions  of  the
antihistamines.
  [3205] Promethazine also has antiemetic, anticholinergic,  and
local  anesthetic  effects.   [3245]  In  contrast to most other
phenothiazines,  promethazine also has  an  antimotion  sickness
action, possibly as a result of a central anticholinergic effect
on  the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center
and medullary chemoreceptive trigger zone of the midbrain.
  TEXT:
  [3203] Although the drug can produce either CNS stimulation or
CNS depression,  CNS depression manifested by sedation  is  more
common  with  therapeutic  doses  of  promethazine.   [3243] The
precise mechanism of the CNS effects of the drug is  not  known.
[3243]  Although  it  has been reported that the drug has slight
antitussive activity,  this may result from its  anticholinergic
and  CNS  depressant  effects.   [3203]  In  therapeutic  doses,
promethazine has no significant  effect  on  the  cardiovascular
system.    [3203,3570]   Although  rapid  IV  administration  of
promethazine may produce a transient  fall  in  blood  pressure,
blood  pressure  is usually maintained or slightly elevated when
the drug is given slowly.
  [3203,3253]  Promethazine  has  been   reported   to   inhibit
collagen-induced  neonatal  platelet  aggregation  in  vitro and
collagen-induced platelet aggregation in neonates whose  mothers
had received the drug during labor;(101)  however,  the clinical
importance of this effect is not known.(101)   Promethazine  has
also  been  reported  to  possibly  ameliorate  the  effects  of
hemolytic disease of the newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis) when
administered during pregnancy in  Rh-sensitized  women.(102-105)
[3243,3253] The exact mechanism(s) has not been elucidated,  but
several  mechanisms  may  be  involved.(102,105-112)   In  vitro
studies indicate that promethazine inhibits the ability of fetal
macrophages to bind Rh-positive erythrocytes;(106,107)  inhibits
phagocytosis  and  hexose  monophosphate   shunt   activity   in
polymorphonuclear  leukocytes;(108)   inhibits  lysis  of  fetal
Rh-positive   erythrocytes   mediated   by    lymphocytes    and
polymorphonuclear    leukocytes;(109)     and   stabilizes   the
erythrocyte membrane against hemolysis.(109)   Promethazine  has
also   been   shown   to   have  immunosuppressive  activity  in
animals.(102,110)  [3203,3253] Although some data suggested that
the  drug  may  reduce  the number and function of fetal T cells
when administered chronically during pregnancy,(111)  other data
indicate  that the drug does not affect the number of fetal T or
B cells;(112)  further  studies  on  the  potential  effects  of
promethazine on fetal immunocompetence are needed.(111,112)

  [3225] Promethazine shares  the  uses  of  the  antihistaminic
drugs.   [3225,3900]  (See  Uses  in  the Antihistamines General
Statement   4:00.)    [3225]   In   contrast   to   most   other
phenothiazines,   promethazine is effective in the management of
motion sickness.
  [3225,3900] For the use of  promethazine  as  a  sedative  and
antiemetic,   see Promethazine Hydrochloride 28:24.92.  See also
the Phenothiazines General Statement 28:16.08.
  TEXT:
  [3223,3600] Promethazine's pronounced sedative  effect  limits
the   usefulness  of  the  drug  as  an  antihistamine  in  many
ambulatory patients.
  [3213,3253,3650] Although  not  clearly  established,(102-104)
promethazine  has  been  reported  to  possibly  ameliorate  the
effects of hemolytic disease of the newborn+   (erythroblastosis
fetalis)   when  administered  during pregnancy in Rh-sensitized
women;(102-105)  therapy with the drug has reportedly  decreased
perinatal  mortality and the need for,  and number of,  neonatal
exchange   transfusions.(105)    Management   of   Rh-sensitized
pregnancies depends on the severity of disease in the fetus, and
preferred  methods of management include the use of intrauterine
fetal  erythrocyte  transfusions  and/or   early   delivery   as
necessary.(113,114)   Although further studies are needed,  some
clinicians suggest that use of promethazine may  be  beneficial,
particularly in cases of severe Rh sensitization.(104,105)

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  ADVERSE EFFECTS
  [3605] The most common adverse reactions of  promethazine  are
pronounced  sedative  effects  and  confusion or disorientation.
Adverse anticholinergic effects of the drug include  dryness  of
mouth, blurring of vision and, rarely, dizziness. Extrapyramidal
reactions  may  occur  with  high doses and usually subside with
dosage reduction.(117)   Lassitude,   fatigue,   incoordination,
tinnitus,  diplopia,  oculogyric crises,  insomnia,  excitation,
nervousness,  euphoria,   hysteria,   tremors,   seizures,   and
catatonic-like  states  have  been reported.(117)  Restlessness,
akathisia, and, occasionally,  marked irregular respiration have
occurred.   [3605,3570]  Patients  with  pain  who have received
inadequate  or  no  analgesia   have   developed   athetoid-like
movements   of   the   upper  extremities  following  parenteral
administration of promethazine.
  [3605]  Leukopenia  and  agranulocytosis  have  been  reported
rarely  in  patients  receiving promethazine in conjunction with
other   agents   known   to   have   caused    these    effects.
Thrombocytopenic    purpura    has    been    associated    with
promethazine.(117)
  [3605,3570] Tachycardia, bradycardia,  and faintness have been
reported  with  parenteral promethazine.(117)  Although rapid IV
administration of promethazine may produce a transient  fall  in
blood pressure, blood pressure is usually maintained or slightly
elevated when the drug is given slowly. Venous thrombosis at the
injection site has also been reported.(117)
  [3605]  Promethazine  has  been  associated  with  obstructive
jaundice,  which was usually reversible following discontinuance
of  the  drug.(117)   [3643,3623,3605] Photosensitivity has been
reported and may be a contraindication to  further  promethazine
therapy.   [3605,3623]  Urticaria,   dermatitis,   asthma,   and
angioedema have also been reported.(117) [3605] Nasal stuffiness
may also occur.(117)
  [3643,3570,3605] Chemical irritation and necrotic lesions have
resulted on rare occasions following subcutaneous  injection  of
promethazine  and  the  drug  should not be administered by this
route.  [3645,3570] When promethazine is given IV,  extreme care
should  be  exercised  to  avoid  extravasation  or  inadvertent
intra-arterial injection.  Promethazine hydrochloride should not
be  administered  intra-arterially,  because chemical irritation
may be severe and cause severe arteriospasm,  possibly resulting
in  impairment of circulation and gangrene requiring amputation.
Since promethazine discolors blood on  contact,   aspiration  of
dark  blood  at  the  site  of  injection  does not rule out the
possibility of intra-arterial placement of the needle.(117)   If
the  patient  complains  of  pain  at  the injection site during
presumed  IV  injection  of  the  drug,   the  injection  should
immediately  be  stopped  and  the possibility of intra-arterial
placement of the needle or perivascular extravasation should  be
evaluated.
  [3645,3623,3603] Although the risk of adverse reactions (e.g.,
blood  dyscrasias,   hepatotoxicity,   reactivation of psychotic
processes, tachycardia, cardiac arrest,  endocrine disturbances,
dermatologic  disorders,   ocular changes,  and hypersensitivity
reactions)  which have occurred during long-term  administration
of  antipsychotic  phenothiazines  appears  to  be minimal,  the
possibility that they could occur with prolonged  administration
of promethazine should be kept in mind.
  PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
  [3645]  Ambulatory patients should be warned that promethazine
may impair their ability to perform  hazardous  tasks  requiring
mental  alertness  or  physical  coordination  such as operating
machinery or driving a motor vehicle.  It should be kept in mind
that  the antiemetic effect of promethazine may obscure signs of
overdosage of other drugs or of symptoms of such  conditions  as
intestinal  obstruction  or  brain tumor,  and thereby interfere
with diagnosis.
  Promethazine should be used  with  caution  in  patients  with
cardiovascular  disease  or  impaired  liver function or who are
having an asthmatic attack.  Some manufacturers state  that  the
drug should be used cautiously in individuals with peptic ulcer.
[3645,3250]  Some  manufacturers  also  state the drug should be
used with caution in patients with acute or chronic  respiratory
impairment, particularly children,  because the cough reflex may
be suppressed.  Promethazine should be used with caution,  if at
all,   in  patients  with a history of sleep apnea.(100,119,124)
(See Cautions: Pediatric Precautions.)
  [3645,3623] Promethazine is contraindicated  in  patients  who
have  exhibited  hypersensitivity  to the drug.  [3645,3770] The
drug is also contraindicated in patients who have received large
doses of other CNS depressants and/or who are comatose.   [3645]
There  is  some  evidence that epileptic patients may experience
increased severity of seizures if treated with promethazine, and
the drug  may  be  contraindicated  in  these  patients.   Since
increases  in  blood pressure may occur,  promethazine should be
administered with extreme caution,  if at all,  to  patients  in
hypertensive crisis.  Some manufacturers state that promethazine
is also contraindicated in patients with bone marrow depression,
angle-closure glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy,  stenosing peptic
ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, or bladder neck obstruction.
  PEDIATRIC PRECAUTIONS
  [3645,3253]  Children receiving promethazine should be closely
supervised while performing hazardous activities  such  as  bike
riding.   Like other antihistamines,  promethazine should not be
used in premature or full-term neonates.   (See  Cautions:   CNS
Effects  and Pediatric Precautions in the Antihistamines General
Statement 4:00.)  [3645,3253] The drug should  not  be  used  in
acutely  ill  or  dehydrated  children  or  children  with acute
infections,    since   these   patients   have   an    increased
susceptibility to dystonias.  Use of promethazine should also be
avoided in children with signs and symptoms that suggest  Reye's
syndrome, since the potential extrapyramidal effects produced by
the  drug  may  obscure the diagnosis of or be confused with the
CNS signs and symptoms of this condition,  and in children  with
signs and symptoms of other hepatic disease.(117)
  [3645,3253]  Promethazine  should  be  used  with  caution  in
children with a history of sleep apnea,   those  with  a  family
history  of  SIDS,   and  those who are less prone than usual to
spontaneous arousal from sleep.(100,123,124)
  PREGNANCY, FERTILITY, AND LACTATION
  [3655,3643] Safe use of promethazine during pregnancy  (except
during labor)  with respect to possible adverse effects on fetal
development has not been established.  [3655,3643]  Promethazine
should be used during pregnancy only when the potential benefits
justify the possible risks to the fetus.
  [3645,3870]   Since   it  is  not  known  if  promethazine  is
distributed into milk,  the drug should be used with caution  in
nursing women.
  TEXT:
  ADVERSE EFFECTS
  [3603]  These  symptoms  usually disappeared when the pain was
controlled.
  [3683,3570] Although there are no proven successful  treatment
regimens  for  the  management  of  extravasation or inadvertent
intra-arterial injection of promethazine,  sympathetic block and
administration of heparin are commonly employed during the acute
management.(117)
  PEDIATRIC PRECAUTIONS
  [3643,3253,3003]   Although   the  relationship  and  possible
mechanism(s)  have not  been  elucidated,(119-123)   respiratory
depression, sleep apnea, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
have occurred in a number of infants and young children who were
receiving    usual    dosages   of   promethazine(119,123)    or
trimeprazine.(118,119,122) In one study,  the number but not the
duration  of  central  apneas  during  sleep  was  increased and
obstructive apnea during sleep (accompanied by  decreased  heart
rate  and  arterial  oxygen  pressure)   developed  in 4 healthy
infants who were receiving 1 mg/kg of promethazine hydrochloride
daily for 3 days.(123)
  MUTAGENICITY AND CARCINOGENICITY
  [3663] Long-term animal studies to determine the  carcinogenic
potential  of promethazine have not been performed to date.(100)
There was no evidence of promethazine-induced mutagenesis in the
Ames microbial mutagen test.(100)  There are no human  or  other
animal  data concerning the carcinogenic or mutagenic potentials
of the  drug.(100)   [3663,3643,3900]  For  information  on  the
carcinogenic   potential   of   phenothiazines,   see  Cautions:
Carcinogenicity  in   the   Phenothiazines   General   Statement
28:16.08.
  PREGNANCY, FERTILITY, AND LACTATION
  [3653]  Although  there are no adequate and controlled studies
to date in humans,   promethazine  has  not  been  shown  to  be
teratogenic  in  rats  receiving oral dosages of 6.25-12.5 mg/kg
daily   (about   6-16.7   times   the   usual   human   dosage).
Antihistamines,  including promethazine,  have been fetocidal in
rodents,  but the pharmacologic effects of histamine in  rodents
differ  from those in humans.  [3653,3643,3210] Promethazine has
been reported to possibly ameliorate the  effects  of  hemolytic
disease   of  the  newborn+   (erythroblastosis  fetalis)   when
administered during pregnancy in  Rh-sensitized  women,(102-105)
but  the  safety  and efficacy of the drug for this use have not
been clearly established;(102-104)  other methods of  management
are preferred.(113,114)
  [3613] There are no animal or human data concerning the effect
of promethazine on fertility.(100)

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  ADMINISTRATION
  [3575] Promethazine hydrochloride may be  administered  orally
or rectally, or by IV or deep IM injection. [3575,3640] The drug
should  not  be  given subcutaneously or intra-arterially.  (For
precautions associated with  IV  injection  of  the  drug,   see
Cautions:    Adverse   Effects.)    [3575,3523,3640,3430]   When
promethazine hydrochloride is administered IV,  the drug  should
preferably  be  administered  through  the  tubing  of  a freely
flowing IV infusion set,  the rate of administration should  not
exceed  25  mg/minute,   and  the concentration of the injection
should not exceed 25 mg/mL.
  DOSAGE
  [3585,3573]  Dosages  of  promethazine  hydrochloride  by  the
various routes of administration are identical.
  DOSAGE [3526] Allergic Conditions
  [3575]  As an antihistamine,  promethazine is usually given at
bedtime because of its pronounced sedative effects.  [3525]  The
usual  adult  oral dose is 25 mg before retiring;  if necessary,
however,  12.5 mg  may  be  administered  before  meals  and  on
retiring.   [3555] Children may receive a single bedtime dose of
up to 25 mg or up to 12.5 mg 3 times daily depending on the  age
and  weight of the child.  Alternatively,  children may be given
0.5 mg/kg at bedtime or  0.125  mg/kg  as  needed.   [3525,3553]
Dosage  should  be  adjusted  to the smallest amount adequate to
relieve symptoms.
  When the oral route is not  feasible,   25  mg  may  be  given
rectally, IM, or IV. This dose may be repeated within 2 hours if
necessary,   but  oral  therapy  should be instituted as soon as
possible if further medication is necessary.
  [3525]  To  prevent  or  control  minor  allergic  transfusion
reactions in adults,  25 mg of promethazine hydrochloride may be
administered prior to or during a blood transfusion.
  DOSAGE [3526] Motion Sickness
  [3525,3553] For the management of motion sickness,  adults may
be  given  25  mg of promethazine hydrochloride and children may
receive 12.5-25 mg or 0.5 mg/kg. [3573,3525,3553] The first dose
should be given at least 30-60 minutes prior  to  departure.   A
second  dose  may  be  given  8-12  hours  later  if  necessary.
Additional doses may be given on  arising  in  the  morning  and
before the evening meal for the duration of the journey.
  TEXT:
  DOSAGE [3526] Other Uses
  [3210,3523,3650]  When used to possibly ameliorate the effects
of hemolytic disease of the newborn+  (erythroblastosis fetalis)
in Rh-sensitized pregnant women,  promethazine hydrochloride has
been administered orally,  usually  beginning  after  the  first
trimester  or  the 16th week of gestation.(102-105)  The initial
dosage of the drug and subsequent dosage adjustments  depend  on
the    woman's    obstetric   history   and   severity   of   Rh
sensitization;(105)    clinicians   should   consult   published
protocols  for  specific dosage information.(105)  The suggested
initial dosage ranges from 3.7-5  mg/kg  daily,   given  to  the
nearest 25-mg multiple and in 4 divided doses.(105) In extremely
severe cases,  maintenance dosage as high as 6.5 mg/kg daily has
been used.(105)

  Rho(D) immune globulin (anti-D immunoglobulin; Rhesonativ;  I)
was  given  IM  to  15  Rh  negative  women  in the 28th week of
gestation  and  to  3  nonpregnant  women,   to  determine   the
biological  half-life  following  125 mug and 250 mug of I.  The
doses were 125 mug in 8 and 250 mug in 7 of  the  women.   Three
nonpregnant  Rh negative women were given the smaller dose.  The
recovery in vivo of I was on the average 24%  in the nonpregnant
women and 21% in the pregnant women. The half-lives of I were 24
and 21 days,  respectively.  With a dose of 125 mug,  the plasma
anti-D concentration was less than one ng/ml at about  10  weeks
after the injection. With double the dose,  the concentration at
delivery was at least one ng/ml. Although 250 mug of I seemed to
be effective when given in the 28th week of gestation, the great
individual variations in uptake and recovery rates will lead  to
occasional cases of Rh-immunization during pregnancy despite all
routine regimens.

symptoms of the disease. Only in 22 cases could typical symptoms
of  hepatitis  with  an  average  incubation  time of 55 days be
observed.  Thirty-two patients showed signs of cholestasis,  and
evidence of hepatitis C was found in 21 cases. A high percentage
(43%) of chronic cases was observed after a period of one yr.

  Case for the antenatal administration of anti-D immunoglobulin

  An analysis of data collected in the Yorkshire region from all
Rh-negative mothers points to  the  value  of  at  least  giving
anti-D immunoglobulin Rho(D)  immune globulin;  I antenatally to
all Rh-negative primigravidae and,  if the baby is found  to  be
Rh-negative, administering I antenatally in the second pregnancy
and  this should enable all Rh-negative mothers to have at least
3  live  children.   Blood  samples  from  almost  all  pregnant
Rh-negative women in the region were collected and tested for Rh
antibodies with standard techniques, including enzyme assays and
all  Rh-negative  mothers  bearing an Rh-positive child received
100 mug of I  post-natally,   unless  the  Kleihauer  count  was
abnormally  high,   in  which  case  a  larger  dose  was given.
Rh-negative mothers having abortions  received  50  mug  if  the
abortion  occurred  before  20  weeks  and  100 mug if later.  A
further advantage of a primigravida  antenatal  program  is  the
likelihood  of  reducing  failures of administration,  since the
injections will be part of the routine antenatal care.

  A survey was conducted on 264  Rh-negative  expectant  mothers
who had Rh antibodies for the first time to determine the effect
of   an   antenatal   injection   of   250-300   mug  of  anti-D
immunoglobulin (Rho(D)   immune  globulin;   I)   in  preventing
sensitization  and  decreasing  the  incidence  and  severity of
hemolytic disease of the newborn.  Results showed that in  about
50% of the mothers, the injection of I after the delivery of the
previous  Rh-positive  baby  might have prevented sensitization,
and the administration of I antenatally during  pregnancy  could
have prevented sensitization in the other mothers.  Results also
showed that only one in 9 babies born to  the  mothers  given  I
required  transfusion  as  compared with one in 5 when I was not
given.

  In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Rh hemolytic disease
prevention in the United States from 1968 to 1975, the incidence
of Rh hemolytic disease and associated infant mortality, and the
extent of Rho(D)  immune human globulin (I)  use  at  the  local
hospital-clinic   and  state  level  were  studied.   Nationwide
surveillance of Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn showed  that
associated infant mortality decreased from 941 deaths in 1968 to
269  deaths in 1975,  or from 2.7 to 0.9 per 10,000 live births.
The incidence of Rh  hemolytic  disease  declined  from  45  per
10,000  total births in 1970 to 21 per 10,000 in 1975.  In 1970,
an estimated 16,000 infants were affected, whereas in 1975,  the
number  was  6,000.  Several state based Rh disease surveillance
programs  reported  declining  mortality   and   incidence   and
increasing use of I.  I was administered to an estimated 80%  of
eligible Rh negative women in 1974,  81%  in 1975,  and 82%   in
1976.   More  concerted  efforts  are  needed  to  determine the
frequency of maternal sensitization and to identify and  correct
gaps in postpartum and postabortion use of I.

by administration of anti-D immunoglubulin (I;   Rho(D)   immune

abortion. Between 1970 and 1976,  the incidence of Rh antibodies
in  Rh  negative  pregnant  women  fell  by  70%.  This decrease
occurred in both old and new cases,  which emphasizes  the  fact
that   the  reduction  in  number  was  as  much  due  to  fewer

  In a double blind trial, Rho(D) human immune globulin (Gamulin
Rh;   I)   in doses of 499,  155,  or 73 mcg IM was administered
postpartum to 187 Rh-negative women  undergoing  elective  first
trimester  abortion.   Results are reported for the 134 patients
(71.6%)  who completed the follow-up period of 4  to  6  months.
Both  the  499  and  the  155  mcg doses appeared to offer total
protection against maternal Rh-sensitization,  with the possible
exception of one patient receiving the lower dose. The number of
patients  receiving  73  mcg  of  I  was  too  small  to analyze
statistically. In the follow-up testing, the percent of positive
(passive)  titers and the absolute level of detectable  antibody
were related to the dose of I administered. The results indicate
that  lower  than  usual  doses  of I may be protective in early
abortions where fetal blood volume and leakage into the maternal
circulation is relatively small.

  In  a controlled trial,  vials containing 200,  100,  50 or 20
mcg.  of anti-D immunoglobulin (I)  were given to  nearly  2,000
D-negative   primiparae   whose   infants  were  D-positive  and
ABO-compatible.  Only mothers whose  serum  lacked  anti-D  were
included  and  the dose of I was always given within 36 hours of
delivery.   Each  vial  contained  the  same  total  volume   of
immunoglobulin  and the particular dose given to any patient was
not known to the  clinician.   The  content  of  the  vials  was
estimated  3  times during the course of the trials and remained
fairly constant.  Six months after delivery,  the incidence of a
positive  indirect  antiglobulin  test  result,   indicating the
presence of anti-D, in the 4 dose groups was as follows:  0.22%,
0.23%,   0.44%  and 1.34%.  The trend towards an increase in the
frequency of failures as the dose decreases was  significant  at
the level of P =  0.02.  In each dose group about 200 women were
followed to the end of a  second  pregnancy  with  a  D-positive
infant.   The  failure rates (in order of decreasing dosage)  as
judged by a positive indirect antiglobulin test  result  at  the
second delivery were as follows: 1.5%, 1.1%, 1.5% and 2.9%.  The
differences between  the  dose  groups  were  not  statistically
significant. The overall failure rate (1.7%) was about one-tenth
of  that  expected  in  an untreated series.  Though the results
failed to prove any differences in success rates  between  doses
of 200, 100, 50 and 20 mcg. of I, they do suggest, in conformity
with  other evidence,  that a dose of 20 mcg.  is suboptimal for
routine use. These results support the belief that a dose of 100
mcg. is adequate.

  Protection from immunization after Rh incompatible pregnancies

  A  general  discussion  on  RhoGAM  [Rho(D)   immune  globulin
(human)],  its clinical uses,  failures and contraindications is
presented.   RhoGAM  is  immune  globulin  G  (IgG)   containing
anti-Rho(D)  antibody,  and  is  for  administration  to  Rho(D)
negative  or  Du negative postpartum patients after the birth of
an Rho(D)  positive or Du positive baby,  or after a miscarriage
with a Rho(D) positive father.  This prevents isoimmunization in
the mother from fetal erythrocytes entering the  maternal  blood
and  causing erythroblastotic infants in subsequent pregnancies.
Failures of this drug have been ascribed to administration after
immunization  occurred  or  to  an  insufficient  dose.   It  is
contraindicated in those already immunized, in patients prior to
delivery and in Rho(D) positive or Du positive patients or those
having received a transfusion of this type.  Reactions are mild,
infrequent and usually confined to the  intramuscular  injection
site.   Results  of clinical studies of RhoGAM in 1,199 patients
are summarized.

  To determine if a relationship exists between the incidence of
neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and the total dose  of  dinoprostone
(I)  used to effect delivery,  a prospective study of 447 labors
and the resulting newborn was performed.  There were 243  labors
of spontaneous onset,  of which 55 required acceleration with I,
average dose 0.4 mg.  There were 204 patients in which labor was
induced  by  IV dinoprostone and simultaneous amniotomy (average
dose  0.61  mg).   It  was  found  that   the   mean   bilirubin
concentration  of babies born after induced or accelerated labor
was not significantly  greater  than  that  in  the  spontaneous
labors and deliveries.  There was also no significant difference
in the mean total dose of I received by mothers  of  babies  who
developed  hyperbilirubinemia  and  those  who did not.  This is
unlike the situation with oxytocin where an  increased  dose  is
associated  with  increased levels of bilirubin.  No association
was demonstrated between neonatal hyperbilirubinemia  and  birth
weight or duration of labor. In conclusion, it is suggested that
I  be  used  to induce labor in mothers whose babies are at risk
from developing hyperbilirubinemia because  of  prematurity  and
rhesus isoimmunization.

  A prospective study of 1353 labors was conducted to  determine
the  effects  of  oxytocin  (I)  on the subsequent occurrence of
hyperbilirubinemia in newborns. Labor was induced or accelerated
by I in  815  patients  and  538  were  spontaneous.   The  mean
bilirubin  concentration  of babies born after induced labor did
not differ significantly from the controls. However,  in induced
labor  situations,  mothers of normal babies received an average
of 9.91 u I compared to 18.77 u in mothers of hyperbilirubinemic
babies. The dosages in accelerated labors were 6.42 and 12.78 u,
respectively.  It was concluded that the use  of  I  in  mothers
whose  babies  run  the  risk  of  developing hyperbilirubinemia
because of Rh  isoimmunization  or  extreme  immaturity  is  not
suggested.

  One-third of  144  Rh-negative  unsensitized  gravidas  showed
fetal  erythrocytes  during  their third trimester of pregnancy.
This was also true of more than half of 155 such women one  hour
after delivery of the placenta. Although manipulative removal of
the   placenta  augments  the  occurrence  of  fetal-erythrocyte
transfer,  the number of such cells in the mother's  circulation
was  not  increased.   Ocytocin-induced labor markedly increases
transplacental passage of fetal  red  cells.   Early  postpartum
injection  of  Rh-immune  globulin  clears Rh-incompatible fetal
erythrocytes  from  the  maternal  blood  and  prevents  primary
isoimmunization.

  Failure  to  administer  additional  doses  of  Rh  immune globulin (RhIG) to
patients  with  excessive fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) is one of the causes of
continued  Rh  isoimmunization. We compared the fetal cell ratio (FCR) with the
other  laboratory methods currently used at our hospital to quantitate FMH, ie,
fetal  cell  preparation  (FCP),  RhIG  cross-match  with  maternal  serum, and
indirect  Coombs'  testing  24  to  48  hours after administration of RhIG. The
incidence  of  excessive  FMH  as  detected  by  the  various  methods was 3.6%
(cross-match),  9.6% (Coombs'), 18% (FCP), and 66% (FCR). The methods currently
used  do not accurately quantify FMH. The FCR is the most sensitive test but it
has  a  high  false-positive  rate  and  thus  does not appear to be clinically
useful.  We  suggest  that  repeating  the  indirect Coombs' test may provide a
practical alternative for determining the need for additional doses of RhIG.

  Current serologic tests occasionally fail to identify women needing more than
one  vial  of  Rh  immune  globulin. We compared the indirect antiglobulin test
after  incubation  with  anti-D  and a rosetting technique using enzyme treated
Rh2Rh2  erythrocytes  as  methods  for  identifying  significant fetal maternal
hemorrhage  (FMH).  Artificial  mixtures  containing  0.05 to 1.2 percent Rh1rh
(CcDe)  fetal  red  blood  cells  mixed with rh (ce) adult red blood cells were
tested.   The   indirect   antiglobulin   test   of  the  0.6  percent  mixture
(approximately  30 ml FMH) was reported to be microscopically positive by 17/20
technologists; whereas, 20/20 found the rosetting test to be strongly positive.
The  volume  of  FMH  in  118  postpartum  Rh  immune  globulin  candidates was
quantified using Kleihauer's test and formula. The results of the rosetting and
Kleihauer tests of blood specimens from these patients were negative 1.4 ml for
two,  and  strongly  positive  rosetting  test  and  FMH of 6.5 ml for one. The
rosetting  test  utilizes  routine  blood banking skills and requires 5 minutes
more  "hands  on"  time  than  an  indirect antiglobulin test. Confirmation and 
quantification of positive results by an acid-elution test is necessary.

  An   enzyme-linked  antiglobulin  test  has  been  developed  to  detect  and
quantitate  fetal-maternal  hemorrhage.  The  test  is applicable to postpartum
screening of Rh immune globulin candidates. The enzyme-linked antiglobulin test
has  greater  sensitivity than agglutination tests; it has fewer false positive
results  than  acid-elution  detection methods and offers advantages for use in
routine clinical laboratories. Postpartum samples from 186 mother were assessed
by the enzyme-linked antiglobulin test; only 20 samples (10.75%) has detectable
fetal  cells,  and  no  patient had bleeding of more than the limit of 30 ml of
whole blood for one vial of Rh immune globulin. No clinical or historic factors
could  predict  the patient at high risk for fetal-maternal hemorrhage. The use
of  the  enzyme-linked antiglobulin test also could permit the reduction of the
postnatal  Rh immune globulin dosage and salvage much of the Rh immune globulin
now administered.

  During a 5-year period, an enzyme-linked antiglobulin test was used to screen
and  quantitate fetal-maternal hemorrhage in 789 consecutive D-negative mothers
who  were  delivered  of  D-positive  babies.  Six hundred seventy-two patients
(85.2%)  had  no detectable fetal-maternal hemorrhage, and 117 patients (14.8%)
had  a  detectable  fetal-maternal  hemorrhage.  Eight  of  the  789 (1%) had a
fetal-maternal hemorrhage greater than 30 ml and required more than one vial of
Rh immune globulin. Two patients with fetal-maternal hemorrhage of 29 and 30 ml
also  received  additional  Rh  immune globulin. Each case was reviewed for the
presence of high-risk features that are thought to predict patients at risk for
fetal-maternal  hemorrhage.  Patients  having a cesarean section or complicated
vaginal   delivery  were  considered  to  be  in  a  group  at  high  risk  for
fetal-maternal hemorrhage, while those with a spontaneous vaginal delivery were
considered  not  to be at risk for fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Thirty-two of 237 
patients  (13.5%) in the risk group and 82 of 552 patients (15.3%) in the group
not  at  risk  had  detectable  fetal-maternal  hemorrhage.  The  incidence  of
fetal-maternal  hemorrhage for these two groups was not statistically different
(p greater than 0.50 by chi 2 analysis). If only patients in the risk group had
been screened for fetal-maternal hemorrhage, then five of 10 (50%) who required
more  than  one  vial of Rh immune globulin would have been undertreated and at
risk for developing anti-D antibodies. In addition, newborn birth weight, Apgar
scores, and hematocrits were examined for 13 cases of fetal-maternal hemorrhage
of  greater  than or equal to 21 ml, and none of these characteristics could be
used  to  predict patients at risk for fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Therefore, no
maternal  or  newborn  characteristics  could be identified that would reliably
predict  patients  at  risk for fetal-maternal hemorrhage. We conclude that all
D-negative  patients  with D-positive babies should continue to be screened for
fetal-maternal  hemorrhage  to  identify those patients requiring more than one
vial of Rh immune globulin.

  A case of massive feto-maternal haemorrhage which was discovered by chance in
the  34th  week of pregnancy is described in detail. This case is characterised
by: total absence of clinical, electrical and echographic abnormalities, a part
from  the fetus being very anaemic; the saving of the very anaemic newborn baby
because  of  the  performance of caesarean section; although the pregnant woman
was  Rh  negative,  giving  her  large doses of IgG and anti-D prophylactically
seems to have protected her from Rh immunisation. The authors conclude with the
special  value that they have found using the Kleihauer test. This is a simple,
reproducible,  low-cost  laboratory examination. They suggest that it should be
used mainly in the last third of pregnancy and may be even routinely.

  The   controversial   proposal   to  use  Rho  (D)  immune  globulin  (human)
prophylactically  in  pregnancy  should  not  detract  from  the most expedient
approach  to  further  reduction  of  Rh disease; that is, to ensure that every
eligible  woman  is  given  Rho  (D)  immune  globulin  (human) after delivery,
abortion,  or  ectopic  pregnancy. Family planning by Rh-negative women at risk
and  limiting  the  number  of  pregnancies  in women already immunized will be
additional  effective ways to reduce the current incidence of hemolytic disease
in  most  communities.  Present  evidence shows that blanket antepartum Rho (D)
immune  globulin  (human)  prophylactic  treatment will be very costly and will
place  many  subjects  at  potential risk while offering benefit to only a few.
Sensitive  and  practical  laboratory  testing  for  fetomaternal hemorrhage is
presently only a research tool but will soon be clinically available to provide
new  data  on fetomaternal hemorrhage. In the near future, pregnant women truly
at  risk  for  Rh isoimmunization may be identified by analysis of their blood,
and  this  will  be  a  rational  basis  for antepartum Rho (D) immune globulin 
(human) treatment. There are compelling advantages in cost, risks, and benefits
for an approach of selective antepartum Rho (D) immune globulin (human) therapy
as opposed to routine prophylaxis for all Rh-negative gravid women.

  A  1980 College of American Pathologists Immunohematology Survey included two
erythrocyte  suspensions,  one  with  and  one without fetal cells, designed to
evaluate  methods  for detecting and quantitating fetomaternal hemorrhage in Rh
immune  globulin  candidates. Data from a supplementary questionnaire regarding
Rh  immune  globulin  administration during 1979 were compared by methods used.
The  most  commonly used screening test was the microscopic Du. With this test,
12.2%  of  nearly  2,000  laboratories  obtained  a false negative result on an
unknown  which  contained  approximately 0.6% Rh positive erythrocytes. On this
100%  adult  cell  suspension  two-thirds  of  laboratories  using acid elution
technics  reported  the presence of fetal cells. Laboratories using Fetaldex to
screen for and quantitate fetomaternal hemorrhage had the highest rate of false
positives  on this unknown and reported higher rates of multiple vial Rh immune
globulin  administration when compared to institutions using other acid elution
procedures.  The  second  unknown  in  this survey contained approximately 0.4%
fetal  cells.  About one third of laboratories, using each of four acid elution 
technics,  reported  values  less than one half to more than twice this amount.
The number of false positive and false negative results and the wide scatter of
quantitation  amounts  reported  for  these  two  unknowns  suggest that better
methods are needed for screening and quantitating fetomaternal hemorrhage.

  In  a  series of 1206 consecutive Rh-negative women who delivered Rh-positive
infants,  fetal  erythrocytes  were  found in the maternal blood of 175 (14.5%)
during  the  postpartum  period.  In  12  (1.0%) there was evidence of a larger
fetomaternal  hamorrhage  than  would  be neutralized by a single 300-microgram
dose  of  Rh-immune  globulin.  Except  for  manual removal of the placenta, no
correlation  was  found  between  large  fetomaternal hemorrhages and obstetric
manipulations,  complications,  or  surgery. Thus, the authors believe that all
Rh-negative  patients  should be screened post partum to ascertain the adequacy
of Rh-immune globulin prophylaxis.

  The  possibility  of  Rh  immune  globulin failure exists when a fetomaternal
hemorrhage  exceeds 25 to 30 ml of whole blood and only one 300 micrograms vial
of  Rh  immune  globulin  is  administered.  In  this prospective study of 1000
consecutive  Rh-negative  women  who  were  delivered  of  Rh-positive  newborn
infants,  the  presence  of fetal erythrocytes in maternal blood was identified
with  use  of both the Du test read microscopically and the erythrocyte rosette
test.  All  positive tests prompted fetomaternal hemorrhage quantification with
use  of  a  modified  Kleihauer-Betke  acid  elution  test.  Nineteen  patients
demonstrated  a  positive  rosette test, and the only positive Du tests were in
five of these 19. Six of the nineteen had levels of greater than 30 ml of whole
blood  for  an  incidence  of  0.6%  for  fetomaternal hemorrhage exceeding the
protective   capabilities  of  the  standard  Rh  immune  globulin  dosage.  In
experiments  with simulated fetomaternal hemorrhage, all 79 samples, containing
from  2.5  to  70  ml  of  fetal  whole  blood,  were positive according to the
erythrocyte  rosette test. Applying the Du test to the same samples resulted in 
a  30%  false negative rate at the level of a 30 ml simulated hemorrhage. Based
on  sufficient  sensitivity,  ease  of interpretation, and reasonable cost, the
rosette test appears to be a superior screening test for excessive fetomaternal
hemorrhage in Rh immune globulin candidates.

  A  program to reduce the incidence of erythroblastosis fetalis was started in
Nova  Scotia  in  1964.  Up  to  the  end  of  1984,  120  fetuses received 247
intrauterine transfusions. The survival rate was 45.6% in the first 10 years of
the  program  and  66.7% in the next 11 years. For fetuses at or over 26 weeks'
gestation  the figures were 51.5% and 73.7% respectively. Postpartum prevention
was  started  in  1968,  with  administration  of  Rh immune globulin (RhIG) to
Rh-negative unimmunized women within 72 hours after the birth of an Rh-positive
infant.  Antepartum prevention, started in 1979, consisted of administration of
RhIG at 28 weeks' gestation to Rh-negative unimmunized women. The effectiveness
of the prevention program was evaluated by enumerating the known cases of Rh(D)
alloimmunization in the province from 1982 to 1984: 55 cases were identified, a
rate of 1.5 per 1000 births instead of the expected rate of about 10 per 1000.

  A  retrospective  review  of  obstetric records for 1979 in two major Calgary
hospitals was undertaken to determine the rate of compliance with postpartum Rh
isoimmunization prophylaxis in Alberta. The charts of 4528 women ranging in age
from  13  to  46  years were reviewed. The prevalence rate of Rh negativity was
found  to  be  16%.  Of  the  710  Rh-negative women 490 (69%) were eligible to
receive  Rh immune globulin (RhIG); that is, they had no anti-D antibodies, and
the  baby/fetus  was  Rh-positive  or Rh-unknown. RhIG had been administered to
93.6%  of  the  eligible  women;  the  compliance  rate  ranged  from 66.7% for
obstetric    emergencies    (i.e.,    spontaneous   abortion,   antepartum   or
early-pregnancy  hemorrhage,  or  ectopic  pregnancy)  to  98.2% for postpartum
diagnoses.  In  more than half (54.7%) of the women who underwent amniocentesis
Rh  type  was  not  determined; the implications of this finding are discussed.
Although  poor  compliance  with postpartum RhIG administration is not a reason
for  withholding antepartum administration of RhIG, maximum compliance with the
more  cost-effective programs should be attained before antepartum programs are
fully implemented.

  A  total  of  118 Rh isoimmunized pregnant women were discovered from 1972 to
1981. In diagnosing the disorder, the author draws attention to the examination
of bilirubin in the amnionic fluid as the most reliable indicator, to which the
dosing  of measurable antibodies and echography are, in his opinion, a precious
contribution. The administration of corticosteroids, antihistaminics, capillary
protectors,  and  sedatives proved unreliable. A premature delivery was induced
in  79  cases,  after  the  assessment of the fetus maturity. The pregnancy was
terminated  vaginally  in  60  and  by cesarean section in 19 cases. Twenty-two
near-term  children  ere delivered without major problems. Failure was recorded
in  31  (26.3%)  cases:  17  deaths  in  the  uterus  and 14 deaths of newborns
immediately   after   birth.   Out   of  87  surviving  children,  36  received
exsanguinotransfusion 1-4 times.

  42  cases of cerebral embolism in patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD)
are  reported  in this study; 25 received anticoagulation acutely. Admission CT
scans  were obtained within 24 hrs. of onset in 39; in 22 cases, CT was normal,
low  density  lesion was seen in 18 cases, and hemorrhagic infarction (HI) in 2
cases. Repeat CT demonstrated HI in 7 cases. Admission neurologic deficits were
similar  in  the pts. who developed HI compared to the group as a whole. Only 1
patient  had  recurrent  embolism;  3/7  pts.  who  developed  HI  were  not on
anticoagulation  therapy. 2/7 pts with HI died at the time of occurrence of HI;
they  were  both  on  anticoagulation.  Clearly,  HI  can occur with or without
anticoagulant   therapy.   The   authors   suggest   delaying   initiation   of
anticoagulation  for  3  days  after the acute embolic stroke in pts. with RHD.
