  Selected findings from a study of mothers of apneic infants who were enrolled
in  a  monitoring  program  are  presented.  Stresses  reported  by the mothers
included  the  need for constant watchfulness, feelings of confinement, lack of
personal time, and limited time with other children in the family.

  The  study  was  carried out to validate objectively the relationship between
clinical   impressions   of   parents  and  ECG  evidence  of  life-threatening
arrhythmias in infants considered to be at high risk. Twenty infants considered
to be at high risk were provided with a hospital grade home monitor with a hard
copy-recording  capability (n = 12) and/or an ECG telephone transmission system
(n  = 8). There were 93 alarms considered by the parents as true alarms. All of
the   ECG  tracings  recorded  during  the  93  episodes  were  normal.  Infant
stimulation  was  provided for 11 infants and was not administered during 82 of
these  alarms.  None of the infants died and all are well at 1 year of age. Our
data raises questions regarding parental clinical ability to correctly perceive
a  true  near  miss episode in most cases and may explain, in part, the lack of

  Theophylline and caffeine are two drugs frequently administered to infants at
risk  for sudden infant death syndrome, because of their stimulatory effects on
the  respiratory  system.  These  drugs  are  known  to  increase  gastric acid
secretion  and  to  decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure that, in turn,
possibly increases gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Thirty babies were tested for
GER  before and during caffeine treatment. Eighteen were studied under the same
conditions   while   undergoing  theophylline  treatment.  All  results  of  pH
monitoring  before  treatment  were  within  normal  ranges.  Episodes  of  GER
increased  significantly  (P  less than .001) in about 50% of the group treated
with  caffeine and in 66% of the group treated with theophylline. These results
were independent of plasma xanthine concentrations (within or below therapeutic

  Home  apnea/bradycardia  monitoring  is  frequently used in the management of
infants  at  increased  risk  for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However,
some  infants  have  died  despite evaluation by infant apnea programs, and the
benefits  of  home  monitoring  remain unproven. To determine the SIDS rate and
risk  factors  of infants evaluated by infant apnea programs, 31 apnea programs
and  ten  home monitor vendors in California were surveyed. Eleven (35%) of the
apnea  programs  and  four  (40%)  of  the  vendors  responded. Information was
obtained  on  26  infants  who  died.  Thirteen  (50%) deaths were due to SIDS.
Abnormal  sleep  studies  did not predict death. Fifteen infants died despite a
recommendation  for  home monitoring. Seven deaths occurred in association with

  A  new, inexpensive commercial infant respiration monitor, the Baby-Sitter by
Direct  Diagnostics  Ltd,  has  been evaluated and subjected to clinical trial.
Dual  respiration recordings were made from infants exhibiting apnoeic episodes
to  compare  the  new  monitor  with  an  acceptable reference monitor (Graesby
Medical  Model MR10). Both monitors are designed to detect respiration movement
by  means  of  pressure pulses produced in an air-filled sensor attached to the
infant's abdomen. The new monitor is found to have unacceptable performance.

  A  randomised  control  trial  was  carried  out on support measures given to
parents  with a subsequent child after previously suffering a cot death. Apnoea
monitors  were  used  in  one  group  and weighing scales in the other. General
support  measures  given  to both groups included the keeping of symptom charts
and  weekly visits by health visitors. Many alarms occurred which were presumed
to  be  false.  Eleven  per  cent  fewer  symptoms  were reported by parents of
children on monitors than parents of children being weighed daily. Both systems
were  acceptable  and  gave  parents confidence. Sixty per cent of parents were
reluctant  to  give  up  using  the  monitor compared with 26% of parents using
scales.  Virtually  all parents commented on the great value of the weekly home
visit of the health visitor and the symptom diary.

  Could supplementary dietary tryptophan prevent sudden infant death syndrome?

  Rapid  eye  movement (REM) sleep seems to protect infants from developing the
sudden  infant  death  syndrome (SIDS). A biological rhythm involving the locus
ceruleus  and  the  dorsal  raphe nucleus has been related to melatonin and REM
sleep.  The  same rhythm is present in the medial parabrachial nucleus which is
an  oscilator  for  pneumotaxic  activity.  Tryptophan  has  been  shown  to be
effective  in  some  adult  sleep  apneas and to increase REM sleep in infants.
Tryptophan  -  serotonin  -  melatonin deficiencies are suggested as a possible
cause of SIDS.

  Using  vertebral  artery  sonography,  we  investigated  the influence of the
position  of  the  head on the vertebral artery bloodflow in five children, who
were  admitted  because  of NSIDS (near sudden infant death syndrome) episodes.
Three  out  of  the  five  children  showed  blocking  of  vertebral  bloodflow
determined  by  position of the head. This was not observed in five age-matched
controls.  Our  preliminary  observations  indicate  the  value  of noninvasive
ultrasound  Doppler  techniques  in  the  diagnostic  work in the children with
NSIDS. In this way one of the risk factors for SIDS might be identified.

  Apnea  of  infancy  represents  a problem that is commonly encountered by the
practicing  pediatrician;  yet,  few  publications  have  outlined  a practical
approach  to  the care of such infants. In addition, the somewhat controversial
aspects  of  infant apnea and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have resulted
in  the  belief  on  the part of many physicians that the care of children with
apnea  or  "near-miss"  SIDS  is either very difficult or of little value. This
article,  which  is  based  upon  the  program  at  The  Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia,  describes  an effective management plan for identifying children
at  risk,  lists  appropriate  evaluation  studies,  and  presents  a series of
protocols  for  treating infants with apnea. The initiation of this program has
helped  to  demystify  the  care  of children with apnea and has been very well

  A  system of pneumographic study of infants considered at increased risk from
the  sudden  infant death syndrome is described. It is simple for nursing staff
to  use  and for clinicians to interpret. A total of 166 'at risk' infants were
studied and 85 were subsequently monitored at home. Seventeen of these infants,
16  of  whom  had  had  abnormal pneumograms, subsequently suffered significant
apnoea.  Four of 20 babies who had abnormal pneumograms did not have subsequent
episodes of apnoea. Two babies died; the first was on a monitor but the second,
despite having had an abnormal pneumogram, was not.

  Between  July  1978  and December 1981, 64 infants thought to be at increased
risk  from  sudden  infant  death  syndrome  (SIDS)  were monitored at home for
central  apnoea.  Twenty  four  of the infants had had a 'near miss' episode at
age,  median  (range),  6  (1 to 33) weeks, and of these infants 22 had had 335
alarms for apnoea by age 6 months. Stimulation by shaking was carried out on 38
occasions  and bag and mask resuscitation on one. The remaining 40 infants were
siblings  of  SIDS  victims  and  of  these,  35 were monitored from age 1 week
(usually  after  discharge  home). Thirty four of the SIDS siblings had had 573
alarms for apnoea by age 6 months: stimulation by shaking was carried out on 32
occasions  and  bag  and  mask  resuscitation  on  one.  The  duration  of home
monitoring  was, median (range), 34 (8 to 87) weeks for 'near miss' infants and

  To  determine  the efficacy of theophylline treatment in infants at increased
risk  for  SIDS, we obtained 24-hour cardiorespiratory recordings (pneumograms)
in  80  infants given theophylline in whom the initial pneumogram was abnormal.
Fifty-three  infants  had  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  near-SIDS,  and  27 were
asymptomatic  siblings  with  a  positive  family history for SIDS. The initial
pneumogram  was  obtained at a mean age of 6.9 weeks, and the repeat pneumogram
2.3  weeks  later,  when the mean theophylline blood concentration was 11.2 +/-
0.5  micrograms/ml.  Theophylline  treatment  resulted in comparable and highly
significant  improvements  in  both groups. Among all 80 infants, apnea density
decreased from 1.6 +/- 0.2% (SEM) to 0.3 +/- 0.1% (P less than 0.001), periodic
breathing  episodes/100  minutes  decreased  from 2.7 +/- 0.4 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 (P

  A SIDS sibling is described who showed a normal respiratory regulation at 1.5
months  but  who  was  equipped  with an apnea monitor at home on psychological
indications.  At 3 months he had a near-miss SIDS episode. He was then found to
have  developed  a  reaction  to hypoxia with appearance of periodic breathing.
With theophylline this response pattern was normalized but despite theophylline
medication episodes of prolonged apnea occurred.

  In  the  years  1973-79,  39452 infants born to parents resident in Sheffield
were  scored  at  birth  for  risk  of  unexpected  infant  death.  Before 1973
post-perinatal  mortality  in Sheffield was on average 11.5% above the rate for
England  and  Wales.  Since 1973 it has only once exceeded the rate for England
and  Wales. "Possibly preventable" deaths have fallen from 5.2 to 1.9 per 1000.
12%  of this decline is associated with a rise in the average age of the mother
and  a  fall  in  the number of pregnancies, 9% with a reduction in precipitate
deliveries, 24% with an increase in breastfeeding, 18% with extra care given by
health visitors to high-risk infants, and 36% with other factors. The reduction

  Electronic monitors were used at home to detect apnea in 134 infants who were
considered  to  be at risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Seventy-two
infants had idiopathic apnea at a mean age of 2.2 +/- 1.4 (+/- 1 SD) months. Of
these,  31  subsequently had prolonged apnea (greater than 20 seconds) with the
last  spell  occurring  at 6.2 +/- 3.2 months of age. Fourteen infants required
vigorous stimulation on at least one occasion and 14 had more than ten separate
episodes.  Eighteen infants with awake apnea had a significantly smaller chance
of  subsequent  spells (P less than .05). Ten additional term infants had apnea

  The  study  was  carried out to validate objectively the relationship between
clinical   impressions   of   parents  and  ECG  evidence  of  life-threatening
arrhythmias in infants considered to be at high risk. Twenty infants considered
to be at high risk were provided with a hospital grade home monitor with a hard
copy-recording  capability (n = 12) and/or an ECG telephone transmission system
(n  = 8). There were 93 alarms considered by the parents as true alarms. All of
the   ECG  tracings  recorded  during  the  93  episodes  were  normal.  Infant
stimulation  was  provided for 11 infants and was not administered during 82 of
these  alarms.  None of the infants died and all are well at 1 year of age. Our
data raises questions regarding parental clinical ability to correctly perceive
a  true  near  miss episode in most cases and may explain, in part, the lack of
consistency  noted  in  previously published physiologic studies of "high risk"
populations.  Finally,  the study raises further questions regarding the use of
parental  impression  alone  without supportive objective data as an indication
for  therapy in the majority of such patients. Research efforts and application
of  therapeutic  measures will benefit greatly by development of objective data
to support and supplement parental clinical observations.

  Theophylline and caffeine are two drugs frequently administered to infants at
risk  for sudden infant death syndrome, because of their stimulatory effects on
the  respiratory  system.  These  drugs  are  known  to  increase  gastric acid
secretion  and  to  decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure that, in turn,
possibly increases gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Thirty babies were tested for
GER  before and during caffeine treatment. Eighteen were studied under the same
conditions   while   undergoing  theophylline  treatment.  All  results  of  pH
monitoring  before  treatment  were  within  normal  ranges.  Episodes  of  GER
increased  significantly  (P  less than .001) in about 50% of the group treated
with  caffeine and in 66% of the group treated with theophylline. These results
were independent of plasma xanthine concentrations (within or below therapeutic
ranges) and of the efficacy of the drug. In addition, an increase was noted for
the  number  of  episodes  of GER in 24 hours (from 5.3 to 17.1 in the caffeine
group  and  from 5.3 to 24.3 in the theophylline group) and for the time pH was
less  than  4  (from  0.87%  to  6%  in the caffeine group and up to 13% in the
theophylline group). Because GER is another known risk factor for sudden infant
death  syndrome,  the  administration of xanthine derivatives in babies at risk
for sudden infant death syndrome should be carefully considered in each case.

  Home  apnea/bradycardia  monitoring  is  frequently used in the management of
infants  at  increased  risk  for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However,
some  infants  have  died  despite evaluation by infant apnea programs, and the
benefits  of  home  monitoring  remain unproven. To determine the SIDS rate and
risk  factors  of infants evaluated by infant apnea programs, 31 apnea programs
and  ten  home monitor vendors in California were surveyed. Eleven (35%) of the
apnea  programs  and  four  (40%)  of  the  vendors  responded. Information was
obtained  on  26  infants  who  died.  Thirteen  (50%) deaths were due to SIDS.
Abnormal  sleep  studies  did not predict death. Fifteen infants died despite a
recommendation  for  home monitoring. Seven deaths occurred in association with
technical  errors  or  noncompliance  with  monitoring. Four deaths were due to
nonaccidental  trauma.  The  apnea  programs  evaluated  3,406 infants during a
5-year  period;  1,841  had  monitoring  recommended.  Term infants with apnea,
subsequent  siblings of SIDS victims, and infants evaluated at referral centers
were  more  likely  to  have monitoring recommended than premature infants with
apnea  or infants evaluated at nonreferral centers (P less than .0001). Infants
who had monitoring recommended were at equal risk of dying of SIDS as those who
did not.

Dual  respiration recordings were made from infants exhibiting apnoeic episodes
to  compare  the  new  monitor  with  an  acceptable reference monitor (Graesby

parents  with a subsequent child after previously suffering a cot death. Apnoea
monitors  were  used  in  one  group  and weighing scales in the other. General
support  measures  given  to both groups included the keeping of symptom charts
and  weekly visits by health visitors. Many alarms occurred which were presumed
to  be  false.  Eleven  per  cent  fewer  symptoms  were reported by parents of
children on monitors than parents of children being weighed daily. Both systems
were  acceptable  and  gave  parents confidence. Sixty per cent of parents were
reluctant  to  give  up  using  the  monitor compared with 26% of parents using
scales.  Virtually  all parents commented on the great value of the weekly home
visit of the health visitor and the symptom diary.

  Rapid  eye  movement (REM) sleep seems to protect infants from developing the
sudden  infant  death  syndrome (SIDS). A biological rhythm involving the locus
ceruleus  and  the  dorsal  raphe nucleus has been related to melatonin and REM
sleep.  The  same rhythm is present in the medial parabrachial nucleus which is
an  oscilator  for  pneumotaxic  activity.  Tryptophan  has  been  shown  to be
effective  in  some  adult  sleep  apneas and to increase REM sleep in infants.
Tryptophan  -  serotonin  -  melatonin deficiencies are suggested as a possible
cause of SIDS.

were  admitted  because  of NSIDS (near sudden infant death syndrome) episodes.
Three  out  of  the  five  children  showed  blocking  of  vertebral  bloodflow
determined  by  position of the head. This was not observed in five age-matched
controls.  Our  preliminary  observations  indicate  the  value  of noninvasive

NSIDS. In this way one of the risk factors for SIDS might be identified.

  Apnea  of  infancy  represents  a problem that is commonly encountered by the
practicing  pediatrician;  yet,  few  publications  have  outlined  a practical
approach  to  the care of such infants. In addition, the somewhat controversial
aspects  of  infant apnea and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have resulted
in  the  belief  on  the part of many physicians that the care of children with
apnea  or  "near-miss"  SIDS  is either very difficult or of little value. This
article,  which  is  based  upon  the  program  at  The  Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia,  describes  an effective management plan for identifying children
at  risk,  lists  appropriate  evaluation  studies,  and  presents  a series of
protocols  for  treating infants with apnea. The initiation of this program has
helped  to  demystify  the  care  of children with apnea and has been very well
received by both parents and physicians.

  A  system of pneumographic study of infants considered at increased risk from
the  sudden  infant death syndrome is described. It is simple for nursing staff
to  use  and for clinicians to interpret. A total of 166 'at risk' infants were
studied and 85 were subsequently monitored at home. Seventeen of these infants,
16  of  whom  had  had  abnormal pneumograms, subsequently suffered significant
apnoea.  Four of 20 babies who had abnormal pneumograms did not have subsequent
episodes of apnoea. Two babies died; the first was on a monitor but the second,
despite having had an abnormal pneumogram, was not.

  Between  July  1978  and December 1981, 64 infants thought to be at increased
risk  from  sudden  infant  death  syndrome  (SIDS)  were monitored at home for
central  apnoea.  Twenty  four  of the infants had had a 'near miss' episode at
age,  median  (range),  6  (1 to 33) weeks, and of these infants 22 had had 335
alarms for apnoea by age 6 months. Stimulation by shaking was carried out on 38
occasions  and bag and mask resuscitation on one. The remaining 40 infants were

alarms for apnoea by age 6 months: stimulation by shaking was carried out on 32
occasions  and  bag  and  mask  resuscitation  on  one.  The  duration  of home
monitoring  was, median (range), 34 (8 to 87) weeks for 'near miss' infants and
45 (12 to 70) weeks for SIDS siblings. All infants survived. As part of an over
all  support  system  monitors  were  accepted  and greatly appreciated by most
parents, especially those with previous experience of SIDS. Home monitoring was
practicable  but  the  commitment in time and expertise was great and objective
benefits to the infant remain unproved.

  To  determine  the efficacy of theophylline treatment in infants at increased
risk  for  SIDS, we obtained 24-hour cardiorespiratory recordings (pneumograms)
in  80  infants given theophylline in whom the initial pneumogram was abnormal.
Fifty-three  infants  had  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  near-SIDS,  and  27 were
asymptomatic  siblings  with  a  positive  family history for SIDS. The initial
pneumogram  was  obtained at a mean age of 6.9 weeks, and the repeat pneumogram
2.3  weeks  later,  when the mean theophylline blood concentration was 11.2 +/-
0.5  micrograms/ml.  Theophylline  treatment  resulted in comparable and highly
significant  improvements  in  both groups. Among all 80 infants, apnea density
decreased from 1.6 +/- 0.2% (SEM) to 0.3 +/- 0.1% (P less than 0.001), periodic
breathing  episodes/100  minutes  decreased  from 2.7 +/- 0.4 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 (P
less  than 0.001), and the longest apneic period decreased from 13.5 +/- 0.7 to
10.1  +/-  0.5  seconds  (P less than 0.001). Findings on the pneumogram became
completely  normal  with  theophylline therapy in 87% of infants with near-SIDS
and  81.5%  of  asymptomatic  siblings. Pneumogram normalization was associated
with absence of further symptomatic sleep apnea in the near-SIDS group and with
continued  absence  of any clinical symptoms in the asymptomatic family history
group. There were no deaths from SIDS.

  A SIDS sibling is described who showed a normal respiratory regulation at 1.5
months  but  who  was  equipped  with an apnea monitor at home on psychological
indications.  At 3 months he had a near-miss SIDS episode. He was then found to
have  developed  a  reaction  to hypoxia with appearance of periodic breathing.
With theophylline this response pattern was normalized but despite theophylline
medication episodes of prolonged apnea occurred.

  Prevention of unexpected infant death. Evaluation of the first seven years of

  In  the  years  1973-79,  39452 infants born to parents resident in Sheffield
were  scored  at  birth  for  risk  of  unexpected  infant  death.  Before 1973
post-perinatal  mortality  in Sheffield was on average 11.5% above the rate for
England  and  Wales.  Since 1973 it has only once exceeded the rate for England
and  Wales. "Possibly preventable" deaths have fallen from 5.2 to 1.9 per 1000.
12%  of this decline is associated with a rise in the average age of the mother
and  a  fall  in  the number of pregnancies, 9% with a reduction in precipitate
deliveries, 24% with an increase in breastfeeding, 18% with extra care given by
health visitors to high-risk infants, and 36% with other factors. The reduction
in  mortality  attributed  directly  to  the  effect  of  increased visiting of
high-risk  infants  is  numerically  similar  to  the  number of lives saved by
treating  cancers  of  children.  This  suggests  that  home visiting by health
visitors is highly cost-effective.

  From  1977  to 1981, 500 infants had been referred to evaluate their risk for
the  sudden  infant  death  syndrome (SIDS). These included 186 infants who had
presented  an  event (prolonged apnea, hypotonia, pallor or cyanosis) initiated
while asleep, 133 siblings and 181 "controls". All-night polygraphic recordings
were  performed in all infants, and if indicated by the history of the infants,
complementary  clinical  investigations  were done. These procedures led to the
identification  of  50  infants  considered  at  risk  for  SIDS  (10%  of  all
referrals):  30  near-misses  for SIDS, 10 siblings and 10 infants with a minor
incident  during  sleep  but  with  abnormal  polygraphic  recordings. These 50
infants  (group  I)  were  monitored  at  home  during sleep with the help of a
cardiac  and  respiratory  monitor.  Eight  infants not considered at risk were
monitored similarly at the request of their parents (group II). Forty of the 50
infants in group I presented with repetitive sleep apneas and bradycardias, and
required  stimulation  by  their  parents  to  regain  normal cardiorespiratory
rhythm.  Twelve  had  to  be  resuscitated at least once for a life-threatening
event.  None  of the infants in group II showed alarms during sleep. Monitoring
could  be  discontinued  after  a  mean length of 7.2 months for the infants in
group  I,  4.1  months  in group II. It is concluded that if identified in time
through  adequate  investigations,  some  infants may be protected against SIDS
through  home  monitoring.  This  approach  requires expensive and well trained
teams,  ready,  at  any  time,  to cope with the problems that may arise in the
homes of the monitored infants.

  Electronic monitors were used at home to detect apnea in 134 infants who were
considered  to  be at risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Seventy-two
infants had idiopathic apnea at a mean age of 2.2 +/- 1.4 (+/- 1 SD) months. Of
these,  31  subsequently had prolonged apnea (greater than 20 seconds) with the
last  spell  occurring  at 6.2 +/- 3.2 months of age. Fourteen infants required
vigorous stimulation on at least one occasion and 14 had more than ten separate
episodes.  Eighteen infants with awake apnea had a significantly smaller chance
of  subsequent  spells (P less than .05). Ten additional term infants had apnea
during  the first week of life but none had subsequent episodes. Of 52 siblings
of  SIDS  victims,  only seven had had apnea before monitoring started. Sixteen
had  prolonged apnea while on a monitor; seven required vigorous stimulation on
at   least   one   occasion   and   one  infant  died  despite  cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.  The  first  documented spell in these 16 infants was at 2.6 +/-
2.1 months and the last at 7.2 +/- 2.7 months of age. Ten infants had more than
ten  subsequent spells. A tendency to clustering of spells was noted. Preceding
events,  especially  a mild upper respiratory tract infection, were noted in 36
of the 47 infants who had apnea on the home monitor.
