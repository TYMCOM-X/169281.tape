  An inquiry was circulated among all Departments of Gynaecology
and Obstetrics in West Germany and West-Berlin  with  regard  to
their  procedure  to effect foetal intensive-care management and
monitoring,  obstetrical management,  and the results  obtained.
58% of these Departments responded. With an average number of 55
beds,   the  annual birth rate is 628.  A mean of 191 births are
covered by one CTG unit,  the scatter being 110-290  births  per
year and per unit (10th and 90th percentile). The mean incidence
of  Caesarean  section  is  11%,   the mean incidence of forceps
delivery 3.6%,  and the mean incidence of extraction by  suction
8.0%.   An  estimated  95%   of  all  births  are  monitored via
cardiotocography.  25%  of all Departments use other  monitoring
methods  as well,  microanalysis of blood gas after Saling being
by far the most prominent one (94%).  Transcutaneous foetal  pO2
measurement  has  been  adopted  by 8 centres only.  74%  of the
Departments are using CTG units recording  beat-to-beat  with  a
chart  speed of 1 cm per minute (82.2%).  Few (18%)  Departments
employ intrauterine pressure measurement  for  recording  labour
pains.  Telemetry is used by 27.7%  of the Departments.  In most
cases (72.9%)  the cardiotocograms are jointly assessed  by  the
physician and the midwife. From the obstetrician's point of view
it would be desirable to achieve greater technical perfection of
external monitoring methods,  as well as further miniaturisation
and computerisation of the CTG equipment.

  Out-of-hospital  births  in  Alabama  are  characterized  with
special  emphasis on the period from 1970 to 1980.  Women having
an out-of-hospital birth were more likely to be nonwhite,   aged
greater than or equal to 35,  and multiparous and to have little
or no prenatal care.  However,  within the group of women having
out-of-hospital   delivery,    characteristics  which  predicted
neonatal  death  included  being  white,   aged  less  than  20,
primiparous,   and  unmarried  and  having little or no prenatal
care.  Both the risk factors for and outcomes of out-of-hospital
birth differed markedly by race. In all, out-of-hospital births,
which declined from 25% to 0.5% of all births from 1940 to 1980,
were  associated  with a twofold increase in neonatal mortality.
The major care provider for out-of-hospital births, the "granny"
midwife, was found to have little knowledge about, or ability to
provide,   modern  obstetric  care.   High-risk  status  of  the
patients,   limited  capability of the care-givers,  and lack of
appropriate  medical  resources  are  suggested  as  the  likely
reasons  for  the  excess  neonatal mortality in out-of-hospital
births.

  The authors analyse the results of 4 years home supervision of
high-risk pregnancies by hospital midwives. The inquiry concerns
813 women out of a total of 12,643 deliveries in the same period
of time (1978-1981).  This supervision deals with the people who
were  selected by patient consultation or after hospitalisation.
It is  particularly  concerned  with  patients  with  threatened
premature labour.  The role of the midwife is at once medical in
that she undertakes a  constant  review  of  the  state  of  the
pregnancy,   and social and psychological.  Domiciliary visiting
can often take the place of admission to hospital.  Even  though
has not been a great decrease in the number of premature labours
it  does  seen  certain  that patients who have been followed in
this way have had pregnancies that have lasted longer.  Over the
4  years  when  the  experience  has  been  gained the number of
deliveries occurring before the 34th week has dropped  from  2.8
to  1%.   Finally,  it is an extremely efficient way of lowering
hospital expenses.

  Neonatal mortality examined  by  place  and  circumstances  of
delivery  in  North  Carolina  during  1974  through  1976  with
attention given to home delivery.  Planned  home  deliveries  by
lay-midwives  resulted  in  three neonatal deaths per 1,000 live
births;  planned home  deliveries  without  a  lay-midwife,   30
neonatal  deaths  per  1,000  live  births;   and unplanned home
deliveries, 120 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births. The women
babies were delivered by lay-midwives were  screened  in  county
health  departments  and  found  to  be medically at low risk of
complication,   despite   having   demographic   characteristics
associated with high-risk of neonatal mortality. Conversely, the
women  delivered  at  home without known prenatal screening or a
trained attendant had low-risk demographic  characteristics  but
experienced  a  high  rate  of  neonatal  mortality.   Planning,
prenatal screening,  and attendant-training  were  important  in
differentiating   the   risk   of  neonatal  mortality  in  this
uncontrolled, observational study.

  An  examination  of  1978  natality data for the United States
disclosed that low birth weight was  less  common  among  30,819
infants  born  out of hospital than among 3,294,101 infants born
in hospital in that year.  When controls were applied for  birth
attendant, infants' race, and mothers' education, age, nativity,
and  parity,  the data revealed that white,  well-educated women
between 25 and 39 years of age,  who were  having  their  second
babies  and  were attended by midwives out of hospital,  were at
least risk of bearing low birth weight infants.   The  incidence
rate  of  low birth weight babies was lower for midwife-attended
births in every category examined.  For  college-educated  white
women,   for  example,  the incidence rate was 2.0 percent among
those attended by midwives, 4.6 percent among those giving birth
in hospital,  and 3.6 percent among those whose  out-of-hospital
deliveries were attended by physicians.  Apgar scores for babies
born both in and out of hospital were also studied but,  because
of inconsistent reporting, were given less attention.  Excellent
(9-10)  Apgar scores were more common among babies born  out  of
hospital  than among those born in hospital (63 percent compared
with  49  percent),   particularly  for  out-of-hospital  births
attended  by  physicians.  At least with respect to birth weight
and Apgar scores,  the claim  that  out-of-hospital  births  are
inherently  more  dangerous  than  hospital  births  receives no
support from these data.  The findings also suggest the need for
further  refinement of vital statistics categories to permit the
analysis of distinctions between births  attended  by  certified
nurse-midwives  and  those attended by lay midwives,  as well as
differences between births at  home  and  those  in  alternative
birth centers.

  Our study of 390 patients enrolled in a birthing suite program
revealed  that  antepartum  or intrapartum problems allowed only
160 (41%)   to  actually  give  birth  in  the  birthing  suite.
Antepartum complications included premature labor in ten (2.5%),
premature ruptured membranes in 31 (8%), postdatism in 50 (13%),
preeclampsia  in 27 (7%),  and diabetes mellitus in five (1.3%).
Intrapartum complications included meconium in 62 (16%),  arrest
of labor in 64 (16%), oxytocin use in 85 (22%),  and fetal heart
rate decelerations in 28 (7%).  Two hundred ninety-seven  births
(76%) were spontaneous.  Forty-two low-forceps deliveries (10%),
12 mid-forceps deliveries (3%),  and 39 cesarean sections  (10%)
were done in the traditional labor and delivery suite. Puerperal
complications  included  one  uterine  inversion,   two cases of
placenta accreta, one rectovaginal fistula, and two requirements
of blood transfusion.  Neonatal morbidity included 22 low  Apgar
scores  (7%),   two  shoulder  dystocia,   three cytomegalovirus
infestations,  and one lethal anomaly.  Six infants had meconium
aspiration, two with severe hypoxia.  Any of these complications
would overwhelm the patient in  home  birth.   Intense  prenatal
screening  may  decrease some risk factors,  but the intrapartum
period was found to pose unacceptable risks for  home  birth  in
this population.

  In The Netherlands 34-35%  of all deliveries still take  place
at home, but with considerable regional differences. A study was
made  of  the  relation between the perinatal mortality rate and
the percentage of hospital deliveries in the 11 provinces of The
Netherlands,  in municipalities divided into groups according to
the  number of inhabitants,  and in the 17 cities with more than
100,000 inhabitants.  No relation could be demonstrated  between
the  regional percentage of hospital deliveries and the regional
perinatal mortality rate.  The proportion of  hospital  delivery
appears  not  to  be  a  major  factor  determining the regional
perinatal mortality rate in the current system of obstetric care
in The Netherlands.

  A  comparison  was  made  between  two  types   of   obstetric
organization: total hospitalization as in Denmark,  and a system
that  allows  a  choice  between  hospital  and  home  delivery,
provided  there  are  no  medical contra-indications,  as in The
Netherlands. Until the end of the 1950s,  the current Dutch view
prevailed  in  Denmark;  Denmark changed its organization in the
late 1960s and followed the international preference  for  total
hospitalization.   This  change  was not caused by disappointing
obstetric results, nor was it the result of strong pressure from
pregnant women.  The change was associated with  a  considerable
increase  in  instrumental  deliveries.   In  both countries the
perinatal mortality rate decreased continuously but  in  Denmark
the improvement in early neonatal mortality was slightly faster.
 This  difference  may  have  occurred  because  of insufficient
referral  in  The  Netherlands  of  high-risk  pregnancies   and
deliveries  to  the  fully  equipped obstetric departments.  The
Dutch acceptance of a high proportion  of  home-confinements  is
unlikely to be the explanation.

  Policies  about place of delivery have tended to be formulated
without  either  looking  at  existing  evidence  or  doing  new
research  into  the  relative  safety  for  women  and babies of
delivery in different settings.  This article reviews  published
research  on  the  subject,   and  finds  that  many of the data
required have not been collected.  Furthermore,   many  analyses
fail  to  take account of selection biases or differences in the
birthweight  distribution  and  the  incidence   of   congenital
malformations   among   babies   born   in  different  settings.
Nevertheless,  some tentative conclusions  can  be  drawn.   The
available  evidence does not support claims that,  for the baby,
the iatrogenic risks  of  obstetric  intervention  outweigh  the
possible  benefits.   At the same time,  there is no evidence to
support the  claim  that  the  shift  to  hospital  delivery  is
responsible  for  the  decline in perinatal mortality in England
and Wales nor the claim that the safest policy is for all  women
to be delivered in hospital.   (51 Refs.)

  Impartial  analyses  of the evidence from official statistics,
national surveys and specific  studies  consistently  find  that
perinatal  mortality  is  much  higher when obstetric intranatal
interventions are used,  as in consultant hospitals,  than  when
they  are  little  used,   as in unattached general practitioner
maternity units and at home.  The conclusion  holds  even  after
allowance  has been made for the higher pre-delivery risk status
of hospital births as a  result  of  the  booking  and  transfer
policies. It holds even more strongly for births at high than at
low  predicted  risk.   It  follows  that  the  increased use of
interventions,  implied by increased hospitalization,  could not
have  been  the  cause  of the decline in the national perinatal
mortality rate over the last 50 years and analysis of results by
different methods confirms that the latter would  have  declined
more  in  the  absence  of the former.  Data are presented which
point  to  the  deleterious  effect  of  interventions  on   the
incidence  of  low  birthweight  and  short  gestation and their
associated mortality.  Also presented are  data  supporting  the
alternative  explanation  of the decline in perinatal mortality,
namely the improvement in the health status of mothers built  up
over  several  generations.   The  organization of the maternity
service stands indicted by the evidence.  Despite the beliefs of
those responsible, it has not promoted, and cannot promote,  the
objective of reducing perinatal mortality.

  The  low  birthweight (LBW)  rate among reported United States
non-White births increased 32 per cent from 1950 to 1967. States
with large increments in non-White LBW  rates  over  the  period
1950-67 ("rising LBW states")  were compared to states with more
stable  LBW  rates.   Paradoxically,   states  with   the   most
deterioration  in LBW rates had the most improvement in LBW risk
factors (low income, mothers under age 20 or over age 35,  birth
order  over four).  In 1950,  at least 9.7 per cent of non-White
births in rising LBW states went unreported,  and underreporting
was biased,  with out-of-hospital LBW births who die young least
likely  to  be  reported.   From  1950   to   1967,    non-White
out-of-hospital births for the US declined from 42 per cent to 7
per cent,  and yearly values for per cent of non-White births in
hospital and LBW rates were highly correlated (r =  .98).  These
data  suggest that the observed rise in non-White LBW rates from
1950 to 1967 was due in large part to systematic  underreporting
of  LBW births among non-White out-of-hospital deliveries in the
1950s.  This underreporting  essentially  ceased  when  hospital
delivery  for  non-Whites  became  nearly  universal in the late
1950s and 1960s.

  All cases (77)  of perinatal death between 1981  to  1983  are
described  and  discussed.   15  pregnant  patients  arrived for
delivery without any examination during the  pregnancy.   In  11
cases perinatal death happened in spite of regular examinations.
 The  distance  between  the  last  examination  and the date of
perinatal death was  in  every  case  more  than  4  weeks.   15
malformations could be registrated. 5 gravidae delivered at home
and  there the fetus died.  A mistake in our management could be
found 3 times.

  We conducted a survey of 1,064 out-of-hospital Kentucky births
during 1981 to 1983 in order to classify each by planning status
(planned  or unplanned to occur out of hospital)  and attendant.
Among the 809 births for which  we  obtained  information,   575
(71.1%)   were  planned.  We examined birth outcome by low birth
weight (LBW) and neonatal mortality (NM).  Compared with planned
births,  unplanned births were associated with increased risk of
LBW (odds ratio = 6.6; 95% confidence limits [CL],  3.9 to 11.2,
adjusted  for  maternal age).  Furthermore,  after adjusting for
maternal age and parity,   LBW  births  occurred  at  less  than
expected  frequency  among  planned births (observed to expected
[O:E] ratio = 0.48; 95% CL,  0.29 to 0.73),  but at greater than
expected frequency among unplanned births (O:E ratio = 2.9;  95%
CL, 2.2 to 3.8). A similar,  but nonsignificant,  trend was seen
for  NM and NM was much greater in the unplanned group (72.7 per
1,000 live births) than in the planned group (3.5 per 1,000).

  A  survey was carried out of all 8856 births occurring at home
in England and Wales in 1979.  Of these births,  67%   had  been
booked for delivery at home, 21% had been booked for delivery in
hospital, 3% had not been booked, and for 9%  the intended place
of delivery was unknown.  The perinatal mortality varied  almost
50-fold  according  to  the intended place of delivery,  ranging
from 4.1/1000 births in those booked for  delivery  at  home  to
196.6/1000 unbooked births. Deliveries that occurred at home but
had  been  booked for a hospital consultant unit were associated
with a perinatal mortality of 67.5/1000.  Births that  had  been
booked  for delivery at home included the smallest proportion of
babies of low birth weight: 2.5% weighed 2500 g or less compared
with 18%  of those booked for consultant units and 29%  of those
not  booked.   Within  these  low  birthweight groups there were
noticeable differences in perinatal mortality;  births booked to
occur  at  home had the lowest mortality and unbooked births had
the highest.  Perinatal mortality among babies who weighed  more
than 2500 g was generally low irrespective of the intended place
of delivery; the only exception was in babies whose delivery had
not   been  booked.   In  all  groups  perinatal  mortality  was
considerably higher in nulliparous  than  parous  women.   Women
booking  a  delivery  at home are clearly a selected group,  and
some may have been transferred to  hospital  during  labour  and
were thus not included in the survey.  Nevertheless,  these data
suggest that the perinatal  mortality  among  births  booked  to
occur at home is low, especially for parous women.

  The   observation   that   perinatal  mortality  among  babies
delivered at home has  tended  to  increase  beyond  that  among
babies  delivered in consultant obstetric units has caused alarm
and prompted recommendations that delivery  at  home  should  be
further  phased  out.  With data derived from the Cardiff Births
Survey the possibility was investigated that  this  trend  might
reflect  a  changing  ratio  of planned to unplanned domiciliary
births.  At the beginning of the 1970s deliveries at  home  that
were  planned to be so outnumbered those that were not by nearly
five to one.  By 1979 unplanned deliveries at  home  outnumbered
planned  deliveries.   The  characteristics of the mothers,  the
health care they received,  and the outcome of delivery differed
strikingly between planned and unplanned deliveries at home.  It
is concluded,  firstly,  that every year the maternity  services
must  try  to  meet  the  various  needs  of about 2000 women in
England and Wales who give birth at home without planning to  do
so; and, secondly,  that the heterogeneity of births at home and
in hospital will continue to obstruct the  search  for  unbiased
estimates  of  the  risks attributable to delivery in specialist
obstetric units, general practitioner units, and at home.

rural  Zulu  women  and  their infants after home delivery.  The
results of  a  pilot  project  for  training  traditional  birth
attendants  (TBAs)   in  the  area  are  described.  The authors
conclude that potentially there is an important place  for  TBAs
in  the  obstetric  services of rural South Africa and recommend
official  recognition  and   preliminary   extension   of   this
programme.

  The  efficacy  of  the  Dutch  system  of  obstetric  care was
investigated by comparison of the  outcomes  of  two  groups  of
supposedly  normal  first  pregnancies  and deliveries that were
solely cared for by midwives (n =  85)  or by gynecologists (n =
27). The outcome was measured by pH,  PCO2,  and base deficit in
arterial cord  blood  (early  morbidity)   and  by  neurological
examination   with   Prechtl's  method  (late  morbidity).   The
occurrence  of  10  neurologically  nonoptimal  infants  in  the
midwife  group is thought incompatible with the basis philosophy
of the Dutch obstetric system,  which is that midwives are  able
to  select  the normal pregnancies out of the group of women who
present for obstetric care and can  assist  in  maintaining  the
normal  state in these selected cases in the course of delivery.
The acid-base values were less favorable in  the  midwife  group
than  in  the gynecologist group.  Neurological nonoptimality in
the midwife group was related to acidosis.  The influence of the
site of birth (home or hospital--ambulatory)  could be virtually
ruled out.
