  Auditory arousal thresholds of normal and near-miss SIDS infants.

  The  sleep  characteristics  and  auditory arousal thresholds of 20 near-miss
sudden  infant death syndrome (SIDS) infants and 97 age- and sex-matched normal
infants  were  studied.  It  was  observed  that  spontaneous arousals occurred
significantly  less  frequently  in the near-miss SIDS infants. In both groups,
induced  arousals  occurred  at comparable stimulation intensities, and arousal
thresholds  decreased  significantly from the 44th to the 52nd postconceptional
week.  This supports the notion that both groups present a similar maturational
process  within  the  auditory  pathways and brainstem, and that arousal is not
related to differences in behavioural response to ambient noise during sleep.

  Fourteen  cries  of  a  four day old infant who subsequently died suddenly of
unexplained causes were analyzed on nine acoustic characteristics including fo,
duration,  formant  frequencies  and  sound  pressure level. In comparison to a
group  of  newborn  controls,  the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) victim's
cries  exhibited  a  lower  fo,  longer duration, lower formant frequencies and
greater  sound  pressure  level throughout the spectrum. Cry duration and sound
pressure levels, however, deviated in excess on one standard deviation from the
mean  of the other newborns. Similar findings resulted when the SIDS infant was
compared  to  a  group  of full term infants who were siblings of SIDS victims,
although  the  magnitude  of  the differences was slightly less especially with
respect  to sound pressure level. Measurement of selected acoustic variables in
a  newborn's  cry  may  be  of  value  in  our  understanding  of  SIDS and for
identifying infants at risk.

  Heart rate dependence of the RT interval in the first month of life.

  Computer  analysis  of more than 100 000 RT and RR intervals obtained from 70
babies  spanning  the age range 2-75 d indicates that the RR-RT relation cannot
be  characterised  by  any  general formula during the first month of life. The
babies included 22 sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), 22 matched controls and
26  normal  infants. RT intervals were corrected for RR variation for each baby
using  linear  regression  analysis.  The corrected RT interval was observed to
increase  sharply  during the first month of life for each group of babies. The
similarity in the results for all three groups suggest that an investigation of
the   RT  interval  will  contribute  very  little,  if  anything,  to  a  SIDS
investigation.

  Effects  of  birth  weight  and ethnicity on incidence of sudden infant death

  Sudden  infant  death  syndrome  occurs with increased frequency in low birth
weight  infants  and  in black infants. The degree to which the higher LBW rate
among  blacks  might  explain this higher SIDS rate is unknown. To address this
question, we analyzed the 1233 SIDS deaths that occurred among 252,376 neonatal
survivors in Cook County from 1975 to 1980, using computer-coded matched infant
birth  and  death  records.  Birth weight and ethnic group were identified. The
overall SIDS rates in blacks, Hispanics, and whites were 5.1, 1.2, and 1.3/1000
neonatal  survivors,  respectively.  Within  each  ethnic group, the SIDS rates
increased  progressively  with decreasing birth weight. Within the less than or
equal  to  1500  gm  birth  weight  groups,  the SIDS rates were 16.4, 3.9, and
5.5/1000  neonatal  survivors  in  blacks,  Hispanics, and whites. Using direct
standardization,  we  found  that 27% of the SIDS rate disparity between blacks
and  whites  could  be explained by the higher LBW rate in blacks (14% vs 6% in
whites).  The  good  outcomes  in  both  LBW  and  SIDS  rates for the Hispanic
population    were    unexpected    because,   like   blacks,   Hispanics   are
socioeconomically  disadvantaged.  Findings  for  this  group  suggest that the
remaining  73%  of  the increased SIDS rate in blacks cannot be attributed in a
straightforward manner to differences in income or educational attainment.

  Trends  in  out-of-hospital  births  for the State of Michigan, 1972-79, were
examined  by  analyzing  (a) location of deliveries, (b) characteristics of the
mother,  (c)  use of health services, and (d) characteristics of the newborn. A
large  increase occurred in the number of births at the mother's home and other
nonhospital  sites  for  both  the  black  and the white populations. For white
women,  the  increase  was  associated with better education and greater use of
prenatal  care.  Physician attendance for deliveries at mother's home declined.
Birth  weights  for  home-born infants increased significantly over the period,
more  so  for  whites  than  for  blacks;  mortality  declined  in some groups,
especially  for  high-birth-weight  babies  born at the mother's home. Assuming

that the rise in home births in the 1970s was due to an increase in planned and
not  precipitate  home  deliveries,  the  authors  concluded  that these trends
reflect, at least in part, the impact of planned out-of-hospital births. Toward
the end of the 1970s, both the conditions under which these births occurred and
some  of  their outcome measures were more characteristic of safety than at the
beginning of the period. Disaggregation by race demonstrated, however, that the
safety  factor  was not necessarily present for out-of-hospital births of black
infants.

  The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  determine  how  the  attitudinal  and
demographic  characteristics  of  pregnant  women  influence  their  choice  of
childbirth  procedure.  The  Fuchs-Self  pregnancy  research  questionnaire was
distributed  to 114 third-trimester women at prenatal visits. Women who planned
a  prepared  birth  tended to be better educated (p less than 0.02) and to have
less  stereotyped  thinking  about  child  rearing  (p less than 0.04) and more
belief  in reciprocity (i.e., two-way communications between mother and infant)
(p  less  than  0.01). Women who chose not to use medication had more belief in
reciprocity  (p less than 0.02) and more children (p less than 0.02). Women who
elected  rooming-in  at the hospital or a birth center had higher scores on the

  Completeness  and  accuracy  of  reporting  induced  abortions  performed  in

  This  study  examined  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of reporting induced
abortions  to the official agency by following up documented cases of abortions
performed in hospitals in Hawaii for the years 1970--74. The following two sets
of records were initially linked by computer on the basis of first name, maiden
name,  date  of  the  event,  age, and ethnic background: (a) a total of 18,531
induced  abortions  ascertained  in hospitals with complete linking information
and  (b)  official fetal death and live birth records filed at the State health
department. Overall, 96.1 percent of the hospital abortions were matched in the
official certificates. Of 17,550 abortions classified as elective, 98.7 percent
were  so  recorded in the certificate file, whereas the remainder were reported
as  mostly  either  therapeutic  or  unknown for cause of fetal death. When the
probability of matches for those abortions without complete linking information
and  possible  errors  in  the  information  were  considered, the estimates of
underreporting  to  the  health  department were a maximum of 3.9 percent and a
minimum  of  1.2  percent;  the  mean  value  was  2.6  percent.  The extent of
underreporting  of  induced  abortions  is becoming serious with the widespread
practice  of  abortion  procedures in nonhospital institutions in recent years.
The  results  of  the study also demonstrated the utility of the record-linkage
process  in  checking  data  for completeness and accuracy or studying separate
vital events on the same persons.
