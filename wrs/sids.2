  The  relationship  between chronic hypoxemia and sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS) has been reported by several authors. In order to study the influence of
the  apnea-time  during a sleep state on transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO2),
we  have  studied  polygraphically  30  full-term infants (10 controls, 10 SIDS
siblings  and  10  near-miss for SIDS), aged from 5 to 13 weeks. No significant
difference  was  observed  either for apnea-time or tcPO2 between infant-groups
studied  in  different  sleep states. We could not find any correlation between
apnea-time  and  tcPO2 in all groups of infants studied during different states
of  sleep.  It  is  therefore  concluded  that  in  normal and at risk for SIDS
infants,  tcPO2  levels  during  sleep  states  cannot be explained only by the
apnea-time.

  Between  1974 and 1984 we have studied 204 control infants (C) comparing them
with  650  SIDS  siblings  (SS)  and  146  near-miss for SIDS (NM). These 1,000
full-term  infants  were recorded by day polysomnography (DPSG; n = 417), night
polysomnography  (NPSG;  n  =  257)  and  cardiopneumography  (CPG; n = 2,600).
Records  were  visually  analyzed.  In  DPSG and NPSG, total amount of central,
mixed and obstructive apnea as well as the percentage of periodic breathing was
studied  in  each sleep state (active sleep, AS; quiet sleep, QS; indeterminate
sleep,  IS,  and  total  sleep, TS) and over the total recording time (TRT). In
CPG,  only  the  total  amount  of  central  apnea  and  percentage of periodic
breathing  over  TRT  were studied. Infants were grouped according to postnatal
age:  less  than 5, greater than or equal to 5 to less than or equal to 13, and
greater  than  13  to less than or equal to 26 weeks. In each age group results
were  compared as follows: C vs. SS, C vs. NM, and SS vs. NM for each parameter
studied.  Before 5 weeks and after 13 weeks there was no significant difference
between  C  and SS, C and NM, and SS and NM in DPSG and NPSG for all categories
of  central,  mixed and obstructive apnea as well as the percentage of periodic
breathing in different sleep states and over TRT. Similar results were obtained
in CPG for all categories of central apnea and percentage of periodic breathing
over TRT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

  Twenty-four-hour  tape recordings of ECG and breathing movements from 16 term
infants (greater than or equal to 37 weeks' gestation) who subsequently died of
sudden  infant  death  syndrome  (SIDS)  were  compared  with  recordings  from
surviving   infants  from  the  same  populations.  Apneic  pauses  of  varying
durations, periodic and regular breathing patterns, heart and respiratory rates
during  regular  breathing were measured. Only one of 16 full-term infants with
SIDS  had  findings outside the range of age-matched control infants (an excess
of  periodic  breathing patterns and an absence of regular breathing). When the
first  recordings  of  each  of  infants  who  died of SIDS, except one who had
cyanotic episodes prior to death, were compared to recordings of survivors (six
for  each  case)  closely  matched  for age, gestation, and weight at birth, no
differences  in breathing patterns or heart or respiratory rates during regular
breathing   could   be   demonstrated.   These   particular   measurements   of
cardiorespiratory  function were, therefore, unable to identify the majority of
full-term infants at risk for SIDS.

  Victims  of  sudden  infant  death  syndrome  (SIDS)  have  occasionally been
reported  to  have had prolonged apnea or an increased frequency of short apnea
prior  to  their  deaths.  To  examine  the  extent  of these abnormalities, we
compared  pneumograms  obtained in 17 infants who subsequently died of SIDS (10
with  history  of  apnea)  with  those of 34 age- and sex-matched controls. The
recordings were analyzed by a computer program that avoided observer bias. SIDS
infants  had  significantly  greater  mean  heart  rate  (P less than 0.05) and
periodic  breathing  during quiet time (P less than 0.003) than control infants
had.  The  apnea  in  SIDS  infants  tended to be more periodic than in control
infants  (P  less  than  0.002).  In addition, the incidence of bradycardia was
greater  in  SIDS  (three  infants) than in controls (none) (P less than 0.03).
These differences suggest a disturbance of autonomic function prior to death in
some victims of SIDS.

  Partial  nasal obstruction was performed during a morning of quiet sleep (QS:
non-REM)  and  active sleep (AS: REM) at ages 1 week, 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6
months  on  12  normal infants, 15 subsequent siblings of victims of the Sudden
Infant  Death  Syndrome  (SIDS)  and  12  infants admitted for investigation of
infant  apnoea  ('near-miss'  SIDS). In all three groups the numbers failing to
arouse after 240 s (FTA-240) in QS were significantly greater than those in AS.
After 2 months of age all groups showed a decrease in the number FTA-240 in AS,
whereas  in  QS the number did not change significantly. Subsequent siblings of
SIDS  had  a significantly higher number FTA-240 in QS than controls. There was
no significant difference in FTA-240 in QS between controls and infant apnoeas,
although there was a trend for this to be higher in subsequent siblings of SIDS
than  infant apnoeas. It was concluded that arousal from AS is more marked than
from  QS,  that  after 2 months of age the ability to arouse from AS increases,
and that in relation to SIDS, QS is the sleep state in which the infant is less
able  to  arouse.  Furthermore,  subsequent siblings of SIDS differ from normal
infants in their ability to arouse from QS.

  450  cardio-pneumograms  (CPG)  were performed on two successive nights in 68
controls  and  235 SIDS siblings. The number of respiratory pauses greater than
or  equal  to  5  sec  and greater than or equal to 10 sec (NP) and the time of
periodic   breathing  (PB)  were  calculated  per  100  minutes  of  recording.
Recordings  were  arranged  into five age groups corresponding to the 1st, 2nd,
3rd,  4th  and  5th-6th  month of life. No significant differences in NP and PB
were found when controls and SIDS siblings were compared separately within each
age  group,  neither as a function of gestational age (less than 40 weeks GA vs
greater  than or equal to 40 weeks GA), nor as a function of the results of the
1st vs the 2nd night of recording. Nor was any significant difference in NP and
PB found when comparing control vs sibling babies within each age group for the
1st  or  for  the  2nd  night  of  recording.  In  SIDS  siblings,  there was a
significant decrease in the three variables studied between the 1st and the 2nd
month  of life. No significant decrease was found in controls. We conclude that
SIDS  siblings are not different from controls of the same age when respiratory
variables are studied by CPG recordings.

  Cardiac,  respiratory  and  neurologic  abnormalities have been identified as
causes  of  Sudden  Infant  Death  Syndrome (SIDS). Recurrent central apnea (no
respiratory  effort  or  nasal/oral airflow) and obstructive apnea (respiratory
effort  without  concurrent  nasal/oral airflow) in infants are considered risk
factors  for  SIDS.  However,  using currently available monitoring techniques,
normal activities such as yawns, stretches and swallows cannot be distinquished
from  short obstructive episodes lasting less than 20 s. A system was developed
to  more  accurately  detect  obstructive  apnea  in  infants using a miniature
microphone  placed  over  the  trachea,  a cassette tape recorder and a MINC-11
microcomputer.  Respiratory  sounds  were recorded on 5 anesthesized rabbits in
which  partial  and  total  airway obstruction was artificially induced. Sounds
were  analyzed by computer using fast Fourier transformations. Amplitude versus
frequency  was  plotted  for  normal  breathing,  partial obstruction and total
obstruction.   Characteristic   patterns   were  identified  for  each  episode
demonstrating   that   acoustic   detection   of   apnea   in   infants   by  a
microprocessor-based monitor is feasible.

  6  infants  (index cases) from five different families had a near-miss sudden
infant   death   syndrome  event  between  3  and  12  weeks  of  age  and  had
polygraphically  documented  apnoeas during sleep. 4 of their siblings had died
of  SIDS.  The  index  cases,  their  4  living  siblings,  10  parents,  and 8
grandparents  underwent  respiratory studies during sleep. All the adults and 3
index   cases   had  cephalometric  X-rays.  2  index  cases  underwent  volume
computerised  tomographic  scans  when  awake and during sleep. Index cases had
mixed  and  obstructive  sleep  apnoea.  Several family members had obstructive
sleep   apnoea;   cephalometric   X-rays   also  showed  small  upper  airways,
particularly  behind  the  base  of the tongue. A small posterior airway at the
level of the tongue may be a familial risk factor for apnoea of infancy.

  Developmental  sleep  patterns  were  compared  in  infants at known risk for
"near-miss"  sudden  infant  death  syndrome  and  age-matched  normal infants.
Near-miss  SIDS  infants  had significant differences suggestive of a temporary
developmental  delay.  They retained rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at neonatal
proportions,  and  stage  2  non-REM  sleep  appeared  later.  They  also had a
significantly  increased  apnea index. Twenty-four-hour recordings of sled
respiratory patterns in near-miss SIDS infants from 3 weeks through 6 months of
age showed a significant reduction in number of body movements in REM, non-REM,
and  total  sleep  time and in percentage of movement time at 3 weeks through 3
months  of  age.  These  findings  can  be  used to address the role of arousal
threshold in infants at risk for SIDS.

  To evaluate the effects of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) immunization on
the  ventilatory  pattern  during sleep in infants at increased risk for sudden
infant death syndrome (SIDS), we performed overnight pneumograms (recordings of
ventilatory  pattern  and  electrocardiogram) on 30 control infants, 46 infants
with  unexplained  apnea,  and 33 subsequent siblings of SIDS victims the night
before and the night following a DTP immunization. Pneumograms were quantitated
for  total  sleep  time,  longest  apnea (in seconds), total duration of apneas
longer  than  6  s  (in  minutes),  and  total periodic breathing (in minutes).
Following the DTP immunization there was no significant change in any criterion
quantitated  on  pneumograms  from  any group except for a decrease in periodic
breathing  in  the  unexplained  apnea group. We conclude that DTP immunization
does  not  increase abnormalities of the ventilatory pattern as recorded by the
pneumogram technique in infants at increased risk for SIDS.

  A  6-week-old  male  infant was admitted for near-miss SIDS documented in the
hospital.  The  episodes  were  subsequently  found to be factitious apnea that
occurred  as a result of the father suffocating the child. Apnea monitoring did
not prevent, and in fact perpetrated the illusion of SIDS in this infant.

  By means of polygraphic sleep recording, the sleep apnea profile with respect
to  the  number and duration of inactive, obstructive and mixed apneic episodes
as  well as periodic breathing has been investigated in infants born preterm at
40,  52  and 64 weeks conceptional age and compared to that of term infants. At
40 weeks preterm infants showed significantly more apnea and periodic breathing
compared to term infants. The difference was essentially due to obstructive and
mixed  apnea  in  non-REM  sleep.  There  was  a  sharp  decrease in all apneic
variables--inactive,  obstructive  and  mixed  apnea  as  well  as  of periodic
breathing--at  52  weeks  conceptional  age  in  infants  that  were previously
preterm.  Both  groups  exhibited  a rather identical sleep apnea profile at 64
weeks. Two prospectively studied infants in the preterm group later became SIDS
victims.  One  of them might have been identified as being at risk on the basis
of his apnea profile compared to the normative data now available.

  Sudden  infant death syndrome (SIDS) probably represents a number of specific
processes  rather  than  one  disease,  the  causes of which have so far eluded
scientists. Various hypotheses as to cause are discussed, as is the role of the
emergency  physician.  Also  considered  are apparently life-threatening events
such  as  prolonged  sleep  apnea,  laryngeal-induced  apnea,  gastroesophageal
reflux-induced apnea, and seizure-associated apnea.  (80 Refs.)

  Apnea of infancy and obstructive sleep apnea in older children are being more
widely  recognized  as potential causes of morbidity and mortality in children.
Much  controversy  exists  surrounding  the relationship of apnea of infancy to
SIDS  and  the  treatment  of  apnea  in infancy, particularly home monitoring.
Obstructive  sleep  apnea  in  older  children  is somewhat better defined, and
therapy is generally more definitive.

  This  study  evaluates  the  effectiveness  and  social  implications of home
monitoring  of  31  infants  at  risk  of  sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
Thirteen  siblings  of  children dying of SIDS, nine near miss SIDS infants and
nine preterm infants with apnoea persisting beyond 40 weeks post conceptual age
were  monitored  from  a  mean  age  of  15  days to a mean of 10 months. Chest
movement  detection monitors were used in 27 and thoracic impedance monitors in
four.  Genuine  apnoeic  episodes  were reported by 21 families, and 13 infants
required  resuscitation.  Apnoeic episodes occurred in all nine preterm infants
but  in only five (38%) of the siblings of SIDS (P less than 0.05). Troublesome
false  alarms  were  a major problem occurring with 61% of the infants and were
more  common  with  the  preterm infants than the siblings of SIDS. All but two
couples stated that the monitor decreased anxiety and improved their quality of
life. Most parents accepted that the social restrictions imposed by the monitor
were  part  of the caring process but four couples were highly resentful of the
changes  imposed on their lifestyle. The monitors used were far from ideal with
malfunction  occurring  in  17, necessitating replacement in six, repair in six
and cessation of monitoring in three. The parents became ingenious in modifying
the  monitors  to  their own individual requirements. Although none of these 31
'at  risk'  infants died the study sample was far too small to conclude whether
home monitoring prevented any cases of SIDS.

  Knowledge  regarding  the  etiology and optimal management of prolonged apnea
and  its  relationship  to  SIDS is still limited. The majority of infants with
prolonged  apnea do not die of SIDS, although the risk of SIDS in this group is
greater  than  in the general population. Many infants with prolonged apnea who
are  perceived  by  parents  and  physicians as having had a "life-threatening"
event  may  be at risk for another. Appropriate assessment following this event
includes  a  careful  history  and  physical examination to determine cause and
severity.   Etiologies   to   be   considered   include  infections,  metabolic
aberrations, seizure problems, cardiac arrhythmias or congenital heart disease,
anatomic  airway abnormalities, gastroesophageal reflux and impaired regulation
of  breathing.  If a specific cause has been identified for the infant's apnea,
appropriate  treatment often will lead to resolution of the apnea problem. If a
specific  etiology has not been identified or if the risk of "life-threatening"
prolonged  apnea  seems to persist, electronic cardiorespiratory monitoring may
be  considered.  Appropriate  treatment  for  asymptomatic  infants  who are at
increased  statistical  risk of SIDS is controversial. Asymptomatic infants may
be  candidates  for home monitoring, but as yet, there are no reliable tests to
predict  which infants are at risk for prolonged apnea. Monitoring at home must
be  prescribed  by the physician and should be continued until judged no longer
appropriate  by  the attending physician. Skilled caregivers are crucial to the
continuous  observation and management of these patients in the hospital and at
home.  Therefore  parents  should  be taught monitor use and also CPR.(ABSTRACT

  Sleep  polygraphic  recording was carried out on 57 normal infants and on 100
SIDS  siblings  during  morning  naps  between birth and the 4th month of life.
Total  sleep time and duration of sleep stages were determined. Central apnoeas
of  2  sec and longer duration were analysed in AS, QS and IS. Apnoea index and
number  of  apnoeas per 100 min of sleep stage were determined. Obstructive and
mixed  apnoeas  were tabulated separately. Percentage of periodic breathing was
also  determined.  Control  babies  and  SIDS  siblings  were compared on these
parameters, using the Mann-Whitney test. Between the 6th and 13th weeks of life
respiratory  pauses  were  significantly more frequent in SIDS siblings than in
control  subjects.  The  difference  disappeared after the 13th week. The roles
that  peripheral afferents and the circadian organization of respiratory pauses
play  in  determining the results are discussed. This technique does not appear
to permit estimation of the risk of subsequent apnoeic episodes.

  The  sudden  infant  death  syndrome  (SIDS) is the leading cause of death of
infants between the end of the first month and the first year of life. The risk
of  SIDS is increased in subsequent siblings of infants with SIDS, infants with
apnea  of  infancy  (AI),  and  prematurely  born infants. The cause of SIDS is
unknown, but much clinical and investigative attention has been directed toward
AI  as  a possible premortem expression of the abnormality that can potentially
cause  SIDS. Both AI and SIDS probably have multiple different mechanisms. Some
infants  with  AI have been shown to have abnormal control of respiration. This
article  is  intended  to summarize the relationship between AI and SIDS and to
review  the  published  physiologic  studies  about AI. I present and discuss a
system for evaluation and "treatment" of patients with AI.  (89 Refs.)

  Forty-five  term  infants  who had a "near miss" for SIDS were studied with a
continuous  overnight  polygraphic recording of endoesophageal pH, respiration,
and  ECG. Recordings were examined for occurrences of GER and for central apnea
of 10 seconds or greater duration. There were 341 apneic events greater than or
equal  to  10 seconds recorded in 46 studies, with a mean of 7 +/- 7. In 91% of
the  infants,  no apneas exceeded 15 seconds. Only 31 episodes of apnea greater
than  or  equal to 10 seconds occurred during GER: in two of these episodes the
apneic  event  was  greater  than or equal to 15 seconds. Twenty-four of the 31
apneas  greater  than  or  equal to 10 seconds during periods of pH less than 4
occurred  in one infant. A total of 356 precipitous pH drops was recorded (mean
8.7  +/-  7.4). The pH drops occurred most frequently when the patient appeared
to  be  awake  (73%), and in 84% of events there was movement before and during
the  pH  change.  We conclude that the majority of these near miss SIDS infants
had  GER  associated  with  movement during awake periods, without any temporal
relationship  to apnea. Although reflex apnea following GER may be seen in some
term infants, this problem may be more significant for the immature infant.

  New  methods  to  separate  artifacts  from  normal  and  defective breathing

  Respiratory  and  cardiac  monitoring  was  undertaken  in the home for seven
months  in  an  infant at increased risk for cot-death (SIDS). The infant was a
surviving  non-identical  twin  of  a  SIDS  sibling. In hospital, clinical and
cardio-respiratory studies during sleep were normal. Analysis of eleven 24-hour
tape-recordings  showed  that  many  of  the  alarms at home were the result of
technical  problems.  Suspected  apnoeas  were  identified  initially  from  an
oscilloscopic  display  of  the original waveforms and from a compressed-record
and   histogram   of   the   computed   breath-to-breath   intervals.  Expanded
pen-recordings confirmed some, but not all, of these suspected apnoeas (greater
than  15s).  The  results  indicate  (i)  the  importance  of verifying apnoeic
episodes;  (ii)  the  value  of  24-h compressed recordings for identifying and
timing  the sleep cycles and their possible relationships to breathing defects;
(iii)  the  need  for  improved instrumentation; (iv) the dangers of evaluating
clinical prognosis or research from parental diaries.

  Twenty-nine  full-term  near miss for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and
30  normal  control  infants  underwent 24-hour polygraphic monitoring. Several
types  of  respiratory events during sleep (eg, central, mixed, and obstructive
apnea,  periodic  breathing)  were  defined  and  tabulated.  Analysis of these
respiratory variables and comparison of groups of near miss and control infants
indicated  that  between  3 weeks and 4 1/2 months of age only one variable was
consistently  different  at  a  statistically  significant level: the number of
mixed  and  obstructive  apnea  greater than 3 seconds during total sleep time.
This  study also showed an increase in mixed and obstructive respiratory events
during sleep at 6 weeks of age in control as well as in near miss infants.

  Electrophysiologic  and cardiorespiratory events were studied polygraphically
and  by  ambulatory  monitoring in 'near miss' for sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS)  and  normal  control  infants  1-4 months old. The data show that 'near
miss'  babies  typically  have many apneic periods in their sleep, particularly
apneas  lasting  10  sec  or longer. These tend to decrease with age. They have
longer  lasting  apneas  than  controls,  although  the latter have respiratory
pauses  lasting less than 10 sec, in particular during rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep.  An  upper  respiratory  infection  (URI) in 'near miss' infants clearly
appears  to be a risk factor which will be studied further both in-hospital and
at home using a monitoring technique with our Medilog ambulatory system.
