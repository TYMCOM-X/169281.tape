DESCRIPTION
     mail is a comfortable,  flexible,  interactive  program  for
     composing, sending and receiving electronic messages.  While
     reading messages, mail provides you with commands to browse,
     display, save, delete, and respond to messages.  While send-
     ing mail, mail allows  editing  and  reviewing  of  messages
     being  composed,  and  the  inclusion  of text from files or
     other messages.

     Incoming mail is stored in the _s_y_s_t_e_m _m_a_i_l_b_o_x for each user.
     This  is  a  file  named  after the user in /var/spool/mail.
     mail normally looks in this file for incoming messages,  but
     you can use the MAIL environment variable to have it look in
     a different file.  When you read a message, it is marked  to
     be  moved  to  a  secondary file for storage. This secondary
     file, called the _m_b_o_x, is normally the  file  mbox  in  your
     home directory. This file can also be changed by setting the
     MBOX environment variable.  Messages remain in the _m_b_o_x file
     until deliberately removed.

OPTIONS
     If no _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t is specified, mail attempts to read messages
     from the system mailbox.

     -d            Turn on debugging  output.  (Neither  particu-
                   larly interesting nor recommended.)

     -e            Test for presence of mail.   If  there  is  no
                   mail,  mail  prints  nothing and exits (with a
                   successful return code).

     -F            Record the message in a file named  after  the
                   first  recipient.   Override  the record vari-
                   able, if set.

     -H            Print header summary only.

     -i            Ignore interrupts (as with  the  ignore  vari-
                   able).

     -v            Pass the -v flag to sendmail(8).

     -f [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e] Read messages from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e instead of  system
                   mailbox.   If  no  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  is specified, the
                   _m_b_o_x is used.

     -f +_f_o_l_d_e_r    Use the file _f_o_l_d_e_r in  the  folder  directory
                   (same  as  the  folder  command).  The name of
                   this directory is listed in the  folder  vari-
                   able.

     -h _n_u_m_b_e_r     The number of  network  "hops"  made  so  far.

                   infinite delivery loops.

     -r _a_d_d_r_e_s_s    Pass _a_d_d_r_e_s_s  to  network  delivery  software.
                   All tilde (~) commands are disabled.

     -s _s_u_b_j_e_c_t    Set the Subject header field to _s_u_b_j_e_c_t.

     -T _f_i_l_e       Print the contents of the _a_r_t_i_c_l_e-_i_d fields of
                   all messages that were read or deleted on _f_i_l_e
                   (for the  use  of  network  news  programs  if
                   available).

     -u _u_s_e_r       Read _u_s_e_r's  system  mailbox.   This  is  only
                   effective if _u_s_e_r's system mailbox is not read
                   protected.

USAGE
     Refer to _G_e_t_t_i_n_g  _S_t_a_r_t_e_d  for  tutorial  information  about
     mail.

  Starting Mail
     As it starts, mail reads commands from  a  system-wide  file
     (/usr/lib/Mail.rc)  to initialize certain variables, then it
     reads from a private start-up file called the  ._m_a_i_l_r_c  file
     (it is normally the file .mailrc in your home directory, but
     can be changed by setting the MAILRC  environment  variable)
     for  your personal commands and variable settings. Most mail
     commands are legal inside start-up files.  The  most  common
     uses for this file are to set up initial display options and
     alias lists.  The following commands are _n_o_t  legal  in  the

     start-up  file:  !,  Copy,  edit,  followup, Followup, hold,
     mail, preserve, reply, Reply, replyall, replysender,  shell,
     and  visual.   Any  errors  in  the  start-up file cause the
     remaining lines in that file to be ignored.

     You can use the mail command to send a message  directly  by
     including  names  of  recipients as arguments on the command
     line.  When no recipients appear on the mail  command  line,
     it  enters  command  mode,  from which you can read messages
     sent to you.  If you list no recipients  and  have  no  mes-
     sages,  mail  prints the message: `No mail for _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e' and
     exits.

     When in command mode (while reading messages), you can  send
     messages using the mail command.

  Sending Mail
     While you are composing a message to send, mail is in  _i_n_p_u_t
     mode.  If no subject is specified as an argument to the com-
     mand a prompt for the subject is printed. After entering the
     subject  line,  mail enters _i_n_p_u_t mode to accept the text of
     your message to send.

     As you type in the message, mail stores it  in  a  temporary
     file.   To review or modify the message, enter the appropri-
     ate _t_i_l_d_e _e_s_c_a_p_e_s, listed below,  at  the  beginning  of  an
     input line.

     To indicate that the message is ready to send,  type  a  dot
     (or  EOF  character,  normally CTRL-D ) on a line by itself.
     mail submits the message to sendmail(8) for routing to  each
     _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t.

     Recipients can be;

     o+    local usernames

     o+    Internet addresses of the form:

               _n_a_m_e@_d_o_m_a_i_n

     o+    uucp(1C) addresses of the form:

     o+    filenames for which you have write permission

     o+    alias groups

     If the name of the _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t begins with a pipe symbol  (|),
     the  remainder  of  the  name is taken as a shell command to
     pipe  the  message  through.   This  provides  an  automatic

     interface  with  any  program that reads the standard input,
     such as lpr(1) to record outgoing mail on paper.   An  alias
     group is the name of a list of recipients that is set by the
     alias command, taken from the host's /etc/aliases  file,  or
     taken  from  the  Network  Information Service (NIS) aliases
     domain.  See aliases(5)  for  more  information  about  mail
     addresses and aliases.

  Tilde Escapes
     The following _t_i_l_d_e _e_s_c_a_p_e commands can be used when compos-
     ing  messages  to send. Each must appear at the beginning of
     an input line.  The escape character (~), can be changed  by
     setting  a  new  value  for the escape variable.  The escape
     character can be entered as text by typing it twice.

     ~! [_s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
          Escape to the shell.  If present, run _s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

     ~.   Simulate EOF (terminate message input).

     ~: _m_a_i_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     ~_ _m_a_i_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d

     ~A   Insert the autograph string Sign into the message.

     ~a   Insert the autograph string sign into the message.

     ~b _n_a_m_e ...
          Add the _n_a_m_es to the  blind  carbon  copy  (Bcc)  list.
          This is like the carbon copy (Cc) list, except that the
          names in the Bcc list are not shown in  the  header  of
          the mail message.

     ~c _n_a_m_e ...
          Add the _n_a_m_es to the carbon copy (Cc) list.

     ~d   Read in the _d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r file.  The name of this file is
          listed in the variable DEAD.

     ~e   Invoke the editor to edit the message. The name of  the
          editor  is  listed in the EDITOR variable.  The default
          editor is ex(1).

     ~f [_m_e_s_s_a_g_e-_l_i_s_t]
          Forward the listed messages,  or  the  current  message
          being  read.   Valid  only when sending a message while
          reading mail; the messages are inserted without altera-
          tion (as opposed to the ~m escape).

          message while reading mail; the  text  the  message  is
          shifted  to  the right, and the string contained in the
          indentprefix variable is inserted as the leftmost char-
          acters of each line.  If indentprefix is not set, a TAB
          character is inserted into each line.

     ~p   Print the message being entered.

     ~q   Quit from input mode by simulating  an  interrupt.   If
          the  body of the message is not empty, the partial mes-
          sage is saved in the _d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r file.

  Reading Mail
     When you enter _c_o_m_m_a_n_d mode in order to read your  messages,
     mail  displays  a  header  summary of the first several mes-
     sages, followed by a prompt for one of the  commands  listed
     below.  The default prompt is the & (ampersand character).

     Message are listed and referred to by number.  There is,  at
     any  time,  a current message, which is marked by a > in the
     header summary. For commands that take an optional  list  of
     messages,  if  you omit a message number as an argument, the
     command applies to the current message.

     A  _m_e_s_s_a_g_e-_l_i_s_t  is  a  list  of   message   specifications,
     separated by SPACE characters, which may include:

          .    The current message.
          _n    Message number _n.
          ^    The first undeleted message.
          $    The last message.
          +    The next undeleted message.
          -    The previous undeleted message.
          *    All messages.
          _n-_m  An inclusive range of message numbers.
          _u_s_e_r All messages from _u_s_e_r.
          /_s_t_r_i_n_g
               All messages with _s_t_r_i_n_g in the subject line (case
               ignored).
          :_c   All messages of type _c, where _c is one of:

                    d    deleted messages
                    n    new messages
                    o    old messages
                    r    read messages
                    u    unread messages
               Note:  the  context  of  the  command   determines
               whether  this  type of message specification makes
               sense.

     Additional arguments are  treated  as  strings  whose  usage
     depends on the command involved.  Filenames, where expected,
     are expanded using the  normal  shell  filename-substitution
     mechanism.

     Special characters,  recognized  by  certain  commands,  are
     documented with those commands.

  Commands
     While in command mode, if you type in an empty command  line
     (a  RETURN  or  NEWLINE only), the print command is assumed.
     The following is a complete list of mail commands:

     ! _s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d   Escape to the  shell.   The  name  of  the

  Forwarding Messages
     To forward a specific message, include it in  a  message  to
     the  desired  recipients with the ~f or ~m tilde escapes. To
     forward mail automatically, add a  comma-separated  list  of
     addresses  for additional recipients to the .forward file in
     your home directory.  This is different from the  format  of
     the  alias  command,  which  takes  a  space-separated  list
     instead.  Note:  forwarding  addresses  must  be  valid  (as
     described  in  aliases(5)),  or  the messages will "bounce."
     You cannot, for instance, reroute your mail to a new host by
     forwarding it to your new address if it is not yet listed in
     the NIS aliases domain.

  Variables
     The behavior of mail is governed  by  a  set  of  predefined
     variables  that  are set and cleared using the set and unset
     commands.

  _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s
     Values for the following variables are read in automatically
     from  the  environment;  they  cannot be altered from within
     mail:

     HOME=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                   The user's home directory.

     MAIL=_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
                   The name of the initial mailbox file  to  read
                   (in lieu of the standard system mailbox).  The
                   default is /var/spool/mail/_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e.

     MAILRC=_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
                   The name of the personal start-up  file.   The
                   default is $HOME/.mailrc.

  _M_a_i_l _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s
     The  following  variables  can  be  initialized  within  the
     ._m_a_i_l_r_c file, or set and altered interactively using the set
     command. They can also be imported from the environment  (in
     which case their values cannot be changed within mail).  The
     unset command clears variables. The set command can also  be
     used  to  clear  a  variable by prefixing the word no to the
     name of the variable to clear.

     Variables for which values are normally supplied  are  indi-
     cated with an equal-sign (=).  The equal-sign is required by
     the set command, and there can  be  no  spaces  between  the
     variable-name,  equal-sign, and value, using set to assign a
     value.

     allnet        All network names whose last component  (login
                   name)  match  are  treated as identical.  This
                   causes  the  message  list  specifications  to
                   behave  similarly.   Default is noallnet.  See
                   also the  alternates  command  and  the  metoo
                   variable.

     alwaysignore  Ignore header fields with  ignore  everywhere,
                   not  just  during  print or type.  Affects the
                   save, Save, copy, Copy, top, pipe,  and  write
                   commands, and the ~m and ~f tilde escapes.

     append        Upon termination, append messages to  the  end
                   of  the  _m_b_o_x file instead of prepending them.
                   Default is noappend but append is set  in  the
                   global  start-up file (which can be suppressed
                   with the -n command line option).

     askcc         Prompt  for  the  Cc  list  after  message  is
                   entered.  Default is noaskcc.

     asksub        Prompt for subject if it is not  specified  on
                   the  command line with the -s option.  Enabled
                   by default.

     autoprint     Enable automatic printing  of  messages  after
                   delete  and  undelete  commands.   Default  is
                   noautoprint.

     EDITOR=_s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   The command to run when the edit or ~e command
                   is used.  Default is ex(1).

     escape=_c      Substitute _c for the ~ escape character.

     folder=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                   The directory for saving standard mail  files.
                   User  specified  file  names  beginning with a
                   plus  (+)  are  expanded  by   preceding   the
                   filename  with  this  directory name to obtain
                   the real  filename.   If  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  does  not
                   start  with  a slash (/), the value of HOME is
                   prepended to it.  There is no default for  the
                   folder variable.  See also outfolder below.

     header        Enable printing of  the  header  summary  when
                   entering mail.  Enabled by default.

     hold          Preserve all messages that  are  read  in  the
                   system  mailbox instead of putting them in the
                   standard _m_b_o_x save file.   Default  is  nohold
                   for mail and hold for mailtool(1).

     ignore        Ignore  interrupts  while  entering  messages.
                   Handy  for  noisy  dial-up  lines.  Default is
                   noignore.

     ignoreeof     Ignore EOF during message input.   Input  must
                   be  terminated  by a period (`.') on a line by
                   itself or by the  `~.'  command.   Default  is
                   noignoreeof.  See also dot above.

     indentprefix=_s_t_r_i_n_g
                   When indentprefix is set, _s_t_r_i_n_g  is  used  to
                   mark  indented  lines  from  messages included
                   with ~m.  The default is a TAB character.

     keep          When the system mailbox is empty, truncate  it
                   to  zero  length instead of removing it.  Dis-
                   abled by default.

     keepsave      Keep messages that have been  saved  in  other
                   files  in the system mailbox instead of delet-
                   ing them.  Default is nokeepsave.

     LISTER=_s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   The command (and options) to use when  listing
                   the   files  in  the  folder  directory.   The
                   default is ls(1V).

MAIL(1)                  USER COMMANDS                    MAIL(1)



     MBOX=_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
                   The name of the file to  save  messages  which
                   have  been  read.   The  xit command overrides
                   this variable,  as  does  saving  the  message
                   explicitly  to  another  file.  Default is the
                   file mbox in your home directory.

     metoo         If your login appears as a recipient,  do  not
                   delete it from the list.  Default is nometoo.

     no            When used as a prefix to a variable name,  has
                   the effect of unsetting the variable.

     onehop        When responding to a message that  was  origi-
                   nally  sent  to  several recipients, the other
                   recipient addresses are normally forced to  be
                   relative  to  the originating author's machine
                   for the response.  This flag disables  altera-
                   tion  of  the recipients' addresses, improving
                   efficiency in a network where all machines can
                   send  directly to all other machines (that is,
                   one "hop" away).

     outfolder     Locate the files used to record outgoing  mes-
                   sages in the directory specified by the folder
                   variable  unless  the  pathname  is  absolute.
                   Default  is nooutfolder.  See folder above and
                   the Save, Copy, followup,  and  Followup  com-
                   mands.

     page          Used with the pipe command to  insert  a  form
                   feed after each message sent through the pipe.
                   Default is nopage.

     PAGER=_s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   The command to use as a filter for  paginating
                   output,  along  with  any  options to be used.
                   Default is more(1).

     prompt=_s_t_r_i_n_g Set  the  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  _m_o_d_e  prompt   to   _s_t_r_i_n_g.
                   Default is `&'.

     quiet         Refrain from printing the opening message  and
                   version   when   entering  mail.   Default  is
                   noquiet.

     record=_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
                   Record all outgoing mail  in  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.   Dis-
                   abled  by default.  See also the variable out-
                   folder.

     replyall      Reverse the effect  of  the  reply  and  Reply

MAIL(1)                  USER COMMANDS                    MAIL(1)



                   commands.

     save          Enable saving of messages in  the  _d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r
                   file on interrupt or delivery error.  See DEAD
                   for a description of this  file.   Enabled  by
                   default.

     screen=_n_u_m_b_e_r Set the number of lines in  a  screen-full  of
                   headers for the headers command.

     sendmail=_s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   Alternate  command  for  delivering  messages.
                   Note:  in  addition  to  the  expected list of
                   recipients, mail also passes the  -i  and  -m,
                   flags  to  the command.  Since these flags are
                   not appropriate to  other  commands,  you  may
                   have  to  use  a shell script that strips them
                   from the arguments list  before  invoking  the
                   desired command.

     sendwait      Wait for background mailer  to  finish  before
                   returning.  Default is nosendwait.

     SHELL=_s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   The name of a preferred  command  interpreter.
                   Typically  inherited from the environment, the
                   shell is normally  the  one  you  always  use.
                   Otherwise defaults to sh(1).

     showto        When displaying the  header  summary  and  the
                   message  is  from  you,  print the recipient's
                   name instead of the author's name.

     sign=_a_u_t_o_g_r_a_p_h
                   The _a_u_t_o_g_r_a_p_h text inserted into  the  message
                   when  the ~a (autograph) command is given.  No
                   default (see also the ~i tilde escape).

     Sign=_a_u_t_o_g_r_a_p_h
                   The _a_u_t_o_g_r_a_p_h text inserted into  the  message
                   when the ~A command is given.  No default (see
                   also the ~i tilde escape).

     toplines=_n_u_m_b_e_r
                   The number of lines of header  to  print  with
                   the top command.  Default is 5.

     verbose       Invoke sendmail with the -v flag.

     VISUAL=_s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   The  name  of  a  preferred   screen   editor.

     mail is found in /usr/ucb/Mail, as a link to  /usr/ucb/mail.
     If  you  wish to use the original (version 7) UNIX mail pro-
     gram, you can find it in /usr/bin/mail.   Its  man  page  is
     named bin-mail(1).

BUGS
     Where _s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is shown as  valid,  arguments  are  not
     always allowed.  Experimentation is recommended.

     Internal variables imported from the  execution  environment
     cannot be unset.

     Replies do not always  generate  correct  return  addresses.
     Try resending the errant reply with onehop set.

     mail does not lock your record  file.   So,  if  you  use  a
     record  file  and  send two or more messages simultaneously,
     lines from the messages may be  interleaved  in  the  record
     file.

     The format for the alias command is a  space-separated  list
     of  recipients,  while the format for an alias in either the
     .forward or /etc/aliases is a comma-separated list.

NOTES
     The Network Information Service (NIS) was formerly known  as
     Sun  Yellow Pages (YP). The functionality of the two remains
     the same; only the name has changed.
