******************************** NOTE *************************************
THERE ARE SOME MAJOR CHANGES TO THIS UPDATE OF THE KLAD10 PROCESS.
THE TAPES NOW ONLY INCLUDE TWO (2) SAVESETS.  THE FIRST CONTAINS THE
[1,*],[2,5],[5,11],[6,*](NOT INCLUDING THE [6,11]), AND [35,1414] AREAS.
THE SECOND CONTAINS THE [10,*] AREAS.  WHEN YOU BUILD THE KLAD10 PACK,
YOU RESTORE THE FIRST SAVE SET, THEN YOU BUILD THE [6,11] AREA.
NEXT YOU CONNECT BACK TO THE [6,10] AREA & DELETE ALL OF THE UNUSED
HARDWARE ISOLATION & SUPPORT FILES (I.E. .A11 & .TIC) FILES FROM THE
[6,10] AREA IF YOU HAVE A RP04. THEN YOU CONNECT BACK TO THE [1,2]
AREA & FINISH RESTORING THE [10,*] AREA.

SECTION B1: STAND-ALONE DIAGNOSTIC USAGE WITH KLDCP (VERSION 17 OR LATER)
            ---------------------------------------

        USING THE LATEST DECTAPE BASED RELEASE OF KLDCP YOU CAN RUN ALL
        DIAGNOSTICS IN NORMAL MANNER (PACK MODIFYING DIAGNOSTICS
        EXCLUDED)

        1. MOUNT KLDCP DECTAPE AND START IT AND MOUNT KLAD-10
           ON A DUAL-PORTED DRIVE 0 WRITE-PROTECTED.

        2. TYPE 'B' TO START 20 MIN SHORT CHECKOUT.

        -------------------------------------------------
        PREFERRED METHOD FOR BOOTING KLDCP IN THE SYSTEM!
        -------------------------------------------------

        THE PROCEDURE INVOLVES RSX-20, A SPECIAL RSX-PROGRAM "BOO"
        AND ANOTHER SPECIAL "DBOOT"

        EXAMPLE:
        YOU HAVE KLAD-10 ON UNIT 0 IN A/B MODE WRITE-ENABLED.
        SET SWITCHES ON 11 TO (OCTAL) 203.
        PRESS "ENABLE" AND "SW REG" AT THE SAME TIME.
                --  THIS WILL LOAD RSX-20,
                RSX-20F VA14-45 13:04 13-NOV-81

                [SY0: REDIRECTED TO DB0:]
                [DB0: MOUNTED]

        PRESS "CONTROL \". THIS SHOULD GET YOU THE PAR%

        IF YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS PRINTED:

        INS -- I/O ERROR ON TASK  FILE TSK=PARSER PAR=GEN

        YOU MAY HAVE THE DRIVE WRITE LOCKED.
                        NOTE:                                           PAGE 4
                        -----
        IF YOU SEE "PAR>", YOU HAVE NOT STOPPED THE KL FROM RUNNING.
        YOU HAVE TO TYPE  "ABORT" TO THE PARSER. YOU SHOULD THEN
        GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

                PAR%

        TYPE "MCR BOO" TO THE PARSER, WHICH WILL COME BACK WITH
        BOO>

        TYPE "DBOOT" TO BOO>, WHICH WILL COME BACK WITH KLDCP.

        NOW PLEASE WRITE LOCK THE DRIVE.
        --------------------------------

        ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW IS TO TYPE IN "B" <CR>.
        THIS WILL RUN THE FRONT-END DIAGNOSTICS FOR YOU.


        TO LOAD THE 701 MONITOR
        ------------------------

        WRITE ENABLE ALL DRIVES
        PUT 207 IN THE SWITCHES ON THE 11 FRONT-END
        PRESS ENABLE SWITCH ON THE KL10
        AND PUSH SW/REG LOAD
        THE SYSTEM WILL BOOT UP WITH KLI

APPENDIX A.     UPDATE (PATCHING) TECHNIQUE FOR .A11 FILES              PAGE 5
                ------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:
---------
        ALL MAJOR DIAGNOSTIC FILES ON KLAD-10 ARE PATCHABLE (ALL *.A10 AND ALL
        *.A11 FILES, *.BIC AND *.BIN FILES CAN ONLY BE PATCHED VIA UPD2 ON
        FLOPPIES).

        THE PATCHING FOLLOWS 3 MAJOR STEPS:

        1. GET THE FILE TO BE PATCHED INTO A WORK-AREA AND FIND OUT, WHERE
           IT IS KEPT ON KLAD-10.

        2. PUT THE FILE BACK INTO THE AREA(S) IT IS KEPT ON KLAD-10.

        3. UPDATE THE FILE <F-S>KLAD.UPD TO KEEP TAB ON CHANGES MADE TO
           THIS KLAD-10.

        TO MINIMEZE THE WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT "SAVE"-FORMATS CREATED
        ON THE 10/20 BY OUR ASSEMBLERS/LOADERS (MACRO/LINK MACY11, PAL10
        ETC) THE "ASCIIZED" FORMAT WAS INVENTED. CONVRT ALLOWS YOU TO
        "ASCIIZE" THE OUTPUT FILES OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED ASSEMBLER/LOADERS
        AND CROSS-ASSEMBLERS.

        BASICALLY AN *.A11 FILE CONSISTS OF LOAD-LINES AND A TRANSFER-
        LINE.

        CONVRT TRANSLATES 6-BIT OCTAL VALUES INTO 7-BIT ASCII, STARTING WITH
        THE LEAST SIGNIFICANT BITS. PDP11 WORDS ARE THEREFORE REPRESENTED BY 3
        ASCII CHARACTERS (6+6+2=16) THIS IS THE BASIC STORAGE UNIT IN ASCIIZED
        FILES. PDP10 WORDS ARE TRANSLATED INTO THREE UNITS (16+16+4=36)

        6-BIT VALUES BETWEEN 0 AND 74 ARE TRANSLATED INTO 100 TO 174, VALUES
        75 TO 77 ARE LEFT UNCHANGED.

        THE GENERAL LINE FORMAT IS:
                M   T  C , A , W1 , W2 ,...S <CARRIAGE RETURN>

        M = E - PDP11 FILE, T - PDP10 FILE, ; - COMMENT LINE (TITLE)

        T = "SPACE" - ASCIIZED LINE, O - OCTAL PATCHING LINE

        C = COUNT OF CONCURRENT WORD-UNITS (TIMES 3 FOR PDP10 WORDS)

        A = ADDRESS OF FIRST OF THE C CONCURRENT WORDS

        WX = CONTENTS OF WORDS

        S = CHECKSUM-WORD (SUM OF A AND ALL W'S PLUS S GIVES 16-BIT ZEROES)

        SPECIAL CONDITIONS:                                             PAGE 6
        -------------------

        1. IF TYPE-FIELD IS O (OCTAL), THE ADDRESS AND WORD FIELDS ARE TRANS-
           LATED FROM 6 OCTAL NUMBERS INSTEAD OF FROM 3 ASCIIZED CHARACTERS
           AND NO CHECKSUM IS EXPECTED.
        2. IF THE COUNT-FIELD IS LEFT OUT, THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS-FIELD IS
           TAKEN AS THE "START-ADDRESS" OF THE PROGRAM---TRANSFER-LINE AND
           END OF FILE IS ASSUMED.

THE BASIC EDITING SEQUENCE THEREFORE BREAKS DOWN TO:

        1. SEARCH FOR TRANSFER-LINE AND INSERT LOAD-LINE IN FRONT OF IT.

EXAMPLE (PDP11-DIAGNOSTIC-A11 FILES; 1 WORD PATCH)
        17000/107

        LOAD-LINE HAS 1 WORD AND LOOKS LIKE

        EO1,17000,107

EXAMPLE (A11-FILES 2 WORD PATCH)
        17002/107
        17004/110

        LOAD-LINE WILL LOOK LIKE

        EO2,17002,107,110

        THIS IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE:
        ------------------------

        PUT YOUR KLAD PACK ON UNIT 0, PUT ALL THE SWITCHES ON THE 11 FRONT-
        END TO 0, THEN PUT ENABLE SWITCH ON AND PRESS DISK LOAD SWITCH.
        THIS WILL GIVE YOU RSX, LOAD MICROCODE, CONFIGURE MEMORY AND LOAD
        BOOT.
