Notes:
 
1)Tech Support Standby as I have been informed is not for first line calls
ans is supposed to used after the local CE has used all his talents and
has a need for assistance.I have no problem in helping an idividual who
is working on a problem but calling T.S. for remote diagnostic support
from a CE's home is abusing Tech Support.
 
2)The Remote Diagnostic Center in St.Louis is only open from 8 to 5
weekdays CDT and has no operations at other times.The sites using the
RDC only has this type of support during these hours and are on there
own at other times,a CE is expected to be on site when the RDC is
accessing the problem site.....Quote Tom Ellis
 
3)The time from customer call-in to CHAD and response to the site is
at best horrible,if the local standby person is not capable or willing
to handle a call or at least do what Tech Support has requested then
another stand-by person should be assigned.The local CE should be on-site
prior to calling TS at all times to facilitate the repair of the system.
The lack of training is a local problem and does not constitute escalation
to Tech Support.This problem was only repaired because we in Tech Support
realize that the CUSTOMER IS FIRST and that internal deficiancies have to
be resolved later.
 
4)The site spares are at be poor,this site does not have all needed spares
for the 11/44 RH-11 or other required parts.This situation needs attention
ASAP
