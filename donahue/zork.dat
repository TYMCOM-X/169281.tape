1,**** RANDOM MESSAGES ****     FREE: 99,366
1,Welcome to Dungeon.             This version created long, long ago.
2,Done.
3,Revision history:
3,
3,V1.0          Appeared fully-formed in someone's VM reader.
4,Useful commands:
4,
4,   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
4,for rooms which have been visited.  The 'UNBRIEF' command turns this
4,off.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room
4,descriptions for all rooms.  'UNSUPER' turns this off.
4,   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
4,of what the game is about.
4,   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
4,to continue playing.
4,   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
4,   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
4,   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
4,   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
4,   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
4,   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
4,   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
4,
4,Containment:
4,
4,   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
4,be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
4,not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
4,which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
4,to see such an object, the container must be either open or
4,transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
4,the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
4,sizes.  You may PUT any object you have access to (it need not be
4,in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
4,will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
4,proccess may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
4,can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
4,one level down.
4,
4,Fighting:
4,
4,   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
4,attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
4,Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
4,etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
4,fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
4,getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
4,Your carrying capacity may also be reduced after a fight.
4,Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
4,fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
4,should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
4,
4,Command parser:
4
4,   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
4,For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
4,first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
4,'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
4,creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
4,tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
4,
4,   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
4,the following types of things--
4,
4,   Actions:
4,      Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
4,      Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
4,      PUT DOWN, etc.
4,
4,   Directions:
4,      NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
4,      Other more obscure directions (LAND, CLIMB) are appropriate in
4,      only certain situations.
4,
4,   Objects:
4,      Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
4,
4,   Adjectives:
4,      Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
4,      two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
4,      DOORs, BUTTONs).
4,
4,   Prepositions:
4,      It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
4,      the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
4,      without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
4,      CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
4,      When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
4,      WITH DEMON' won't parse.
4,
4,   Sentences:
4,      The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-
4,      tions.  Rather than listing them, we advise you to do reasonable
4,      things.
4,
4,   Ambiguity:
4,      The parser tries to be clever about what do do in the case of
4,      actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
4,      If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
4,      that is should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
4,      Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
5,Welcome to Dungeon!
5,
5,   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
5,quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
5,In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
5,receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
5,room in the living room of the house.
5,
5,   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
5,which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
5,need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
5,since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
5,material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
5,is rumored to be useful.
5,
5,   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
5,When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
5,certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
5,the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
5,safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
5,addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
5,with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
5,which you may do only twice.
5,
5,   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
5,likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
5,light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
5,rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
5,you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
5,he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
5,his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-
5,ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
5,through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
6,Please answer the question.
7,You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
7,dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
7,installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
7,may gloat over them.
8,What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
8,shared-resources 168MP system and it survived for over thirty seconds.
8,Oh, well.
9,Now let me see...
9,Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
9,everything.
10,Do you wish me to try to patch you?
11,You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
11,there is a window which is #.
12,open
13,slightly ajar
14,You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
14,been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
14,the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
14,east is a small window which is #.
15,You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west is
15,a door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be nailed shut.
16,You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
16,is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
16,strange gothic lettering.
17,In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
18,In the center of the room is a closed trap door.
19,In the center of the room is an open trap door.
20,There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.
21,You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
21,east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
21,steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
22,The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
23,You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
23,passages in the immediate vicinity.
24,Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.
25,Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.
26,Above you is a grating.
27,You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west
27,and south.
28,There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.
29,There is an open grating descending into darkness.
30,A grating appears on the ground.
31,You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
32,You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
32,reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
32,a wide stream running through the center of the room.
33,There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
33,climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
34,You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
34,Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
34,cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.
35,You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
35,large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
36,You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.
37,You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
37,a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
37,a wide stream running through the center of the room.
38,There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
39,You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
39,and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.
40,Part of the glacier has been melted.
41,There is a large passageway leading westward.
42,You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
42,on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
42,an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
43,Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
43,actions.
44,             BOOOOOOOOOM
45,You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
45,corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
45,dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
45,obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
45,label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-
45,ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
45,inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.
46,closed
47,The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.
48,You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
49,In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
49,is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
50,A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
50,from the ceiling and lifts you away...
51,You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
51,of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
51,wooden railing which circles the dome.
52,Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
52,from the floor below.
53,I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.
54,You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
54,staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
54,large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
54,around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
54,center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
55,A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
55,five feet above your head.
56,You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
57,Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
58,According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
58,fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
58,I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.
59,You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:
59,
59,     "Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
59,
59,The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
59,mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
59,hideous fate, can be heard.
60,The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
60,attempts to pass.
61,There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
61,cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
61,are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
62,You are not equipped for an exorcism.
63,There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
63,cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presence
63,of a greater power, flee through the walls.
64,You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
64,room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
64,sounds of thousands of lost souls weaping and moaning.  In
64,the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
64,adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
64,is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
65,amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
65,tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
66,You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
66,quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
66,to the north, south, east, and down.
67,The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
67,be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
67,the lake.
68,It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
68,the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-
68,stream through the gates.
69,There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
69,panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
70,The green bubble is glowing.
71,The water level is now up to your ankles.
72,The water level is now up to your shins.
73,The water level is now up to your knees.
74,The water level is now up to your hips.
75,The water level is now up to your waist.
76,The water level is now up to your chest.
77,The water level is now up to your neck.
78,The water level is now over your head.
79,The water level is now high in your lungs.
80,The room is full of water and cannot be entered.
81,I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.
82,You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
82,Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
83,The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
83,suddenly vanish.
84,Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
85,Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
85,smart thing to do, apparently.
86,You seem to be digging a hole here.
87,The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
88,You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
89,You can see a small statue in the sand.
90,The wall collapses, smothering you.
91,There is nothing to dig into here.
92,You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
93,You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
94,You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
95,This is getting you nowhere.
96,You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
96,drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
96,There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
97,A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
98,A solid rainbow spans the falls.
99,
100,You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
100,volcano is about 200 feet above and there is a precipitous drop
100,below to the floor.
101,The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
102,There is a small door to the south.
103,The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
104,You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
104,for an exit on the north side.
105,Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
105,the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
105,chipped out of the front of it.
106,On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
107,You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
107,There are exits to the east and southeast.
108,As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.
109,The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.
110,The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
111,The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
112,The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
113,The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
113,chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
113,ground.  Fatally.
114,The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
115,You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
115,that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
115,dungeon has collapsed.
116,The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
116,turning you into  pancake.
117,The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
117,turning you into a pancake.
118,A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
118,"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
118,trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
118,You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.
119,Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
119,seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
119,voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
119,have persisted through many triad tests and have overcome them
119,all.  One such as yourself is fit to joint even the implementers!"
119,He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
119,wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
120,Unfortunately, as the wraith fades, in his place appears a tastefully
120,lettered sign reading:
120,
120,            Soon to be constructed on this site
120,            A complete modern Dungeon endgame
120,               Designed and built by the
120,            FROBOZZ Magic Dungeon Company, Ltd.
120,
121,Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
122,The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
122,at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.
123,The lid opens.
124,The lid closes.
125,Look around.
126,You think it isn't?
127,I think you've already done that.
128,The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
128,attempt by robbers to remove it).
129,The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.
130,You have destroyed the bottle.  Well done.
131,A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.
132,The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.
133,The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.
134,It is not tied to anything.
135,There is nothing it can be tied to.
136,The rope is already attached.
137,The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
138,It is not tied to anything.
139,Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.
140,The rope drops gently to the floor below.
141,The rope is tied to the railing.
142,The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
143,The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
143,notice an irregularity beneath it.
144,The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
145,With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
145,With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
146,Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
146,to move it again.
147,You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
148,Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
149,The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
149,an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
150,Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
150,than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
151,There is an explosion nearby.
152,The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
153,The match has gone out.
154,The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
155,The lamp is dying.
156,The candles grow short.
157,The candles are very short.
158,The leaves burn and the neighbors start to complain.
159,The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
159,the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
160,As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
160,of blinding blue light.
161,As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
161,overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
161,is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
161,savagely cuts your throat.
162,A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
162,of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
162,all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
162,the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
163,There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
164,There is an ugly person staring at you.
165,The mirror is broken into many pieces.
166,Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
167,You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
167,good luck available.
168,Haven't you done enough already?
169,The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
169,devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
169,downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
169,there is a passageway leading west.
170,The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
170,you in the dark.
171,The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
172,Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
173,burned out ivory torch
174,There is a burned out ivory torch here.
175,The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
176,The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
177,The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
178,You seem unable to affect these spirits.
179,How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
180,The book is open to page 569.
181,As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
182,A booming voice says, "wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
182,have turned into a pile of dust.
183,I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
184,One of the matches starts to burn.
185,The match is out.
186,The tube refuses to accept anything.
187,The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
188,The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
189,The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
189,a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
189,gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
190,The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
190,put in that drink, anyway?).
191,The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
191,your generous gesture.
192,The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
193,The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
194,The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
195,The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
196,The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
197,The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
197,condiments for his upcoming snack.
198,The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
199,You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
200,Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
200,they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
201,The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
202,The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
203,You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
204,Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
204,tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
205,Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
205,artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
206,worthless piece of canvas
207,There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
208,With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
209,The window closes (more easily than it opened).
210,The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
211,The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
212,The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
213,I can't see any grating here.
214,The grating is locked.
215,The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
216,The grating opens.
217,The grating is unlocked.
218,The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
218,into darkness.
219,The door swings shut and closes.
220,The door is locked from above.
221,The door cannot be opened.
222,You cannot burn this door.
223,The door is invulnerable.
224,You cannot damage this door.
225,The door is still under warranty.
226,The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
226,of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
226,excitement fades.
227,The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
228,A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
229,The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
229,"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
230,The lights within the room shut off.
231,The lights within the room come on.
232,Click.
233,There is a rumbling sound and a stream of water appears to burst
233,from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
233,in a pipe).
234,The blue button appears to be jammed.
235,The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
236,The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
237,You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
238,This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
239,Well done.  The boat is repaired.
240,There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
241,The boat deflates.
242,You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
243,The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
244,Very good.
245,The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
246,Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
246,walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
247,The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
247,precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
247,by water vapor.
248,The ballon is fastened to the hook.
249,The balloon is not tied to anything.
250,The wire falls off the hook.
251,The box is imbedded in the wall.
252,What do you expect, BOOM?
253,The box has no door!
254,The box is rusted and will not open.
255,The box is not open, chomper!
256,The wire starts to burn.
257,"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
257,# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
257,of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
257,sloping downward.
258,"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
258,the # in his rock hard hands.
259,The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
260,Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
260,would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
260,prevent this.
261,Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
261,your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
261,of your life.
262,Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
262,for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disppear immediately.
263,As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
263,to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
263,into the room.
264,As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
264,ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
264,Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
264,crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
265,There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
266,Nothing seems to happen.
267,The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
268,The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
269,A dull thump is heard in the distance.
270,The flask breaks into pieces.
271,Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
272,Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
272,flask's contents are fatal.
273,Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
274,The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
274,be clearly visible.
275,You can't see through that!
276,The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
277,The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
278,The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
279,The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
280,The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
281,The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
281,from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
281,with blasting cakes.
282,You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
283,The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
284,The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
284,that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
284,more or less demolished.
285,The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
285,floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
286,How romantic!
287,If you must... Poof, you're dead!
288,The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
288,earth.  His favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
288,appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
288,seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
288,to tell the tale.
289,There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
289,the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
290,The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
291,The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
292,You notice that the # has burned out, and that
292,the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
293,I hope you have more light than from a #.
294,I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
294,# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
294,there is still justice in the world.
295,Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
295,gas.  I would have though twice about carrying a # in here.
296,There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
297,The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
298,You won't melt it with a #.
299,The bolt can't be turned with your #.
300,It seems that a # won't do.
301,With a #?
302,The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
302,appendage in thanks.
303,A #?  Surely you jest.
304,He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
304,kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
305,You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
306,I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
307,At your service!
308,The FROBOZZ Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
309,Well, foo, bar, and bletch to you too!
310,It could very well be too late.
311,The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
312,Naturally!
313,AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
314,Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
315,Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
316,Are you enjoying yourself?
317,Wheeeeee!
318,Do you expect me to applaud?
319,Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
320,You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
321,It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
322,Tough shit, asshole.
323,Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
324,That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
325,I think you are taking this thing for granite.
326,Brief descriptions.
327,Long descriptions.
328,No long descriptions.
329,Some long descriptions.
330,Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
331,I don't really see how.
332,I think that swimming is best performed in water.
333,Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
334,Wasn't he an Indian?
335,I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
335,barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
335,of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
336,Wasn't he a sailor?
337,The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
337,by knocking down the wall on the north size of the room.
338,There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
339,Well what?
340,If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
341,Nothing happens.
342,I don't really know how to do that.
343,Do you wish to leave the game?
344,Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
345,Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
346,Hello.
347,Good day.
348,Nice weather we've been having lately.
349,Goodbye.
350,Here, nothing happens.
351,Nothing happens here.
352,I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
353,You seem to be repeating yourself.
354,The # bows his head to you in greeting.
355,I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
356,It is impossible to read in the dark.
357,How does one look through a #?
358,How can I read a #?
359,How, exactly, do I ring that?
360,Ding, dong.
361,I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
362,If you wish, but I can't understand why.
363,Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
363,you want to brush them with.
364,A nice idea, but with a #?
365,Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
365,glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
365,and you die of respiratory failure.
366,
367,Inflating it further would probably burst it.
368,How can you inflate that?
369,Come on, now!
370,The # isn't sleeping.
371,This has no affect.
372,does not seem to do anything useful
373,is not notably useful
374,isn't very interesting
375,doesn't appear worthwhile
376,has no effect
377,doesn't do anything
378,Kicking a # #.
379,Waving a # #.
380,Playing in this way with a # #.
381,Fiddling with a # #.
382,Pushing the # #.
383,I don't think so.
384,This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
385,How can you tie that to anything?
386,You can't tie the # to that.
387,You could certainly never tie the # with that!
388,The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
389,Why would you tie up a #?
390,You can't turn that.
391,You certainly can't turn it with a #.
392,Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
393,Digging with a # is silly.
394,I don't think that anybody is home.
395,Why knock on a #?
396,It sounds like there is something inside the #.
397,All of the objects in the # spill out.
398,I can't get to that to move it.
399,You can't move the #.
400,You can't turn that on.
401,It is already on.
402,You can't turn that off.
403,It is already off.
404,The # is now on.
405,The # is now off.
406,It is now pitch black.
407,You must tell me how to do that to a #.
408,The # cannot be opened.
409,Opened.
410,Opening the # reveals:
411,The # cannot be closed.
412,It is already open.
413,It is already closed.
414,Closed.
415,There is a # here.
416,You are carrying a #.
417,It is in the #, which is in the room.
418,It is in the #, which you are carrying.
419,Time passes...
420,The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
421,I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
422,You are already in the #, cretin!
423,You are now in the #.
424,You aren't in that!
425,You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
425,be fatal.
426,You are on your own feet again.
427,You can't go there without a vehicle.
428,You can't go there in a #.
429,I see nothing special about the #.
430,It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
431,You are in the #.
432,The # has died.
433,The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
433,the guttural tounge of the trolls.
434,The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
434,bloody axe.
435,An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
435,of the room are open.
436,A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
436,out of the room.
437,The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
438,The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
439,The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
440,The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
441,The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
442,and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
443,and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
443,troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
443,not look pleased.
444,Due to an implementation restriction, # can't be put in a #.
445,You can't take the #.
446,I can't find any water here.
447,That would be a good trick.
448,The # is too big to jump over.
449,You should have looked before you leaped.
450,I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
451,In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
452,Geronimo...
453,I don't think that the # would agree with you.
454,I think you should get that first.
455,Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
456,How can I drink that?
457,I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
458,Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
458,this talking.
459,The # catches fire.
460,Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
461,You don't have that.
462,The # catches fire and is consumed.
463,I don't think you can burn a #.
464,It doesn't seem to work.
465,Can you unlock a grating with a #?
466,Munging a # #.
467,Trying to kill a # #.
468,Trying to attack a # #.
469,There is nothing here to attack.
470,I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
471,with your bare hands is suicidal
472,with that is very self-destructive
473,You are in perfect health.
474,You have a light wound.
475,You have a serious wound.
476,You have several wounds.
477,You have serious wounds.
478,You are dead.
479,You can be killed by one more light wound.
480,You can be killed by a serious wound.
481,You can survive one serious wound.
482,You are strong enough to take several wounds.
483,You have been killed once.
484,You have been killed twice.
485,This gives you the rank of cheater.
486,This gives you the rank of wizard.
487,This gives you the rank of master.
488,This gives you the rank of winner.
489,This gives you the rank of hacker.
490,This gives you the rank of adventurer.
491,This gives you the rank of junior adventurer.
492,This gives you the rank of novice adventurer.
493,This gives you the rank of amateur adventurer.
494,This gives you the rank of beginner.
495,Your sword is no longer glowing.
496,Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
497,You sword has begun to glow very brightly.
498,Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
498,neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.
499,The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
499,recovers his stilletto.
500,His booty remains.
501,As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
501,treasures reappear:  A #.
502,A #.
503,There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
503,against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.
504,There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
504,ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.
505,The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
505,when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
506,Once you got him, what would you do with him?
507,You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
507,it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
507,seem angered by your attempt.
508,You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.
509,You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
509,but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.
510,Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
511,The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
511,stupid as you are?
512,The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.
513,The candles are not lit.
514,The flame is extinguished.
515,Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
515,burn.
516,With what?
517,The candles are lit.
518,The candles are already lit.
519,You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.
520,You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.
521,The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.
522,Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
523,Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.
524,You can't go that way.
525,The # is closed.
526,I can't reach that.
527,You aren't carrying that.
528,Dropped.
529,Thrown.
530,You watch as the balloon slowly lands.
531,The balloon has landed.
532,You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.
533,You watch as the balloon slowly descends.
534,The balloon descends.
535,You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.
536,Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
536,causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?
537,You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.
538,The balloon ascends.
539,You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
539,due to its light load.
540,The balloon leaves the ledge.
541,You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.
542,The balloon slowly rises from the ground.
543,The cloth bag is draped over the side.
544,The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
544,in the receptacle.
545,The balloon is tied to the hook.
546,I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.
547,You are tied to the ledge.
548,You don't really want to hold a burning #.
549,The receptacle is already occupied.
550,The # burns inside the receptacle.
551,The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.
552,I can't see one here.
553,You are in it, turkey!
554,A valiant attempt.
555,You can't be serious.
556,Not a prayer.
557,You already have it.
558,Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
559,Taken.
560,Nice try.
561,I can't do that.
562,I can't reach inside.
563,How can you do that?
564,The # is already in the #.
565,It won't fit.
566,I can't reach the #.
567,The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
568,"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."
569,"My vision is not that good without eyes."
570,"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."
571,ECHO
571,The acoustics of the room change subtly.
572,Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
572,sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
572,carcass has disappeared.
573,The # contains:
574,Your collection of treasures consists of:
575,You are carrying:
576,The # is carrying:
577,By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
577,stop the leak in the dam.
578,You are empty handed.
579,It is too dark in here to see.
580,#:
581,I could't find anything.
582,I couldn't find any valuables.
583,Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
583,walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
583,the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
584,Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
584,valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
584,nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
585,The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
585,Fortunately, he took nothing.
586,A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
586,nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
587,A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
587,the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
587,room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
587,others before...".
588,The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
588,left disgusted.
589,The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
589,have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
590,Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
590,fine # is doing here?"
591,You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
591,ineffective.
592,Attacking a dead # is pointless.
593,Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?
594,The # slowly regains his feet.
595,The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.
596,It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
596,that you are dead.

598,I can't access the save file.
599,Restored.
600,Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.
601,I don't understand that.
602,You cannot talk to that!
603,You cannot talk through another person.
604,Please input the entire command again.
605,Fortunately, you still have a #.
606,You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
606,leading up.
607,A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
607,adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
607,and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
607,friendly, though he likes people.
608,The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
608,think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
608,a cyclops.
609,The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
609,His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
610,The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
610,blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
611,On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
611,now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.
612,The bottle is closed.
613,The bottle is already full.
614,The bottle is now full of water.
615,The water slips through your fingers.
616,Too many prepositions.
617,Too many objects.
618,I can't see one here.
619,Which one do you mean?
620,I can't reach that from inside the #.
621,What should I do with the #?
622,Huh?
623,You must supply a direct object.
624,You must supply an indirect object.

34,east, there appears to be sunlight.
35,You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  To the
35,east, there appears to be sunlight.
37,You are in a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway.
37,Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine and a steep staircase
37,descends.
38,You are in a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling.  Your footing
38,is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks underfoot.
38,Passages can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the
38,crawlway.
42,You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream.  The path
42,travels to the north and the east.
43,You are on the gently flowing stream.  The upstream route is too narrow
43,to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting
43,walls.  There is a narrow beach to land on.
44,You are in a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.  There is an
44,ascending staircase in the room as well as doors east and south.
46,You are in a small chamber behind the remains of the great glacier.
46,To the south and west are small passageways.
47,You are in an ancient room, long buried by the reservoir.  There are
47,exits to the southeast and upward.
48,You are on the south edge of a deep canyon.  Passages lead off
48,to the east, south, and northwest.  You can hear the sound of
48,flowing water below.
49,You are in a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from
49,the ground.  There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone
49,stairway leading upward.  The room is extremely noisy.  In fact, it
49,is difficult to hear yourself think.
52,You are in a small cave with an entrance to the north and a stairway
52,leading down.
53,You are in a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,
53,forbidding staircase leading down.
54,You are in a steep and narrow crawlway.  There are two exits nearby to
54,the south and southwest.
55,You are in a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south,
55,However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.
56,You are in a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway
56,intersects with a northward path.
57,You are in a winding passage.  It seems that there is only an exit
57,on the east end, although the whirring from the round room can be
57,heard faintly to the north.
58,You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a
58,coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE
58,WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and
58,there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance
58,of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the
58,north is a small opening.
59,You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
59,mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,
59,and there is another exit on the south end of the room.
60,You are in a small room.  Strange squeaky sounds may be hear coming
60,from the passage at the west end.  You may also escape to the south.
61,You are in a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft
61,descending through the floor into darkness below.  To the west and
61,the north are exits from this room.  Constructed over the top of the
61,shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached.
62,You are in a narrow tunnel with large wooden beams running across
62,the ceiling and around the walls.  A path from the south splits into
62,paths running west and northeast.
63,You are in a small non-descript room.  However, from the direction
63,of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected.  To the
63,east is a narrow path.
64,You are in a small room which smells strongly of coal gas.
65,You are in a very small room.  In the corner is a rickety wooden
65,ladder, leading downward.  It might be safe to descend.  There is
65,also a staircase leading upward.
66,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
67,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
68,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
69,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
70,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
71,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
72,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
73,You are in a rather wide room.  On one side is the bottom of a
73,narrow wooden ladder.  To the northeast and the south are passages
73,leaving the room.
74,Dead end.
75,You are in a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
75,timbers.  A wide passage comes from the north and turns at the
75,southwest corner of the room into a very narrow passageway.
76,You are in a small square room which is at the bottom of a long
76,shaft.  To the east is a passageway and to the northeast a very narrow
76,passage.  In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain.
81,You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east.
81,There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.
82,You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
82,seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow
82,passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
84,You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.
85,A chasm runs southwest to northeast.  You are on the south edge.  The
85,path exits to the south and to the east.
86,You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but
86,the cave narrows to a crack to the west.  The earth is particularly
86,damp here.
87,A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the
87,cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions.
88,Dead end.
89,Dead end.
90,You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
91,This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.
91,To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the
91,following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without
91,solving this riddle--
91,     What is tall as a house,
91,     Round as a cup,
91,     And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".
92,This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.
95,You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of
95,stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.
96,You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
96,ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
96,The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
96,room is through huge marble pillars.
97,You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what
97,appears to be an altar.
99,This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
99,the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
99,"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.
100,You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
100,control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
100,room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
100,the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
100,panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
100,different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
100,room are in the west and south ends.
102,You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the
102,east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about
102,cyclops sized).
103,This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
103,of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
103,on the floor.
104,You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
104,and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
104,Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
104,northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
104,extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
104,you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
104,could get back down.
105,You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
105,have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
105,left through either the north or south exits.
106,You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
106,and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
106,river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
106,from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
106,way downstream.
107,You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
107,flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
108,The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
108,dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
108,prevent landing on the west.
109,The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
109,the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
109,may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
110,You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
110,white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
110,along the cliffs.
111,You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A
111,narrow path leads north along the shore.
112,The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
112,that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
112,area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.
113,The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
113,shore is a large landing area.
115,You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
115,treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
115,quickly turning around a sharp corner.
116,You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
116,flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.
117,You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
117,to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.
118,You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.
119,You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the
119,barrel is the word "GERONIMO!".
121,You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
121,on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
121,travels east-west here.
122,You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
122,past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
122,cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
122,above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
122,continues to the southeast.
123,You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
123,here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
123,runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.
124,You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
124,You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
124,along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
124,canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
124,climbable.
125,You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
125,there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
125,upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
125,appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
125,northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
125,Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
125,top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
125,west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
125,around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
126,You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you
126,light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only
126,exit here is to the north.
127,You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The
127,top of the volcano is clearly visible here.
128,You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming
128,above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the
128,west side.
129,You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of
129,the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the
129,east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.
130,You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet
130,across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.
131,You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant
131,volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the
131,floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.
132,You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you
132,the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.
132,A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;
132,it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between
132,those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.
134,You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably
134,for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed
134,to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.
136,You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.
136,There are exits here to the west and the south.
137,You are in the tomb of the unknown implementer.  A hollow voice says,
137,"That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
139,You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
139,smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
139,sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
139,which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
139,above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
139,above all the buttons says in English:
139,
139,                DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE
139,
139,There are exits to the west and the south.
140,You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall
140,is a small sticker which reads:
140,
140,            Protected by
140,              FROBOZZ
140,         Magic Alarm Company
140,          (Hello, footpad!).
141,You are trapped inside an iron cage.
142,You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on
142,the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the
142,entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily.
143,You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
143,mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be
143,some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west.
144,You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large
144,oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the
144,objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern
144,corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.
144,There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.
145,You are in an enormous room, in the center  of which are four wooden
145,posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to
145,be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be
145,abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large
145,chasm on the west and the northwest.
146,You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a
146,large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is
146,falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.

8,**** READING MATERIAL ****
41,The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by
41,an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the
41,ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs
41,are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred
41,texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems
41,to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.
44,The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly
44,remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can
44,be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects, absent-
44,mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The
44,final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the
44,dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient
44,Zorkers were obscure indeed.
47,             Commandment #12592
47,Oh ye who go about saying unto each other:  "Hello sailor":
47,Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
47,Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
47,Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
47,Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
47,Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
47,unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
47,Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

49,             Flood Control Dam #3
49,
49,  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
49,Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
49,Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
49,Zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
49,tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
49,is composed of 3.7 million cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall
49,at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created
49,behind the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12
49,million square feet, and a shore line of 37 thousand feet.
49,
49,  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
49,the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
49,drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
49,tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
49,bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
49,12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
49,processors, and nearly one million dead trees.
49,
49,  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
49,FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

51,Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
51,to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
51,I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."
51,
51,Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
51,forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
51,future and make really big Zorkmids."

52,   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
52,you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
52,man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
52,within.
52,
52,   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
52,of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
52,vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
52,fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
52,
52,   No computer system should be without one!
52,
52,   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
52,Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
52,Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
52,Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
52,and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
52,The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN by Bob Supnik
52,of DEC Disk Engineering.
52,
52,   On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.
