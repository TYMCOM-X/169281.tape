100	GAME; SHE ESCAPED FROM ANOTHER GAME IN THE NEXT TOWN! THERE REALLY
100	IS NO VAULT IN THIS CAVE...SHE'S REFERING TO THE NEXT CAVE. SORRY
100	AGAIN."  WITH THAT, HE TAKES HER HAND, AND THEY START TO VANISH.
100	AS THEY FADE OUT OF SIGHT, YOU NOTE THAT SHE HAS TAKEN HIS HAT,
100	AND IS BEATING HIM SEVERELY ABOUT THE EARS WITH IT.

200	A GIANT HAIRY SPIDER, NAMED "GRENDL", DROPS FROM THE CEILING, BARELY
200	MISSING YOU!  IT STARTS TO CHASE YOU AROUND THE ROOM, TRYING TO GET
200	YOU!

1	YOU ARE NEAR CRYSTAL CAVE PARK, WHERE OTHERS HAVE FOUND FORTUNES IN
1	TREASURE AND GOLD, THOUGH IT IS RUMORED THAT SOME WHO ENTER ARE NEVER
1	SEEN AGAIN.  MAGIC IS SAID TO WORK IN THE CAVE.  I WILL BE YOUR EYES
1	AND HANDS.  DIRECT ME WITH COMMANDS OF 1 OR 2 WORDS.  I SHOULD WARN
1	YOU THAT I LOOK AT ONLY THE FIRST FIVE LETTERS OF EACH WORD, SO YOU'LL
1	HAVE TO ENTER "NORTHEAST" AS "NE" TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM "NORTH".
1	(SHOULD YOU GET STUCK, TYPE "HELP" FOR SOME GENERAL HINTS.  FOR INFOR-
1	MATION ON HOW TO END YOUR ADVENTURE, ETC., TYPE "INFO".)
1				      - - -
1	THIS PROGRAM IS BASED ON, AND INTENDED AS A SEQUEL TO, THE ADVENTURE
1	GAME, ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY WILLIE CROWTHER AT STANFORD.
2	A LITTLE DWARF WITH A BIG KNIFE BLOCKS YOUR WAY.
3	A LITTLE DWARF JUST WALKED AROUND A CORNER, SAW YOU, THREW A LITTLE
3	AXE AT YOU WHICH MISSED, CURSED, AND RAN AWAY.
4	THERE IS A THREATENING LITTLE DWARF IN THE ROOM WITH YOU!
5	ONE SHARP NASTY KNIFE IS THROWN AT YOU!
6	NONE OF THEM HIT YOU!
7	ONE OF THEM GETS YOU!
8	THERE IS NO ONE HERE TO PAY!
9	THERE IS NO WAY TO GO THAT DIRECTION.
10	I AM UNSURE HOW YOU ARE FACING.  USE COMPASS POINTS OR NEARBY OBJECTS.
11	I DON'T KNOW IN FROM OUT HERE.	USE COMPASS POINTS OR NAME SOMETHING
11	IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO.
12	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY THAT WORD HERE.
13	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT!
14	I'M GAME.  WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN HOW?
15	THE BALROG IS A HIDEOUS CREATURE OF IMMENSE STRENGTH WHO DWELLS IN
15	DARK, FORBIDDING PLACES.
16	IT IS NOW PITCH DARK. IF YOU PROCEDE YOU WILL LIKELY FALL INTO A PIT
17	IF YOU PREFER, SIMPLY TYPE N RATHER THAN NORTH.
18	THERE IS A RANGER BEHIND YOU!  HE SAYS:
19	THE RAPIDS ARE TOO SWIFT TO CROSS!
20	YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR WALLET!
21	YOUR WALLET IS EMPTY!
22	DO YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT NOW?
23	YOU FELL INTO A PIT AND BROKE EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY!
24	YOU ARE ALREADY CARRYING IT!
25	YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!
26	THE BOAT IS ALREADY UNTIED!
27	THE BOAT IS ALREADY TIED!
28	THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH A LOCK!
29	YOU AREN'T CARRYING IT!
30	THE BOAT IS A WRECK!
31	YOU HAVE NO KEYS!
32	THE BOAT WAS IN THE PATH OF THE WALL OF WATER!
33	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOCK OR UNLOCK SUCH A THING.
34	IT WAS ALREADY LOCKED.
35	THE DOOR IS NOW LOCKED.
36	THE DOOR IS NOW UNLOCKED.
37	IT WAS ALREADY UNLOCKED.
38	YOU HAVE NO SOURCE OF LIGHT.
39	YOUR LAMP IS NOW ON.
40	YOUR LAMP IS NOW OFF.
41	THE DAM CRASHES OPEN WITH A MIGHTY ROAR.  A GIGANTIC WALL OF
41	WATER LEAPS ACROSS THE LAKE AND DOWN THE STREAM PASSAGE,
41	DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN IT'S PATH.
42	NOTHING HAPPENS.
43	WHERE?
44	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO ATTACK.
45	YOU WERE IN THE BOAT...YOU ARE DEAD!!!
46	THE GATE IS LOCKED!
47	YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.
48	YOU ATTACK A LITTLE DWARF, BUT HE DODGES OUT OF THE WAY.
49	WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?
50	GOOD TRY, BUT THAT IS AN OLD WORN-OUT MAGIC WORD.
51	I KNOW OF PLACES, ACTIONS, AND THINGS.	MOST OF MY VOCABULARY
51	DESCRIBES PLACES AND IS USED TO MOVE YOU THERE.  TO MOVE, TRY WORDS
51	LIKE FOREST, BARN, LEAVE, ENTER, IN, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH, UP
51	OR DOWN.  I KNOW ABOUT A FEW SPECIAL OBJECTS, LIKE A BOAT LOCATED
51	IN THE CAVE.  THESE OBJECTS CAN BE MANIPULATED USING SOME OF THE
51	ACTION WORDS THAT I KNOW.  USUALLY YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE BOTH THE
51	OBJECT AND ACTION WORDS (IN EITHER ORDER), BUT SOMETIMES I CAN INFER
51	THE OBJECT FROM THE VERB ALONE.  SOME OBJECTS ALSO IMPLY VERBS; IN
51	PARTICULAR, "INVENTORY" IMPLIES "TAKE INVENTORY", WHICH CAUSES ME TO
51	GIVE YOU A LIST OF WHAT YOU'RE CARRYING.  THE OBJECTS HAVE SIDE
51	EFFECTS.  USUALLY PEOPLE HAVING TROUBLE MOVING JUST NEED TO TRY A FEW
51	MORE WORDS.  USUALLY PEOPLE TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MANIPULATE AN
51	OBJECT ARE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING BEYOND THEIR (OR MY!) CAPABILITIES
51	AND SHOULD TRY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TACK.
51	TO SPEED THE GAME YOU CAN SOMETIMES MOVE LONG DISTANCES WITH A SINGLE
51	WITH A SINGLE WORD.  FOR EXAMPLE, "BARN" USUALLY GETS YOU TO THE BARN
51	FROM ANYWHERE ABOVE GROUND EXCEPT WHEN LOST IN THE FOREST.  ALSO, NOTE
51	THAT CAVE PASSAGES TURN A LOT, AND THAT LEAVING A ROOM TO THE NORTH
51	DOES NOT GUARANTEE ENTERING THE NEXT FROM THE SOUTH.
51	GOOD LUCK!
52	IT MISSES!
53	IT GETS YOU!
54	OK
55	YOU CAN'T UNLOCK THE KEYS.
56	YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE HOLES AND WOUND UP BACK IN THE
56	MAIN PASSAGE.
57	FOR AN INSTANT, YOU CATCH SIGHT OF A DOORWAY, BUT IT IMMEDIATELY
57	WAVERS AND THEN DISAPPEARS!
58	I NEED MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS TO DO THAT.
59	I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU SEE AS YOU MOVE ABOUT AND MANIPULATE
59	THINGS.  I CANNOT TELL YOU WHERE REMOTE THINGS ARE.
60	I DON'T KNOW THAT WORD.
61	WHAT?
62	ARE YOU TRYING TO GET INTO THE CAVE?
63	THE GATE IS VERY SOLID AND HAS A HARDENED STEEL LOCK.  THE RANGER
63	WON'T LET YOU IN WITHOUT PAYING, AND YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR WALLET.
63	I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU FIND WHERE YOU LEFT YOUR WALLET.
64	THE TREES OF THE FOREST ARE LARGE HARDWOOD OAK AND MAPLE, WITH AN
64	OCCASIONAL GROVE OF PINE OR SPRUCE.  THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF UNDER-
64	GROWTH, LARGELY BIRCH AND ASH SAPLINGS PLUS NONDESCRIPT BUSHES OF
64	VARIOUS SORTS.	THIS TIME OF YEAR VISIBILITY IS QUITE RESTRICTED BY
64	ALL THE LEAVES, BUT TRAVEL IS QUITE EASY IF YOU DETOUR AROUND THE
64	SPRUCE AND BERRY BUSHES.
65	WELCOME TO THE CRYSTAL CAVE ADVENTURE!!  WOULD YOU LIKE
65	INSTRUCTIONS?
66	DIGGING WITHOUT A SHOVEL IS QUITE IMPRACTICAL.	EVEN WITH A SHOVEL
66	PROGRESS IS UNLIKELY.
67	BLASTING REQUIRES DYNAMITE.
68	I'M AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE.
69	MIST IS A WHITE VAPOR, USUALLY WATER, SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME IN
69	CAVERNS.  IT CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE BUT IS FREQUENTLY A SIGN OF A DEEP
69	PIT LEADING DOWN TO WATER.
70	YOUR FEET ARE NOW WET.
71	I THINK I JUST LOST MY APPETITE.
72	THANK YOU, IT WAS DELICIOUS!
73	YOU HAVE TAKEN A DRINK OF WATER.  THE WATER TASTES STRONGLY OF
73	MINERALS, BUT IS NOT UNPLEASANT.  IT IS EXTREMELY COLD.
74	IT IS NOW EMPTY.
75	RUBBING THE ELECTRIC LAMP IS NOT PARTICULARLY REWARDING.  ANYWAY,
75	NOTHING EXCITING HAPPENS.
76	PECULIAR.  NOTHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS.
77	THE GROUND IS NOW WET.
78	YOU CAN'T POUR THAT.
79	WATCH IT.
80	WHICH WAY?
81	OH DEAR, YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELF KILLED.  DO YOU WANT ME
81	TO TRY TO REINCARNATE YOU?
82	ALL RIGHT.  BY THE WAY, I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, SO DON'T
82	BLAME ME IF SOMETHING GOES WR......
82			    --- POOF!! ---
82	YOU ARE ENGULFED IN A CLOUD OF SULPHUROUS WHITE SMOKE.	COUGHING
82	AND GASPING, YOU EMERGE FROM THE SMOKE AND FIND....
83	OH-OH!	I DARESAY YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.  THE REINCARNATION WORKED
83	LAST TIME.  DO YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A GO AGAIN?
84	OK.  I USED THE WHITE LAST TIME, LET'S SEE WHAT THIS DOES.....
84			 | | F O O P | |
84	OOPS!
84	THE SMOKE IS A NAUSEOUS PURPLE THIS TIME, AND AS IT CLEARS,
85	I SAY THERE, THIS IS BECOMING TIRESOME.  SHALL WE TRY AGAIN?
86	RIGHT!	WHAT DOES THIS DO??
86			XXXX   XXX   XXX  XXXXX
86		*	X   X X   X X	X X	     *
86	      *   *	XXXX  X   X X	X XXXX	   *   *
86		*	X     X   X X	X X	     *
86			X      XXX   XXX  X
86	MY GOODNESS, THAT WAS A GOOD ONE!  BILIOUS BLACK SMOKE ENCIRCLES
86	YOU, CLEARING TO SHOW THAT...
87	YOU CLUMSY OAF, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN!  I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN
87	KEEP THIS UP.  DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY REINCARNATING YOU AGAIN?
88	OKAY, NOW WHERE DID I PUT MY ORANGE SMOKE?....	>POOF!<
88	EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS IN A DENSE CLOUD OF ORANGE SMOKE.
89	NOW YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT!  I'M OUT OF COLOURED SMOKE!	YOU DON'T
89	EXPECT ME TO DO A DECENT REINCARNATION WITHOUT ANY COLOURED SMOKE,
89	DO YOU?
90	OKAY, IF YOU'RE SO SMART, DO IT YOURSELF!  I'M LEAVING!
91	SORRY, BUT I NO LONGER SEEM TO REMEMBER HOW IT WAS YOU GOT HERE.
92	YOU CAN'T CARRY ANYTHING MORE.	YOU'LL HAVE TO DROP SOMETHING FIRST.
93	YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH A LOCKED STEEL GATE!
94	I BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT IS RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.
95	BUGBEARS ARE GREAT HAIRY GOBLIN GIANTS.  DESPITE THEIR SIZE AND
95	SHAMBLING GAIT, THEY MOVE VERY QUIETLY AND ATTACK WITHOUT WARNING
95	WHENEVER THEY CAN.
96	WITH A GRATE OF DRY BONES, THE SKELETON STANDS!  IT IS COMING
96	AFTER YOU.
97	AS YOU DROP THE CHEST, THE SKELETON CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND.
98	YOU'RE NOT CARRYING ANYTHING.
99	YOU ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING THE FOLLOWING:
100	YOU CAN'T GET PAST THE SKELETON!
101	THE SKELETON SWINGS AT YOU AND MISSES!
102	THE SKELETON SWINGS AT YOU...HE GETS YOU!
103	YOU FOOL, DWARVES EAT ONLY COAL!  NOW YOU'VE MADE HIM *REALLY* MAD!!
104	YOU HAVE NOTHING IN WHICH TO CARRY IT.
105	YOUR BOTTLE IS ALREADY FULL.
106	THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH WHICH TO FILL THE BOTTLE.
107	YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF WATER.
108	YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF WINE.
109	YOU CAN'T FILL THAT.
110	DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!
111	YOU CLUTCH CONVULSIVELY AT THE ROCKS, BUT YOU ARE FALLING...
112	THERE IS A SULLEN GLOW FROM THE RUBY.
113	THE RANGER COMMENTS:
113	"YOU'VE BEEN TO THE PIG SINKHOLE!   YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE SMELLING
113	LIKE THAT!  GO TAKE A SHOWER!"
114	HOW, BY SWIMMING?
115	THE RANGER WON'T LET YOU IN WITHOUT PAYING!
116	THE DWARVES' KNIVES VANISH AS THEY STRIKE THE WALLS OF THE CAVE.
117	SOMETHING YOU'RE CARRYING WON'T FIT THROUGH THE TUNNEL WITH YOU.
117	YOU'D BEST TAKE INVENTORY AND DROP SOMETHING.
118	THE BOAT IS TIED!
119	THE BOAT WON'T FIT!
120	IT'S EMPTY!
121	ARE YOU TRYING TO GET FURTHER INTO THE CAVE?
122	THE WATER BEHIND THE DAM IS HIGHER, AND THUS MUST BE THE
122	SOURCE.  IF YOU CAN LOWER THE WATER LEVEL BACK THERE, YOU
122	MAY BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH.
123	IN THE TIME MAZE, THERE ARE PATHS IN *ALL* DIRECTIONS, BOTH
123	PAST AND FUTURE!
124	A COMPELLING FORCE PREVENTS YOU FROM MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION!
125	AFTER A FEW STEPS, YOU ARE THROWN VIOLENTLY BACK!
126	YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE HOLES AND FOUND YOUR WAY
126	BLOCKED BY A RECENT CAVE-IN.  YOU ARE NOW BACK IN THE MAIN PASSAGE.
127	THERE IS A FAINT CURSE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND YOU.
128	OUT FROM THE SHADOWS BEHIND YOU POUNCES A BEARDED PIRATE!  "HAR, HAR,"
128	HE CHORTLES, "I'LL JUST TAKE ALL THIS BOOTY AND HIDE IT AWAY WITH ME
128	CHEST DEEP IN THE GROTTO!"  HE SNATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND VANISHES
128	INTO THE GLOOM.
129	A SEPULCHRAL VOICE REVERBERATING THROUGH THE CAVE, SAYS, "CAVE CLOSING
129	SOON.  ALL ADVENTURERS EXIT IMMEDIATELY THROUGH MAIN OFFICE."
130	A MYSTERIOUS RECORDED VOICE GROANS INTO LIFE AND ANNOUNCES:
130	   "THIS EXIT IS CLOSED.  PLEASE LEAVE VIA MAIN OFFICE."
131	IT LOOKS AS THOUGH YOU'RE DEAD.  WELL, SEEING AS HOW IT'S SO CLOSE TO
131	CLOSING TIME ANYWAY, I THINK WE'LL JUST CALL IT A DAY.
132	THE SEPULCHRAL VOICE ENTONES, "THE CAVE IS NOW CLOSED."  AS THE ECHOES
132	FADE, THERE IS A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT (AND A SMALL PUFF OF WHITE
132	SMOKE). . . .YOU IMMEDIATELY FEEL THE MENACING PRESENCE OF HUNDREDS
132	OF PAIRS OF UNSEEN EYES UPON YOU!  AS YOUR EYES REFOCUS, YOU LOOK
132	AROUND AND FIND...
133	STUNNED, YOU MANAGE TO SWIM TO THE NEARBY BEACH.
134	STUNNED, YOU DROP ALL YOUR TREASURES, WHICH SINK TO THE BOTTOM,
134	OUT OF REACH.  YOU MANAGE TO SWIM TO THE NEARBY BEACH.
135	GRENDL POUNCES - - -
135	AND GETS YOU!!!
136	IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK HERE!
137	GRENDL POUNCES - - -
137	BUT LUCKILY FALLS UPON YOUR SWORD, AND DIES!!
138	I DARESAY WHATEVER YOU WANT IS AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
139	I DON'T KNOW THE WORD "STOP".  USE "QUIT" IF YOU WANT TO GIVE UP.
140	YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM HERE.
141	THE AXE BOUNCES OFF HARMLESSLY, AND FALLS TO ONE SIDE!
142	IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR ADVENTURE EARLY, SAY "QUIT".  TO SUSPEND YOUR
142	ADVENTURE SUCH THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE LATER, SAY "SUSPEND" (OR "PAUSE"
142	OR "SAVE").  TO SEE WHAT HOURS THE CAVE IS NORMALLY OPEN, SAY "HOURS".
142	TO SEE HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING, SAY "SCORE".  TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR A
142	TREASURE, YOU MUST HAVE LEFT IT SAFELY IN THE BUILDING, THOUGH YOU GET
142	PARTIAL CREDIT JUST FOR LOCATING IT.  YOU LOSE POINTS FOR GETTING
142	KILLED, OR FOR QUITTING, THOUGH THE FORMER COSTS YOU MORE.  THERE ARE
142	ALSO POINTS BASED ON HOW MUCH (IF ANY) OF THE CAVE YOU'VE MANAGED TO
142	EXPLORE; IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS A LARGE BONUS JUST FOR GETTING IN (TO
142	DISTINGUISH THE BEGINNERS FROM THE REST OF THE PACK), AND THERE ARE
142	OTHER WAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME OF THE MORE
142	HARROWING SECTIONS.  IF YOU THINK YOU'VE FOUND ALL THE TREASURES, JUST
142	KEEP EXPLORING FOR A WHILE.  IF NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENS, YOU
142	HAVEN'T FOUND THEM ALL YET.  IF SOMETHING INTERESTING *DOES* HAPPEN,
142	IT MEANS YOU'RE GETTING A BONUS AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GARNER MANY
142	MORE POINTS IN THE MASTER'S SECTION.  I MAY OCCASIONALLY OFFER HINTS
142	IF YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING TROUBLE.  IF I DO, I'LL WARN YOU IN ADVANCE
142	HOW MUCH IT WILL AFFECT YOUR SCORE TO ACCEPT THE HINTS.  FINALLY, TO
142	SAVE PAPER, YOU MAY SPECIFY "BRIEF", WHICH TELLS ME NEVER TO REPEAT
142	THE FULL DESCRIPTION OF A PLACE UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY ASK ME TO.
143	DO YOU INDEED WISH TO QUIT NOW?
144	ARE YOU TRYING TO RETURN TO THE MAZE?
145	IN THE TIME MAZE, THERE ARE PATHS IN *ALL* DIRECTIONS, BOTH
145	PAST AND FUTURE!  (YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS HINT FOR FREE
145	IF YOU HAD ASKED ME.)
146	IT IS BEYOND YOUR POWER TO DO THAT.
147	I DON'T KNOW HOW.
148	THE SPICES FLY THROUGH THE AIR, FORMING A FINE CLOUD.  THE DRAGON
148	REARS BACK TRIUMPHANTLY, READY TO BLAST YOU, WHEN THE SPICES MAKE
148	HIM SNEEZE EXPLOSIVELY, AND HIS FIRE IS EXTINGUISHED!
148		A VERY CRESTFALLEN AND WOEBEGON DRAGON LOOKS UP AT YOU AND
148	SAYS "MIND IF I TAG ALONG, BOSS?"
149	YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.  THE BODY VANISHES IN A CLOUD OF GREASY
149	BLACK SMOKE.
150	YOU KILLED THE KOBOLD. THE BODY VANISHES IN A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE.
151	THE BUGBEAR GRABS THE KEYS AND UNLOCKS THE CHAIN!
152	THAT WAS INTENDED AS A RHETORICAL QUESTION!
153	WE'RE ALREADY FLYING!
155	ON WHAT?
156	OKAY, FROM NOW ON I'LL ONLY DESCRIBE A PLACE IN FULL THE FIRST TIME
156	YOU COME TO IT.  TO GET THE FULL DESCRIPTION, SAY "LOOK".
164	THE AXE MISSES AND LANDS NEAR THE BUGBEAR WHERE YOU CAN'T GET AT IT.
165	WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?  AGAINST *HIS* BEAR HANDS??
169	THE BUGBEAR IS STILL CHAINED TO THE WALL.
170	THE CHAIN IS STILL LOCKED.
174	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO EAT.
175	DO YOU WANT THE HINT?
176	DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF THE MAZE?
177	YOU CAN MAKE THE PASSAGES LOOK LESS ALIKE BY DROPPING THINGS.
183	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST START WRAPPING THIS UP, UNLESS
183	YOU CAN FIND SOME FRESH BATTERIES.  I SEEM TO RECALL THERE WERE
183	BATTERIES SOMEWHERE IN THE MAZE.
184	YOUR LAMP HAS RUN OUT OF POWER.
185	THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN WANDERING AROUND OUT HERE, AND YOU CAN'T
185	EXPLORE THE CAVE WITHOUT A LAMP.  SO LET'S JUST CALL IT A DAY.
186	THERE IS A FAINT CURSE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND YOU.  AS YOU TURN
186	TOWARD THEM, THE BEAM OF YOUR LAMP FALLS ACROSS A BEARDED PIRATE.
186	HE IS CARRYING A LARGE CHEST.  "SHIVER ME TIMBERS!" HE CRIES, "I'VE
186	BEEN SPOTTED!  I'D BEST HIE MESELF OFF TO THE GROTTO TO HIDE ME
186	CHEST!	WITH THAT, HE VANISHES INTO THE GLOOM.
187	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST GO BACK FOR THOSE BATTERIES.
188	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  I'M TAKING THE LIBERTY OF REPLACING THE
188	BATTERIES.
189	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM, AND YOU'RE OUT OF SPARE BATTERIES.  YOU'D
189	BEST START WRAPPING THIS UP.
190	"IN CORNWALL THERE WAS A STONE OF POWER -- THE SIEGE PERILOUS.
190	IT WAS SAID TO BE ABLE TO JUDGE A MAN, DETERMINE HIS WORTH, AND
190	THEN DELIVER HIM TO HIS FATE.  ARTHUR WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE LEARNED
190	OF ITS POWER FROM MERLYN, AND INCORPORATED IT AMONG THE SEATS OF
190	THE ROUND TABLE."
191	THANK YOU, HOW REFRESHING TO RELAX.  THESE OLD BONES ARE NOT WHAT
191	THEY USED TO BE.
192	WE'RE ALREADY SITTING!
193	THE DJINNI ARE FREE-WILLED, INTELIGENT, AIR-ELEMENTAL SPIRITS.
193	THEY WILL NOT HARM YOU, BUT MAY AID YOU IF THEY ARE PRESENT.
194	KOBOLDS ARE EVIL, DWARVE-LIKE CREATURES, MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO
194	GOBLINS.  THEY ARE MORE DANGEROUS THAN DWARVES, HOWEVER.
195	I'M AFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
196	THE BUGBEAR GETS YOU, AND GIVES YOU A BIG *BEAR* HUG, BREAKING
196	EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY!
197	OK...
197	OOPS...
197	SORRY ABOUT THAT..CLUMSY OF ME
198	HOW, BY FLYING?
199	THE WIND CATCHES THE CARPET, CAPSIZING IT AND DROPPING YOU OFF!
199	UNBURDENED, IT SAILS IN ONE DIRECTION AS YOU PLUMMET TO THE BOTTOM
199	OF THE SHAFT!
200	IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?
201	THERE'S NO POINT IN SUSPENDING A DEMONSTRATION GAME.
202	I CAN'T FIND IT IN THE DARK
203	THE DRAGON BELCHES FORTH A BALL OF FLAME IN YOUR DIRECTION, WHICH
203	MISSES!  YOU ARE UNABLE TO PICK UP ANYTHING THOUGH, BECAUSE OF THE
203	HEAT!
204	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO TIE THE ROPE AROUND
205	YOU HAVE NO ROPE
206	YOUR ROPE WILL NOT REACH
207	YOU HAVE NOTHING TO CUT WITH
208	DUE TO YOUR SLOPPY WORKMANSHIP, THE KNOT IN THE ROPE HAS
208	COME UNTIED WHILE YOU WERE HALFWAY DOWN. YOU HAVE FALLEN
208	45 FEET ONTO SOME VERY SHARP ROCKS.
209	OK
209	THE DJINN, HIS SERVICE FINISHED, VANISHES!
210	SEVEN MEN, WEARING BUSINESS SUITS AND CARRYING BRIEFCASES,
210	SURROUND YOU AND IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS REPRESENTING THE
210	INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE!
210		"WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATING SOME
210	UNDECLARED INCOME", THEY SCREAM.  "WE WANT TO DISCUSS THIS
210	MATTER WITH YOU!"
210	YOU HAVE BEEN TAXED TO DEATH!!!
211	THE WAY IS BLOCKED!
212	AN IMMENSE WHITE DRAGON LUMBERS OUT OF THE DOOR, BREATHING
212	INCANDESCENTLY HOT BALLS OF FIRE AT YOU, ALL OF WHICH GET YOU!
212	HE THEN BEATS YOU SEVERELY ABOUT THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS WITH HIS
212	WINGS, WHICH HAVE LONG, SHARP TALONS ON THE EDGES!  HE FINALLY
212	JUMPS UP AND DOWN ON YOU, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND
212	OVER AND OVER AND...YOU GET THE IDEA.
213	THE GUARD, 'PATROLMAN PETE' COMES RUNNING OUT OF THE DOORWAY, WAVING
213	HIS PISTOL AND SHOUTING:
213		"THIS AREA IS OFF-LIMITS. . .YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE!".
213	HE TRIPS AND THE GUN ACCIDENTALLY GOES OFF, NEATLY REMOVING YOUR HEAD!
213	YOU ARE DEAD!
212	YOU ARE DEAD!
214	AS YOU SPEAK, SEVERAL LARGE ROCKS DROP DOWN THE SHAFT AND
214	CAROME OFF THE SHELF, NARROWLY MISSING YOU, RAISING A GREAT CLOUD
214	OF DUST, AND STARTING CRACKS IN THE ROCK!
215	YOU MISS!!
215	YOU MANAGE TO CATCH THE EDGE OF THE BRIDGE, AND SWING BACK UP
215	ONTO IT.
216	YOU JUST MANAGE TO CATCH THE FAR EDGE OF THE BRIDGE, AND SWING UP
216	ONTO IT!
217	THINGS ARE LOOKING AWFULLY BLEAK.
218	JUMP!
219	YOU DROP THROUGH AN IMPENETRABLE GLOOM.  OPPRESSIVE FEAR GATHERS,
219	AND CLAWS AT YOU!
219	YOU ARE SINKING INTO THE DEPTHS OF HELL, WITH NO SALVATION IN SIGHT!
219	THE CLAMMY, BLACK AIR WHISTLING PAST YOU IS THE ONLY SOUND WHICH
219	FILLS YOUR FEAR-DRIVEN MIND.
219	YOU ARE TUMBLING ENDLESSLY, SPINNING OVER AND OVER.
219	SUDDENLY, YOU FEEL YOUR DESCENT SLOWING!
219		WITH A RUSH, YOU FINALLY COME TO A LANDING, AND DISCOVER. . . .
220	ALL DIRECTIONS ARE DOWN!! PLEASE BE MORE SPECIFIC.
221	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY SUCH A THING!
222	THE SWEET MUSIC ATTRACTS THE UNICORN, WHO COMES NEAR!
223	HE GRABS YOU AND EFFICIENTLY CONVERTS YOU INTO A PILE OF GREASY
223	RUBBLE!
224	YOU DROP THROUGH AN IMPENETRABLE GLOOM.  OPPRESSIVE FEAR GATHERS,
224	AND CLAWS AT YOU!
224	YOU ARE SINKING INTO THE DEPTHS OF HELL, WITH NO SALVATION IN SIGHT!
224	THE CLAMMY, BLACK AIR WHISTLING PAST YOU IS THE ONLY SOUND WHICH
224	FILLS YOUR FEAR-DRIVEN MIND.
224	YOU ARE TUMBLING ENDLESSLY, SPINNING OVER AND OVER.
224	BELOW YOU, A ROAR ARISES FROM AN UNSEEN SOURCE, AND GETS LOUDER AND
224	LOUDER AND LOUDER!!
224	SUDDENLY, YOU BREAK INTO A LIGHTED AREA, AND IMMEDIATELY CRASH INTO
224	THE DEPTHS OF A BOTTOMLESS POOL OF WATER!
225	I'M SORRY, THAT IS A NEW MAGIC WORD, WHICH DOESN'T WORK YET!
