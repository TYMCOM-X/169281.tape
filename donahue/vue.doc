	CTL-A	Move cursor to beginning of current line.
	
	CTL-B	Move  backwards  one character  position.  If  cursor is
		currently at  position 1,  command will cause  cursor to
		move to last character of preceding line.
		
	CTL-D	Delete character at  current cursor  location. Text  may
		not be restored.
		
	CTL-E	Move cursor to end of current line.
	
	CTL-F	Move  forward  one  character  position.  If  cursor  is
		currently at last character of line, cursor will move to
		first character of next line.
		
	CTL-G	Abort  current command.  Very  useful to  keep  operator
		error from destroying file.
		
	CTL-H	Delete character immediately preceding cursor.  Text may
		not be restored.
		
	CTL-I	Insert tab at current cursor position. Tab counts as one
		character position, but is actually up to eight spaces.
		
	CTL-J	Insert  carriage return  at cursor position,  indent new
		line to position where text began on previous line,  and
		move cursor to new location.
		
	CTL-K	Kill  text  from  cursor  to  end  of line. Text  may be
		restored (see CTL-Y).
		
	CTL-L	Refresh  screen.  Occasionally,  VUE will  make  display
		errors (text is correct,  but display is wrong), so this
		command will correct this condition.
		
	CTL-M	Will create a new line beginning at position 1, and move
		cursor to that position.  Any text following  cursor (on
		same line) before  command is executed  will be moved to
		new line.
		
	CTL-N	Move cursor  down one line.  Cursor  will stay  at  same
		character position if position is in use on line. Use of
		this command at  bottom of screen  will cause last  four
		lines  of text to roll  to screen top,  and new text  to
		fill screen.
		
	CTL-O	Insert carriage return at position preceding cursor, and
		keep cursor at constant position.
		
	CTL-P	Move cursor  up  one  line.  Cursor  will stay  at  same
		character position  if possible.  Use of this command at
		top of  screen will  move cursor  up one line and  cause
		this line and four lines preceeding to fill screen.
		
	CTL-Q	Allows user  to insert control  characters into  file by
		preceding them  with this  command.  As  an example,  to
		insert  a form  feed  into a file,  the user must  enter
		CTL-Q CTL-L.  CTL-Q disables command mode,  and CTL-L is
		a form feed.

	CTL-R	Reverse  Incremental Search.  Will  search for specified
		character(s)  from current cursor  position to beginning
		of file.  Search is on a  character by  character basis,
		and  is  terminated with  the ESC key.  If the specified
		character(s) is not found, user is notified that  search
		failed.

	CTL-S	Forward Incremental Search.  Will search  for  specified
		character(s)  from  current  cursor  position to end  of
		file.  Search is on a character by character basis,  and
		is  terminated  with  the  ESC  key.  If  the  specified
		character(s) is not found,  user is notified that search
		failed.
		
	CTL-T	Transpose two characters  immediately  preceding current
		cursor position.
		
	CTL-U	This command  preceding any other command will cause the
		second command to be executed multiple times.  Number of
		executions may  be specified  between the two  commands.
		Minimum number of executions is four,  and if no  number
		is specified,  four  executions are selected by default.
		This command may be cascaded (multiple executions),  and
		may be used  for VUE commands as well as text insertion/
		deletion/editing.

		EXAMPLE:
		========
		CTL-U CTL-N   will cause cursor to move down four lines.
		CTL-U 12 CTL-N  will  cause  cursor to move  down twelve
				lines.
		CTL-U CTL-U CTL-N will cause cursor to move down sixteen
				  lines (4 x 4)
	CTL-V	Move to next display screen.
	
	CTL-W	Delete  text  from  mark  to  cursor. This  text  may be
		restored.  See CTL-@ for explanation of marks, and CTL-Y
		for restores.
		
	CTL-Y	Restore text.  Used  with  CTL-K,  CTL-W,  ESC-CTL-W  to
		restore killed text.  Cursor may be  repositioned to any
		location before this command is executed,  and text will
		be restored at that location.
		
	CTL-Z	Scroll screen by one line.  Will move one  new  line  of
		text onto bottom of screen.
		
	CTL-@	Set mark.  This will allow user to specify beginning and
		ending points  to text regions which are to be modified.
		Refer to CTL-W, ESC-CTL-W,  and  ESC-CTL-^  for  further
		explanation.
		
	CTL-^	Invert case  of  character  where cursor  is,  and  move
		cursor forward one position.

	ESC-B	Move cursor backward one word.
	
	ESC-D	Delete  current word.  If cursor is  at  a blank  space,
		entire word will  be deleted.  If  cursor is inside  the
		word, text from cursor to end of word is deleted.
		
	ESC-F	Move cursor forward one word.
	
	ESC-H	Delete previous word.  If  cursor is at  a  blank space,
		entire  previous word  will  be deleted.  If  cursor  is
		inside a  word,  area from  cursor  to first blank space
		will be deleted.
		
	ESC-R	Reverse String Search. String to be searched for must be
		entered,  and terminated by  an ESC.  Text  will then be
		searched for first occurrence  of string.  If  string is
		not found, user is notified that  search failed.  String
		is  retained  in  memory,  so  if  same string is  to be
		searched for a second time, user must enter  only ESC-R,
		ESC to initiate the search.
		
	ESC-S	Forward String Search. String to be searched for must be
		entered,  terminated  by  an  ESC.  Text  will  then  be
		searched for first occurrence  of string.  If  string is
		not found, user is notified that  search failed.  String
		is retained in memory,  so  if  same  string  is  to  be
		searched for a second time,  user must enter only ESC-S,
		ESC to initiate the search.
		
	ESC-V	Display previous screen.
	
	ESC-!	Make line where cursor currently resides the top line of
		display.
		
	ESC-$	Substitute  new specified  text string for old specified
		text string.  Will substitute  text from current  cursor
		position to end of file.
		
	ESC-%	Query Replace.  Will replace old  text string  with  new
		text string  with pause  before  each  replace for  user
		approval.  If all occurrences  of specified  text string
		are to be replaced (i.e. user blew it!),  user may enter
		an exclamation point  (!) to terminate  user query,  and
		substitution will proceed as an ESC-$ type substitute.
		
	ESC-^	Invert case of word where cursor resides.
	
	ESC-,	Move cursor to first character of current page.
	
	ESC-.	Move cursor to last character of current page.
	
	ESC-<	Move cursor to beginning of file.
	
	ESC->	Move cursor to end of file.

	ESC-CTL-W	Copy region. Used with CTL-@, will copy a region
			of text  into buffer memory to be inserted where
			user wants by repositioning cursor and executing
			CTL-Y command.  Very handy when a text string is
			used multiple times within a file.
			
	ESC-CTL-^	Invert region. Used with CTL-@, will invert case
			of all  text in area  between mark  and  current
			cursor position.



	----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	

	CTL-X CTL-F	Exit VUE session after saving file.  Will return
			control to EXEC mode.
			
	CTL-X CTL-S	Save file, but remain in VUE. Very useful if you
			happen to be paranoid.
			
	CTL-X CTL-C	Aborts  VUE  session  without  saving  file.  BE
			CAREFUL!!
			
	CTL-X CTL-I	Insert specified file into  VUE editing  session
			at current cursor  position.  When  insertion is
			complete,  cursor will move  to  end of inserted
			file.  This  command  may  or may not be usable,
			depending on the parameters of the file VUE.INI,
			which specifies commands available to the user.
