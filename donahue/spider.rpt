-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The uptime for Spider KL10 for the week of 16-Oct-88 to 23-Oct-88 is in error.
The customer informed Chuck Grant that they had recently change the software
for node 24 which caused the four (4) RCC stopcodes this week.Since this is
a software induced problem I have removed all downtime associated with these
crashes.The uptime for the week is actually 99.311%,factored uptime since 
1-May-88 is now 98.384% and unfactored remains at 96.539%.
