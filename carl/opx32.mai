Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behalf" of another user.
