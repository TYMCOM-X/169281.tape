Landa,
  here is the list of network names that need t be changed.  I need
just a name change.  The users will be expecting their passwords to
remain the same...  Most do NOT have PDP-10 access at the moment, but
a few do...

  also, they need to be added to have access to host 5874 if they do
not already have that access.  (I'll bet almost all of them do).

I appreciate an expedient completion of this change.
At the moment, none of these people have any control
over changeing their own passwords and I want them
to be able to do this before Friday!

Thanks again... -Carl
