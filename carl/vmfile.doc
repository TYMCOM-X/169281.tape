!   Slot_ VMFile( StringSpec, AccessMode )
!	Opens a file for access.  A positive slot number is returned if the
!	file is available.  A value of 0 means no slots available, a negative
!	value means a file operation error or access violation occurred with
!	the RH of the value containing the TYMCOM-X lookup/enter codes.
!	A -1 value indicates an unavailable device.  Access mode is one of:
!	(0=Read !chLK, 1=Write !chENT, 2=Multi-Write !chMEN).
!
!   Ok_ VMFree( Slot, Bits(0) )
!	Closes any open file for this slot and frees the slot for future use.
!	Returns true if the slot was in use.  If any writes were performed
!	the file is actually closed, otherwise the channel is simply released.
!	If writing and Bits = -1 then delete the file, else if bits # 0 use
!	the value of Bits on the close option.
!
!   Line_ VMLine( Slot, More, Dir(0) )
!	Returns the next consecutive line from the file that is connected
!	to the specified slot.  More is set to the line terminator ( LF, FF
!	or VT ) on a normal return, to 0 when the end of the file is reached
!	or the slot is inactive.  Dir is the direction to read the file
!	(0 = forward, non-zero = backward).
!
!   Ok_ VMText( Slot, TextString )
!	Writes the next consecutive line to the file that is connected
!	to the specified slot.  Returns false for insufficient file access
!	and for any other errors while writing, otherwise returns true.
!
!   Ok_ VMMove( Slot, HowMany(1) )
!	Moves the position pointer forward or backward up to how-many lines
!	in the file.  Returns true if the slot is active and the specified
!	number of lines exist, otherwise it returns false and leaves the
!	pointer positioned at logical end of file.
!
!   Position_ VMGetC( Slot, Index )
!	Read the specified characteristic from the file table.  [0]character,
!	[1]line or [2]page position in the file, [3]eol char, [4]eol-cr-seen,
!	size in [5]characters, [6]lines or [7]pages, [8]file license.  If no
!	file is open or an invalid slot, return -2.  If the index is out of
!	range, return -3.  If the file is open, but no reads have been done,
!	return -1.
!
!   Ok_ VMSetC( Slot, CharacterPosition )
!	Set the character position with the file open on the specified slot.
!	All further references to the file will use the new position.  If the
!	specified position is outside the file, the position is set to -1.
!	The routine always returns the new position.
!
!   License_ VMFLic( Slot )
!	Returns the license of the file open on the specified slot.
