Subject: Re: Notes from UNIX class 

To all of you...

  I asked at the desk, and they do have copies of the notes/slides used
for the class.  I do not (yet) know what they want (cost) for additional
copies.

  However, if we assune, MDFSCO is purchasing them.. (or they are free? which
I sincerely doubt)... Who wants a copy, (how many do we want?)

  I will check with Craig at lunchtime (Wednesday) and get the copies
before the class is over... presumably, I will be able to quote the price
at that time.

/Carl
PS  Let Craig know if you want a copy... /Carl

Subject: TUMS features on Unix 

I have read TFM and still have problems with Unix mail.  Especially after
being used to TUMS, using real commands, aliases/macros, and decent help.
The private net and public net people migrating to Unix are going to have
the same problems.  Have you considered creating a TUMS front-end for mail
(like bc is a front-end for dc)?  This may be part of Carl's new job

Subject: Unix Question with access to Host 9929 

Carl,
	Now I have a question.  As exists now, we can use our username are 
able to access system 25 54 ect.  Any timetable or plan on how our usernames
will be validated on the host 9929 for Unix?  Our you going to change the
group access we have now?  (Class of 2 Group of 1 to host 25.)  In the
future will we have a new class and group to host 9929 or will the class
be changed to allow us to colon option to host 9929?  Thanks.



PS  What about the Ticket System on System 56?  Any word on that?

We are sending the following memo to you as managers in the license tree.
Please ensure that all users under your management comply.

The Validations Department is in the process of updating our current infor-
mation on employees who have status names.

We appreciate your cooperation, and we hope you understand that this is a
necessary step to improve the security of our Network. Basically, it will 
provide accountability, and will give us immediate access to the person that
owns the status name.

Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behaf another user.

Debbie,
  I sent a note about SETOP to a group a people that were on the
memo's sent back and forth between Ed and Wayne and used their return
address and apparently they had your name spelled wrong... so, please
get a copy of the message from Ed Roop, or let me know to re-send it

Subject: TUMS features on Unix 

I have read TFM and still have problems with Unix mail.  Especially after
being used to TUMS, using real commands, aliases/macros, and decent help.
The private net and public net people migrating to Unix are going to have
the same problems.  Have you considered creating a TUMS front-end for mail
(like bc is a front-end for dc)?  This may be part of Carl's new job

Subject: Unix Question with access to Host 9929 

Carl,
	Now I have a question.  As exists now, we can use our username are 
able to access system 25 54 ect.  Any timetable or plan on how our usernames
will be validated on the host 9929 for Unix?  Our you going to change the
group access we have now?  (Class of 2 Group of 1 to host 25.)  In the
future will we have a new class and group to host 9929 or will the class
be changed to allow us to colon option to host 9929?  Thanks.



PS  What about the Ticket System on System 56?  Any word on that?

Carl:

	On the Unix front, I logged on about 13:35 on the 8th.  I was
connected but was hung up.  When I tried to log back in, I got a clearing
cause of C:9 and a Diagnostic of 201 Link Failure.  The host then went
shut.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARL,
   I ATTENDED YOUR UNIX CLASS LAST TUESDAY AND AM PREPARING TO GIVE A CLASS
ON WHAT I LEARNED. I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS ON SOME THINGS I NEED CLEARED
UP.
 
1) PLEASE EXPLAIN THE SITUATION ON THE NIB AND BND FILES. I UNDERSTOOD THAT
   THE BND FILES WON'T BE RETAINED IN THE SYSTEM AT ALL, THAT WHEN WE NEED
   TO LOAD A NODE THAT WE'LL HAVE TO LOAD IT A SLOT AT A TIME. I ALSO
   UNDERSTOOD THAT THE NIB FILES WILL BE RETAINED BUT ONLY IN THE BACKUP
   DIRECTORY. PLEASE PLEASE ADVISE IF I AM NOT CORRECT.
 
2) I CAN'T SEEM TO LOG ONTO GEMINI (9929) OR ANY OF THE OTHER SERVERS. HAVE
   YOU HAD AN OPPERTUNITY TO VALIDATE ANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE
   CLASS. IF SO, PLEASE ADVISE ME OF THE LOGON PROCEDURE.
 
3) I'M ABLE TO ACCESS THE REPETE SYSTEM BUT AM UNABLE TO COPY TYM AND CMD
   FILES FROM THE PDP10 (SYSTEM 25). ARE THERE ANY OF THESE FILES OUT ON
   REPETE SO I CAN PLAY WITH VI, JOVE, NAD, ETC?? IF SO WHERE ARE THEY?
 
 
ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN GIVE WOULD BE HELPFULL, I NEED TO GIVE MY CLASS ON
THURSDAY, 6/15 AND THEN ANOTHER ON MONDAY, 6/19 SO YOUR PROMPT RESPONSE
IS REQUESTED. THANKS IN ADVANCE....
 
YOU CAN REACH ME AT NSCMS.D/HOLDERNESS OR 703/556/3233
 
 
                                                REGARDS,

              The transition from the PDP to the UNIX will
              remove all slot nib files.  We have two slot files
              that do not have either the command file or the tym
              file, only the nib.  These slots support the
              Lemcom.  It is my understanding that if we ever
              lose the nib files, we will have a difficult
              (impossible?) task to recreate the nib file.
 
              These slot files are currently located in
              (TYM5)ND6114.N01 and ND6134.N02.
 
              Please get back to me with your plan on keeping
              these nib files intact and safe.

After a shaky start on Monday, we were quite successful with 
the limited number of Nodes we have loaded.
 
Monday uncovered a few procedural discrepancies which 
delayed loading Network Nodes from UNIX  (Monday's projects
were completed from the PDP 10's).  These procedural issues
have been resolved and Code Loads were successful on
Tuesday.
 
This is a major milestone for the UNIX project.  There are
now 5 Nodes running in the public Net which were genned
and loaded from the Fremont Sun Systems.
 
There is a problem, however, with the Field involvement
in these projects.  That is, there has been very little.
As of Tuesday afternoon, only one project Node has had
a slot genned by the Field.
 
More involvement is necessary.  Every slot in every 
selected project Node should be genned in UNIX and passed
to PA for loading.  This week is your test period, as well
as ours.  We all need to work these systems as much as we
can.  Please generate these slots (even if there is no
change) on the UNIX systems.
 
Any questions or problems can be directed to Phillipe
Michel X7359.

Subject: unix scripts: newuser & newgroup 


Cynthia,

  I fixed the problems with newuser and with the negative uid's for
the order-processing people.  I changed their id's to the 5200 range
just after pi, and their group name from orderproc to op.

All of their directories need to be validated, and this can be done
using newuser.  However, you need to use newgroup first to setup the
group directory for group op.

please login to the unix system and type out:

   man newgroup

and

   man newuser

and then try them out.... also, it no longer matters what host
you are on.  That is why you have to specify the host name to
the newgroup script...

then newuser doesn't need to know that information... just the
name of the group so it can set gid.

leave me voice mail, or unix mail to user carl if you have any more
problems.   I'll be at the fremont data center after 11am, and
asleep till then - note time of this message -

talk to you today.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------




THE BETATEST UNIX WEEK HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL ONE AND WE ARE NOW READY
TO GO FULL SPEED ON THE MIGRATION OF THE PUBLIC NETWORK. THIS
ONTYME WILL EXPLAIN OUR MIGRATION PLAN, SCHEDULE, PROCEDURES AND
HOPEFULLY ALLEVIATE ANY CONFUSION.

PROCEDURES
-----------

WE WILL START GENNING THE 2000 SERIES OF NODES THE WEEK OF 7/10
AND LOAD THEM THE WEEK OF 7/17. IN ADDITION, ALL PROJECTS BEING
LOADED STARTING THE WEEK OF 7/17 WILL BE GENNED ON THE SUNS STARTING
THE WEEK OF 7/10. ALL BACKUP REQUESTS WILL BE DONE ON THE SUNS STARTING
7/10-THIS MEANS THE CS' HAVE TO GENERATE THEIR SLOT CODE ON THE SUNS
STARTING 7/10.

PI  GROUP WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PUBLIC NETWORK NODE CODE, AND THE
FIELD WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL GENERATION OF SLOT CODE ON THOSE NODES.
THE FIELD SHOULD USE THE 'NODE GET/NODE PUT' PROCEDURE ON TECHTIP DIRECTORY.
THE SLOT NIB FILES SHOULD BE GENNED ON THE CS' PERSONAL DIRECTORY AND
THEN ALL SLOT FILES SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE NETLOAD DIRECTORY(SATURN)
AT LEAST (2) WORKING DAYS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED LOAD DATE. IF AT THAT TIME,
THE SLOT CODE IS STILL NOT ASSEMBLED, AN ONTYME WILL BE SENT TO THE CS;
THE PROBLEM WILL BE ESCALATED UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS RESOLVED.

IN SUMMARY, THE CS' WILL GENERATE SLOT CODE IN THEIR HOME DIRECTORY,
PUT IT IN NETLOAD UNDER THE NODE'S DIRECTORY, AND PI WILL TAKE IT FROM
THERE AND PUT IT IN PILOAD. PI WILL GENERATE THE NODE CODE IN THEIR
HOME DIRECTORY, PUT IT IN PILOAD AND AFTER A SUCCESSFUL LOAD, PUT IT
IN TYM(PRODUCTION) DIRECTORY.

BACKUPS WILL NO LONGER BE DONE VIA ONTYME-CARL BALTRUNAS WILL SEND A
SEPARATE ONTYME EXPLAINING THE NEW PROCEDURES. WE WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT
BACKUPS FROM THE PDP-10'S SENT ON OR AFTER 7/10. THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS
IF THE CODE IS KNOWN TO BE NON-COMPATIBLE WITH UNIX IN WHICH CASE THE
CS SHOULD SPECIFY ON THE BACKUP REQUEST THAT THE CODE IS NON-COMPATIBLE.
ALSO, ALL BACKUP REQUESTS ON THE SUNS SHOULD CONTAIN THE T0#,C0#, AND N0#.

SCHEDULE
--------

7/7     DALLAS OPERATIONS MAKES TAPE OF ALL SYSTEM 54/25 FILES AT 15:00 CDT
        AND MOVES THEM TO THE SUNS IN FREMONT OVER THE WEEKEND.

7/10    ALL NEW PROJECTS FOR THE WEEK OF 7/17 IS GENNED ON THE SUNS-
        CS' GEN ALL SLOT CODE INVOLVED WITH THE NODES BEING LOADED.
        
        2000 SERIES NODES ARE GENNED ON SUNS(SEE BELOW)

        ALL BACKUP REQUESTS ARE DONE FROM THE SUNS

7/17    ALL CODE GENNED THE WEEK OF 7/10 GETS LOADED THE WEEK OF 7/17

        3000 SERIES NODES ARE GENNED ON SUNS-LOAD THE WEEK OF 7/24

7/24    4000 SERIES NODES GETS GENNED-LOAD THE WEEK OF 7/31

        ETC. UNTIL ALL SERIES OF NODES GET GENNED AND LOADED

SPECIFIC SCHEDULE- WE BROKE DOWN THE SERIES OF NODES INTO (5) EQUAL
                   SEGMENTS(MONDAY-FRIDAY) TO BE GENNED-THE LOAD WILL
                   TAKE PLACE EXACTLY (1) WEEK AFTER THE GEN. THE 2000
                   SERIES WILL BE THE SAME AS THE OTHER SERIES(2000-2147
                   ON 7/10 AND 3000-3147 ON 7/17,ETC.)

        PLANNED GENS/LOADS

        7/10- 2000-2147 LOAD ON 7/17
        7/11- 2150-2317 LOAD ON 7/18
        7/12- 2320-2467 LOAD ON 7/19
        7/13- 2470-2637 LOAD ON 7/20
        7/14- 2640-2777 LOAD ON 7/21

        7/17- 3000-3147 LOAD ON 7/24
        7/18- 3150-3317 LOAD ON 7/25
        7/19- 3320-3467 LOAD ON 7/26
        7/20- 3470-3637 LOAD ON 7/27
        7/21- 3640-3777 LOAD ON 7/28

        AND SO ON WITH OTHER SERIES....

WHILE THESE SERIES ARE BEING GENNED, NODES RELATING TO PROJECTS WILL ALSO
BE GENNED. THE PI COORDINATOR WILL SEND AN ONTYME/ALLMAIL TO **ALLCCS
TO NOTIFY THE FIELD WHAT ISIS NODES ARE INVOLVED WITH THE PROJECTS. IT IS
IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT BOTH SERIES/NODES AND PROJECTS/NODES REQUIRE SLOT
CODE GENERATED BY THE CS AT LEAST (2) FULL WORKING DAYS BEFORE THE LOAD
DATE. SLOTS NORMALLY GENERATED BY PI WILL STILL BE DONE BY THAT GROUP.

AS A BENEFIT, CARL HAS WRITTEN INFO ON UNIX AND OTHER MISC. FACTS
UNDER THE DIRECTORY TECHTIPS-HE WILL ALSO WRITE NEW PROCEDURES/INFO
AS THEY COME ALONG THIS MIGRATION.

NATURALLY, YOU CAN REACH US DIRECTLY BY SENDING MAIL IN UNIX(MAIL USERNAME),

SUBJECT: UNIX CONVERSION SCHEDULE

PHILIPPE,

I'VE TRIED TO CALL YOU TODAY, HOWEVER, I WASN'T GETTING YOUR
VOICE MAIL....SO I THOUGHT I'D SEND YOU AN ONTYME.

MY QUESTION REFERS TO THE UNIX SCHEDULE YOU SENT OUT FOR
CONVERSION TO UNIX OF THE 2000, 3000 SERIES NODE NUMBERS.

YOU HAVE STATED THAT THE 2000-2777 NODES WILL BE LOADED THE
WEEK OF 7/17, AND THE 3000-3777 NODES WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK
OF 7/24.

AFTER THAT THERE IS SOME CONFUSION.  BY SAYING "AND SO ON WITH
OTHER SERIES...." DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE 4000-4777 NODES
WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 7/31, AND 5000-5777 WILL BE LOADED
THE WEEK OF 8/7 AND 6000-6777 WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 8/14,
AND 7000-7777 WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 8/21, 10000-1?????
WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 8/28.

JACK SNAVELY SENT OUT A SCHEDULE DATED JUNE 12, INDICATING THAT
THE  SERIES OF 4000-5777 WOULD BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 7/31 AND
THAT ALL REMAINING NODES WOULD BE LOADED THE WEEKS OF 8/7 AND 8/14.
ARE WE GOING TO BEGIN COMBINING NODES SERIES AS THE WEEKS GO ON OR
ARE WE TO FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE OF (1) SERIES OF NODES PER WEEK?


COULD YOU PLEASE BE MORE DETAILED IN THE SCHEDULE BEYOND THE
3000-3777 SERIES.   WE WOULD LIKE SPECIFICS FOR EACH WEEK
INDICATING EXACTLY WHICH NODES ARE SCHEDULED FOR WHICH WEEKS.

THANKS FOR YOUR COOPERATION

     Date:     11 July 1989
 
 
     Subject:  Unix Migration Project Meeting Minutes
 
 
     Next Meeting: TBD 
 
 
     Attendence:    J.Snavely      - Network Services
                    D.Murtaugh     - Network Operations
                    H.Matthews     - Program Manager 
                    G.Walker       - Software Tech Support
                    S.Spinale      - ACS and PSC representative
                    P.Whitehurst   - NTD Unix system support
                    P.Michel       - Project implementation 
                    J.Alcantara    - Unix system administration
                    C.Baltrunas    - Unix system support
                    P.Keifer       - Tymnet domestic field rep.

                    T.Kelley       - Network Resources
 
 
     A.  J.Snavely  introduced H.Matthews as  Manager,  Technical  Services 

taking  over  day  to day management of  the  migration  project  reporting 
directly to J.Snavely.
 
 
     B. Problem Escalations
 
1. 3270 SNA, PBH and ACOM sysgen failures reported, "operand error -  range 

out  of bounds". Possible cause - corruption of source code during  PDP  to 
Unix file transfer although this is unconfirmed.  Source code checksums  on 

PDP  and Unix did not match. Source re-copied, code regenned  and  problems 
solved. 
 
 
     Action:   B.Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program that 

compares the PDP and Unix directories after the PDP directory is 
copied  to  UNIX  to  prevent future  problems  of  this  nature. 

Complete date of 12 July is committed by P.Whitehurst.
 
Since all source codes were re-copied, it was recommended that all  patches 

be recopied as well.
 
     Action:  C.Baltrunas  to recopy upon notification from  G.Walker  that 

patch  directories  are  up  to  date.  

2.  Bits  vs.  LOADII  load  time  comparisons.  J.Snavely  reported  field 

complaints  and produced definative evidence that Fremont BITS  takes  much 
longer  than LOADII to load either slots or whole nodes. At this  time  the 

cause of the problem is unknown and several actions are underway to  gather 

more data to isolate the fault.
 
     Action:  It  so  happens that Unix system operators  around  the  S.J. 

campus are meeting on 11 July to discuss optimal X.25 parameters for Sun  - 
Tymnet  interface. G.Walker offered Tymnet X.25 expertise  to  participate, 

which  was  accepted.  If  neccessary, this group will  call  in  Sun  X.25 
support.
 
     Action:  J.Alcantara to re-test Bits load time from NCC  Unix  systems 

using  same  load  strings  as J.Snavely tests  and  compare  results  with 
J.Snavely tests.
 
     Action: H.Matthews to gather results on 13 July and obtain  assistance 

to  analyze results and determine if this has helped us isolate  slow  load 
times. If not, other actions will be taken until problem pinpointed.
 
3. Field Escalations
 
All  problems  related  to  the migration should  be  sent  to  the  OnTyme 

distribution   file  named  ***  SUN.HOTLINE.  The  recipients   shall   be 
C.Baltrunas, P.Michel and H.Matthews with copies to P.Keifer, G.Walker, and 

J.Snavely.
 
NTD, Operations and STS are staffed to handle Tymnet product failures.
 
     Action: Distribution files to be ready by 13 July.
 
4. NAD cannot build circuits
 
After  a  recent, new NAD release to the Suns it is reported  that  NAD  no 

longer builds circuits.
 
     Action:  P.Whitehurst  advised C.Baltrunas to check TYMLIB  setup  and 

contact her should he require more assistance.
 
 
 
     C. Sun System Status
 
1.  All  personal  directories submitted by P.Keifer  were  in  process  of 

transfer to Suns but a System 33 crash prevented completion, tranfers  will 
resume when 33 is stable.
 
     Action:  C.Baltrunas to insure IPC completes the work on the  11  July 

subject to system 33 stability.
 
2. C.Baltrunas provided update on present Fremont systems. 
 
3. P.Keifer commented on difficulties getting Unix validations.
 
     Action: P.Keifer to take the matter up with Validations directly.
 
4. Production cutover proceding per last published schedule. No changes  to 

report.


5. P.Michel stressed PI's need for multiple node gen scripts and  effective 

PI  code back up request procedures to meet the present 100 nodes per  week 
schedule.
 
     Action:  C.Baltrunas to delegate multiple node gen scripts to  J.Smith 

for completion no later than 13 July.
 
     Action:  C.Baltrunas to meet with D.Sakai to put backup procedures  in 

place and insure all field support organizations are notified. Due date  is 
13 July.
 
     FYI: D.Sakai will focus as backup request coordinator.
 
6.  It  became  clear that P.Keifer does not represent  all  field  support 

organizations.   For   example,  PSC  and  ACS.  S.Spinale   is   the   PSC 
representative and agreed to find out whom in ACS can act as a focal point. 
 
     Action:  H.Matthews  to contact S.Spinale in a few days to  learn  ACS 

rep.
 
7. Field Service Company requested ENGDIAGS be transferred to Suns.
 
     Action:  H.Matthews contacted P.Diamond to learn location of  all  FSC 

requirements. Awaiting return call from him.
 
8.  Malvern PA backup systems installation delayed.  Hardware  installation 

date is 13 July then target date to bring the systems to operational status 
is 28 July.
 
It is required that Malvern Unix systems have the same look and feel as the 

Fremont systems. 
 
     Action: C.Baltrunas to cut a backup image of a Fremont system and send 

it to Malvern.
 
     Action: H.Matthews to check milestones on project to interface Malvern 

Suns to Tymnet with D.Sakai.
 
9. Code release process requires further discussion and definition.
 
     Action:  H.Matthews  to interview various interest groups  to  develop 

requirements definition.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



I am having gen problems on the following nodes:

2177 - solo consat
I am not able to gen the solo consat node 2177 at this time because
the cmd file references files that were not copied over to UNIX.
Philippe is having Carl fix this.

2036 - slot 1 - SNA version 3.03
There are 2 problems with this slot.  The source patch file gets an
error of "line: 10 (1) error: Invalid opcode" for the 11th patch.
The checksums on system 25 and unix do not match (source)sna03.p03.
Pam Whitehurst will fix this.
The second problem is that a patch (snapat)posact.tst was not in system
33 and so was never copied over to unix.  I have left voice mail for
Gary Walker about this.


2063 - slot 1 - same as for slot 1 of node 2036.

2377 - slots 2 & 3 - The new version of CMT 7.04 is more efficient and so
does not display the status line as often.  Minnesota Mutual's script file
triggers when the status line message "SNA  APPL" is the last thing
displayed on the first screen.  I have opened escalation 250767 for this.
Richard Ho is investigating.

              FR: ROCK ANDERSON
 
 
              RE:  UNIX GEN PROBLEMS
 
 
              The unix will not gen slot 2 of node 2060.  The
              error message is indicating a bad
              (source)bbxs06.r01 file.  Phil Sneddon told me he
              was aware of the bad source file but thought it had
              been corrected.
 
              It is late in the day Thursday and this node is to
              be loaded Monday evening 7-17.  I will be on
              vacation Friday 7-14.
 
              I have asked Linda (Kaiser) Timme (out of the
              goodness of her heart) to try to gen the code
              Friday and to back it up.  Nobody else in my
              department is trained on the unix method at this
              time.  Linda knows of Phil's involvement, Phil
              knows of Linda's involvement and Phillipe Michelle
              also knows about the problem.
 
 
              ===============
 
              Another issue needs to be addressed.  We have two
              Lemcom machines, Nodes 6114 and 6134.  There are no
              tym or command files for the Lemcoms, only nib
              files.  Joan Kelly and I talked to a Tymnet person
              in Dallas who has four Lemcoms.  He doesn't have
              tym or command files either.  Ed Barens (Dallas)
              was saying that the code was created by NSC (NTD).
 
              The problem is that we must regen the nib file on
              the unix, but I am unable to do so without the tym
              and command files.
 
              EDI has all their traffic going through these
              Lemcoms.  What solution do you propose?
 
 
              I can be reached at 314-233-8570 or via Ontyme at
              ACS.R/ANDERSON.

re: *** Distribution File

An action item from Tuesday's project review meeting was to create a 
distribution file for field escalations during the Unix migration
project. This file is complete and available for use now. It is called
*** SUNESCAL and is available to all Ontyme users in the U.S. and MDISI.

Please forward this information to all your people.

Thanks,

a file has been created in one of my subdirectories called "core".
this file is 2,212,666 characters.  i do not believe i created this
file...maybe inadvertently?  due to the size of this file, i feel
compelled to delete it, but would appreciate some confirmation
as to how it came to be and if i should or should not delete it.

see: gemini/cts/lreynolds/02300/core

thank you,

you may have already thought of this, but....

would it be a good idea to rename ALL NDxxxx.xxx code in the pdp-10's from
ND to UN when the conversion has been completed.  this would hopefully
eliminate any confusion as to whether a node has been converted and
also help avoid having slot code inadvertently or unknowingly copied
over for revisions.

The following slots should not be loaded from the Sun systems next week,
unless the problems mentioned are fixed before the scheduled load day:



node 2060 - slot 2 - This will not gen because of a problem genning BBXS
            (this is Rock Anderson's account)

node 2177 - solo consat - files referenced in the CMD file have not been
            copied over to the Suns.

node 2036 - slot 1 - problems with the source patch file (checksums are
            different from those on the PDP10's)
            
node 2063 - slot 1 - problems with the source patch file (same as above)

node 2377 - slots 2 & 3 - recently revised version of 7.04 causes problems
            for customer.  ticket 250767 is open for this.

SUBJECT:  STATE OF THE UNIX PROJECT

THIS WEEK HAS BEEN A MAJOR MILESTONE FOR THE UNIX CONVERSION.  I AM NOT GOING
TO BELITTLE THE ISSUES WE FACE BUT I KNOW WITH YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT WE WILL
ACHIEVE OUR CONVERSION GOALS ON TIME.  IT HAS TAKEN THE COOPERATION OF BOTH
HEADQUARTERS AND FIELD PERSONNEL TO REACH THIS MILESTONE AND UNCOVER THE
REMAINING OBSTACLES TO THIS PROJECT.  I HAVE RECEIVED COMMITMENTS FROM 
NTD, TECH SUPPORT AND OPERATIONS TO DEDICATE WHATEVER RESOURCE IS NEEDED TO    
CORRECT THE REMAINING PROBLEMS AND MAINTAIN OUR TIME SCHEDULE.  I AM ASKING
FOR A COMMITMENT FROM ALL OF YOU AS WELL.

BY THIS TIME, YOU ALL SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE CHANGES TO THE CONVERSION 
SCHEDULE REGARDING NODE RANGES AND PROJECTS.  WE ARE LIMITING THE NODES
BEING CONVERTED TO UNIX FOR PRODUCTION CODE TO A SINGLE RANGE OF NODES PER
WEEK AS FOLLOWS:

    NODES 2000-2777 - WEEK OF 7/17
    NODES 3000-3777 - WEEK OF 7/24
    NODES 4000-4777 - WEEK OF 7/31
    NODES 5000-5777 - WEEK OF 8/7

PROJECTS WILL NOT BE CONVERTED UNLESS THE NODE NUMBER FALLS IN THE RANGE TO
BE CONVERTED THAT WEEK.

ONCE A NODE HAS BEEN CONVERTED, THE CODE ON THE PDP 10 WILL BE MOVED TO A 
HOLDING DIRECTORY CONTROLLED BY NETWORK CONTROL.  IF YOU NEED TO ACCESS
THOSE OLD FILES FOR ANY REASON, YOU MUST CONTACT NETWORK CONTROL.  THIS
HAS BEEN DONE TO INSURE OBSOLETE CODE IS NOT LOADED INTO THE NETWORK.

IN ADDITION, A FILE IS BEING CREATED ON THE UNIX SYSTEM TO TEACH THE
LOCATION AND PRODUCTION CODE FOR EVERY NODE IN THE NETWORK.  THIS FILE
WILL BE UPDATED, REAL TIME, BY NETWORK CONTROL AS CODE IS LOADED AND STABLE.

THE MAJOR REMAINING ISSUES ARE:

  - BUILDING CIRCUITS FROM NAD - THIS IS NEEDED FOR TROUBLESHOOTING
    IN THE FIELD.  PAM WHITEHURST IS WORKING THIS ISSUE.

  - BITS LOADING TIME EXCESSIVE - MAJOR IMPACT IF A SITE GOES DOWN
    AND NEEDS RELOADING.  PAM WHITEHURST IS HEADING A TEAM TO RESOLVE.

  - BACK-UP SYSTEMS IN MALVERN - SYSTEMS ARE HARDWARE INSTALLED AND
    EXPECTED TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL BY THURSDAY (7/20).  CARL BALTRUNAS
    
  - CONTENTS OF FIELD PERSONAL DIRECTORIES - THESE HAVE BEEN MOVED BUT
    NOT YET DISTRIBUTED.  THIS WILL BE COMPLETED TODAY (7/14).  CARL
    BALTRUNAS

  - PVC CODE MISSING FILES - FILES ARE MOVED BUT NOT YET DISTRIBUTED.
    THIS WILL BE COMPLETED TODAY (7/14).  CARL BALTRUNAS

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BACK-UP SYSTEMS (TARGETED FOR 7/20) THE LIST SHOULD
BE CLEAR BY MONDAY.  AS IN THE PAST, ANY PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED SHOULD BE
ESALATED TO PHIL KIEFER FOR FIELD PERSONNEL OR HARRY MATHEWS FOR HQ AND PSC.

ONCE AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION TO DATE AND ASK
THAT WE JOIN TOGETHER WITH RENEWED ENERGY FOR THE NEXT FEW EEEKS TO MAKE THIS
PROJECT SUCCESSFUL.

              I sent you an Ontyme Thursday, 7-13 concerning a
              BBXS slot I was unable to gen.  That was Node 2060,
              slot 2, version BBXS06.C01.  As of this morning, I
              am still unable to gen the slot.  This node is
              scheduled to be loaded tonight.  Please do not load
              this node.
 
              Node 2430 is scheduled to be loaded Wednesday,
              7-19.  I am unable to gen slots 1, 2, and 3.  Slots
              1 and 2 are BBXS code and I am getting the same
              error as Node 2060, slot 2.  Slot 3 is HSA version
              IHSA01.C06.  This version does not appear to be in
              the Source directory.
 
              I come in through the Titan Server and my ID is
              randerso.  I can be reached at 314-233-8570.

SUBJECT>   Today's new release by NTD of NAD and BITS


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Today, NTD has released new versions of NAD and BITS for the Public Net Suns
that is reported to fix several outstanding faults. Since these faults, among
other issues, has halted implementation of the Unix migration I request
an immediate release of this software to Fremont so I can begin testing.

Although I ask for an immediate release I do not wish to by-pass the QA
function. I ask for the immediate release 1. because of the reason I gave above
and 2. because it is my understanding that the QA Unix systems
are running 3.5 SUNOS whereas the Public Net systems are running 4.0.
I am concerned that QA is not able to test this release under the same 
operating enviroment as the Public Net. In fact, one of the fixes
now released solves a problem only evident under 4.0, not 3.5.

Please reply to let me know if you can test NAD and Bits on some other Sun
in Bubbnet running SUNOS 4.0, if this can be tested before next Wednesday and
when the QA Suns willl be upgraded for SUNOS 4.0.

              RE:  UNIX GEN PROBLEMS
 
 
              The unix will not gen slot 2 of node 2060.  The
              error message is indicating a bad
              (source)bbxs06.r01 file.  Phil Sneddon told me he
              was aware of the bad source file but thought it had
              been corrected.
 
              It is late in the day Thursday and this node is to
              be loaded Monday evening 7-17.  I will be on
              vacation Friday 7-14.
 
              I have asked Linda (Kaiser) Timme (out of the
              goodness of her heart) to try to gen the code
              Friday and to back it up.  Nobody else in my
              department is trained on the unix method at this
              time.  Linda knows of Phil's involvement, Phil
              knows of Linda's involvement and Phillipe Michelle
              also knows about the problem.
 
 
              ===============
 
              Another issue needs to be addressed.  We have two
              Lemcom machines, Nodes 6114 and 6134.  There are no
              tym or command files for the Lemcoms, only nib
              files.  Joan Kelly and I talked to a Tymnet person
              in Dallas who has four Lemcoms.  He doesn't have
              tym or command files either.  Ed Barens (Dallas)
              was saying that the code was created by NSC (NTD).
 
              The problem is that we must regen the nib file on
              the unix, but I am unable to do so without the tym
              and command files.
 
              EDI has all their traffic going through these
              Lemcoms.  What solution do you propose?
 
 
              I can be reached at 314-233-8570 or via Ontyme at
              ACS.R/ANDERSON.

              RE: UNIX GEN PROBLEMS II
 
 
              I sent you an Ontyme Thursday, 7-13 concerning a
              BBXS slot I was unable to gen.  That was Node 2060,
              slot 2, version BBXS06.C01.  As of this morning, I
              am still unable to gen the slot.  This node is
              scheduled to be loaded tonight.  Please do not load
              this node.
 
              Node 2430 is scheduled to be loaded Wednesday,
              7-19.  I am unable to gen slots 1, 2, and 3.  Slots
              1 and 2 are BBXS code and I am getting the same
              error as Node 2060, slot 2.  Slot 3 is HSA version
              IHSA01.C06.  This version does not appear to be in
              the Source directory.
 
              I come in through the Titan Server and my ID is
              randerso.  I can be reached at 314-233-8570.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after PDP
                to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned that
                UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled twice,
                whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked to 
                assemble patches twice an operand out of range error is
                reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

            1.A.3  Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations 
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

            B.  Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.

                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

            1.B.3  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match settings
                                 recommendations of informed UNIX system 
                                 operators around the San Jose campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a 
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

            1.B.4  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for 
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that 
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

            C.  Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for 
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

    II.     ***  Distribution file named SUNESCAL is ready on MDISC
            Internal Ontyme systems for Field questions or escalations
            pertaining to SUN/UNIX migration matters.

    III.    Personnel Directory copies between PDP and UNIX is complete.
            Further file transfers are the responsibility of the
            individual using the Net Copy program.

            3.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

    IV.     Patch directory copy to UNIX is complete.  Further file
            transfers are the responsibility of STS.

            4.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

    V.      P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            5.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 7/14/89.  No feedback since.
                                 Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to think
                                 about allowing background jobs to run
                                 slower then they presently run.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to recontact J. Smith to learn
                                 of this progress on the program.

            5.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas has made progress in program
                                 specification and further progress is
                                 pending successful installation of
                                 Malvern back up system, so that when back
                                 ups are completed on Fremont SUN, the
                                 backup program automatically updates TYM
                                 and CMD files to Malvern SUN.

            5.1.C  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to develop program that
                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated
                                 completion is 28 July 1989.

            5.1.D  Action: 7/14  Due to the anticipated volume of 
                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

                                 C. Baltrunas to implement program
                                 controlled method in conjunction with
                                 point 5.1.C.

                   Update: 7/24  See update point 5.1.C.

    VI.     It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            6.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

            6.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            6.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            6.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            6.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.
                                 Matthews.

                                 R. Ferguson also reports that T. Kochman
                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUNs.

    VII.    Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 7/24  Network connections to Malvern SUN's
                                 installed and operational three days
                                 ahead of agreed to schedule after it was 
                                 discovered that a new dual Mini Engine
                                 was needed.  Great work Lisa Baker and Ed
                                 Kalinowski, thanks!

                                 C. Baltrunas working with T. Kane of NSSC
                                 to bring the SUN's to a fully
                                 operational, ready to use state by
                                 Friday, 28 July 1989.

    VIII.   T201 Software gen problems were reported by P. Kiefer on July
            11, 1989.

                   Update:  No further reports from Field.  Item closed.

    IX.     Exceptions to node range 2000-2777 for UNIX conversions was
            discussed as being nodes with PASCAL Software, Lemcoms, disks
            or tapes and nodes outside the continental U.S.A.  These nodes
            will be migrated after standard Tymnet nodes are done.

                   Action: 7/14  NETQA to provide list of all PASCAL
                                 nodes, nodes with disks or tapes and
                                 Lemcoms.

                   Update: 7/25  Complete.  Information forwarded to P.
                                 Michel.  Item closed.

    X.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, thru one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETUAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    XI.     D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen
            procedures to Netcon.

                   Action: P. Michel to provide informal hands-on training
                           and document the code gen procedure prior to
                           his departure for Paris.

    XII.    Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 

            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

    XIII.   SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

    XIV.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

    XV.     UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

    XVI.    Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - code distribution via unit
            systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

    XVIII.  Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

    XIX.    It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC0) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As of today new versions of BITS and NAD resides on the Public Net Sun
systems which reportedly fix several faults. In order to test
these programs prior to restarting the Unix migration I request your help.

I require that you instruct your people to gen and load as many lab nodes and
test slots as possible on Monday and Tuesday using the newly released programs.
The objective of this test will be to restart field involvement in the program
to generate and load on those two days as many products as possible.
Please report any faults to *** SUNESCAL.

A second phase of the field involvement in the pre-production test is to
submit slot code for the following node numbers by Wednesday:

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after PDP
                to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned that
                UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled twice,
                whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked to 
                assemble patches twice an operand out of range error is
                reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

            1.A.3  Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.  Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.

                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

            1.B.4  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.8.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

            C.  Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

            D.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

    II.     Personnel Directory copies between PDP and UNIX is complete.
            Further file transfers are the responsibility of the
            individual using the Net Copy program.

            2.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

                   Update: 7/28  NETQC was not present at the meeting, but
                                 since there is another escalation it is
                                 considered complete.

    III.    Patch directory copy to UNIX is complete.  Further file
            transfers are the responsibility of STS.

            3.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

                   Update: 7/28  Misreported, no problem.  Item dropped
                                 from minutes.

    IV.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            4.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to recontact J. Smith to learn
                                 of this progress on the program.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.

            4.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas presently working on
                                 program, will be ready by 1 August.

 

            4.1.C  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to develop program that
                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated
                                 completion is 28 July 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Program to be ready 1 August.

            4.1.D  Action: 7/14  Due to the anticipated volume of 
                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

                                 C. Baltrunas to implement program
                                 controlled method in conjunction with
                                 point 5.1.C.

                   Update: 7/24  See update point 7/28 4.1.C.
   
    V.      It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            5.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - AES - now participating.

            5.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            5.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            5.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            5.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon

                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.
                                 Matthews.

                                 R. Ferguson also reports that T. Kochman
                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.

    VI.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 7/24  Network connections to Malvern SUN's
                                 installed and operational three days
                                 ahead of agreed to schedule after it was
                                 discovered that a new dual Mini Engine
                                 was needed.  Great work Lisa Baker and Ed
                                 Kalinowski, thanks!

                   Update: 7/28  One Malvern system still experiencing
                                 hardware problems.  SUN to dispatch on 31
                                 July.

    VII.    It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, thru one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VIII.   D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen
            procedures to Netcon.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to provide informal hands-on
                                 training and document the code gen
                                 procedure prior to his departure for
                                 Paris.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel to complete by 1 August.

    IX.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

    X.      SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh to respond by next meeting.

    XI.     Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

    XII.    UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

    XIII.   Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

    XIV.    Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XV.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.

                   Action: 7/28  A.    J. Smith to document.
                                 B.    P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

    XVI.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

Present status as of 9AM Tuesday 2 August of recent NAD and BITS releases.

Operation genned 10 nodes via the new NAD on Monday, Netcon loaded Monday 
evening. All 10 loads failed with acircuit zapper message. P.Whitehurst had
her support person visit Netcon on Tuesday afternoon to witness several load
attempts, which failed also.

On Tusday morning, Pam reported that not only does BITS circuits get
zapped but other Unix outbound call circuits get zapped as well. Pam to get
XCOM assistance from G.Walker and system support from C.Baltrunas

At present it is unclear why circuits are being zapped.

Mary, can you inform me when QA will complete release tests on the new NAD
and BITS that was simultaneously released to QA and the Public Net last
week? Perhaps the problem we are experiencing right now is due to different
enviroments in BUBBNET and Fremont.

Eric, the permissions were not setup correctly yesterday. The were reestablished
today so the problem should not be there anymore. We are enabling an
automatic way so this function will not have to be done manually any longer.

I want to thank those field techs that have tested the new release of NAD
and BITS. Without field accpetance tests of these programs we will
not get this program restarted. Keep genning and loading all the test slots 
you can. Even though BITS has another known problem (error code 51)
some other interesting points have come from your feedback.


I would like to hear from PMTS about genning and testing your interfaces
and FSC on validations and loading of diagnostics.

Thanks,

Prior to Carl Baltrunas departing for two weeks hard earned vacation time I 
want to call a program review meeting. Time is 2 pm to 3:30 pm on Tuesday 8 
August in conference room C5-645 (the usual place).

The purpose is to smooth the transition for the interim system support being
provided by Joe Smith (FSC) and Osman Guven (Neteng) in Carl's absence.

Beginning at 3:30 will be a report by D.Hopkins on his evaluation
of USECURE, a Unix security package. If you receive this message you're invited.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after PDP
                to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned that
                UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled twice,
                whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked to 
                assemble patches twice an operand out of range error is
                reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


            1.A.3  Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.  Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.3  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

            1.B.4  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This

                                 from minutes.

    IV.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            4.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                                 of this progress on the program.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.

                   Update: 8/4   L. Reed is satisfied she knows how to use
                                 this script.  She'll use this script for
                                 node gens during test period.


            4.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas presently working on
                                 program, will be ready by 1 August.

                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated

                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

                                 C. Baltrunas to implement program
                                 controlled method in conjunction with

    V.      It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            5.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - AES - now participating.

                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            5.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            5.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            5.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.

                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.


                   Update: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VIII.   D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen
            procedures to Netcon.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to provide informal hands-on
                                 training and document the code gen
                                 procedure prior to his departure for
                                 Paris.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel to complete by 1 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Michel had meeting with a Netcon rep.
                                 item closed.

    IX.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

    X.      SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh to respond by next meeting.

    XI.     Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guvan and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    XII.    UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.


                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

    XIII.   Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

    XIV.    Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XV.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.


                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.

                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

                   Update: 8/4   A. -  Need banner message and update Tech
                                       Tip file for completion.
                                 B. -  Closed.
                                 C. -  C. Baltrunas - incomplete.
 
    XVI.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 Bits release.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                                 since there is another escalation it is
                                 considered complete.

    III.    P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            3.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to

                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.

                   Update: 8/4   L. Reed is satisfied she knows how to use
                                 this script.  She'll use this script for
                                 node gens during test period.

            3.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas presently working on
                                 program, will be ready by 1 August.

                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated
                                 completion is 28 July 1989.

    IV.     It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            4.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            4.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            4.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            4.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.

    VI.     It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VII.    D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen

                                 training and document the code gen
                                 procedure prior to his departure for
                                 Paris.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel to complete by 1 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Michel had meeting with a Netcon rep.
                                 item closed.

    VIII.   Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.



                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

    IX.     SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh to respond by next meeting.

    X.      Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guvan and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    XI.     UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

 


    XII.    Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

    XIII.   Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XIV.    It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.


                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point

                                 C. -  C. Baltrunas - incomplete.
 
    XV.     PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release.

re: BITS escalation

The attached message arrived as a result of field testing of the 7/28 release
of BITS. I am unsure if he has sent this to you directly but I wanted to be
sure you are aware of it so I am sending it myself.

Please review and let me know if he has found something new.

I've been beating on Bits and have come across an interesting bug that you
may or may not know about.  When trying to do a multiple slot load, bits
fails thinking that its been given a bad object file.  The error is
repeatable but is dependent on the nature and order of the files.  A
transcript of the error follows.  The engine used, which is in my lab, is
node 2731.  Slots 2 and 4 are TII gateways, slot 3 is a Tymcom, and slot 5
is X.PC.

One other thing I find annoying is not being able to cleanly abort bits
before the load starts, e.g. at a filename prompt.  Consider the case where
you specified the wrong slot number and want to abort.  Hitting
control-c eventually gets you out but with a core dump.

________________________________________________________________

Additional delay is apparent.  Present bits problems are the
only cause now.  I'll report more on present status later, but
first, I want to provide you with the framework on a migration
schedule once we begin migrations.
 
Week 1, Day 1 - Nodes 2127, 2143, 2146, 2167, 2207, 2211,
                2335, 2424, 2404, and 2407.
 
        Day 2 - Node Range 2011 - 2047.
 
        Day 3 - Node Range 2050 - 2125.
 
        Day 4 - Node Range 2126 - 2200.
 
        Day 5 - Node Range 2221 - 2342.
 
Week 2, Day 1 - First 100 nodes in the 2342 - 4000 range.
 
      Day 2-5 - 100 nodes per day.
 
Weeks 3 through 10 - 100 nodes per day, 500 per week.
 
After 10 weeks of migration, we shall turn-off systems
25, 54, and 33.
 
One week ahead of time, myself, with assistance from PI, will
announce the definative range of nodes to be converted, giving
7 days notice.
 
At least for the first 2 - 4 weeks, the only nodes that will be
converted are Public Net nodes located in the Continental U.S.
excluding nodes in Subnets, ACS, FSC, PMTS, and nodes with 
peripherals (disks and tapes).  Therefore, I urge those people
involved with customers and/or products on the (temporary)
exception list to think about and document your plans and
requirements to me so that we can look after our customers.
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
PRESENT STATUS - CK node, Look, Get, Unget and Put programs
are available for use.  A system banner message provides a 
pointer to a man page on how and when to use the utilities.
 


Please continue to test using present releases of NAD and
Bits - IT HELPS!  Also, the backup systems in Malvern are
installed and operational.  Please log into these systems
and test that they have the same "Look and Feel" as Fremont
and everything operates as it does on Fremont.

1. Malvern host numbers are 10655 and 10663.
2. MAN pages for prgrams are now in place.
3. Banner messages are now in place.

Points 2 and 3 were simply timing matters, my OnTyme was sent prior to this
work being done.

re: BITS 2.10 release dated 8/8

The BITS release received yesterday failed again. I scheduled 10 campus
nodes for reload and again, all 10 failed to complete the loads. The same
error message for all failed loads was communicated to you by L.Reed today.
For those on the CC list benefit the reported error was

re: Copying file to other UNIX directories

Please copy .cshrc file to ../.../.cshrc then request all CTS users to copy
from ../.../.cshrc to their own directory and name it .cshrc

this should do it, although it is klugy. After we get the migration moving
in a orderly manner I will assign system programmers to the task of making
system improvements. This is a candidate.

If you have any difficulties, re-submit and I'll get one of my support people
to work with you on it.

re: Reported NAD problem

Several weeks ago before the most recent NAD release it was reported that NAD
did not build circuits used for debugging. A new release of NAD dated 7/28
was supposed to fix this problem. I would like field tech confirmation that
it is fixed. Please test and reply.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.


                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.

                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommended that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release and so will observation
                                 of nodes failing to come up after Load.

                   Action: 8/8   NTD made a second release of Bits (2.10
                                 dated 8/8/89) to Program Management on

                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.

            D.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    II.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            2.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.

                                 that this program is ready prior to
                                 restarting the project.  It is of
                                 critical importance.

                   Update: 8/8   Item complete.  C. Baltrunas instructed
                                 PI how to process update (name changed
                                 from backup) requests.  C. Baltrunas

            2.1.C  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to develop program that
                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated

                   Action: 8/8   J. Smith to instruct Netcon how to update
                                 the node conversion list program.


            2.1.D  Action: 7/14  Due to the anticipated volume of 
                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are


                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.

                                 R. Ferguson also reports that T. Kochman
                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 7/24  Network connections to Malvern SUN's

                                 Fremont System images.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.





                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

    VII.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on Usecure
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefullness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissable programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 exceute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

    IX.     Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

 


    X.      Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XI.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.

                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

                   Update: 8/4   A. -  Complete.
                                 B. -  Complete.
                                 C./D. Baltrunas - complete.
 
    XII.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HARRY,
 
   I HAVE FOOLED AROUND WITH NAD AND WE ARE INDEED ABLE TO BUILD CIRCUITS
TO THE KERNELS FOR RUNNING DIAGS. HOWEVER, THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME OTHER
BUGS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT.
 
   1) THE PROCESS IS A BIT SLOW COMPAIRED TO THE PDP-10'S BUT I FEEL THIS
      NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.
 
   2) ONCE YOU'RE INTO THE SLOT THE ONLY COMMAND THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO
      WORK IS "::?HIST". WHEN IT IS ISSUED THE CIRCUIT GETS ZAPPED.
 
   3) WE ARE ABLE TO LOG INTO EXTENDED DDT BUT ARE UNABLE TO ISSUE ANY
      COMMANDS ONCE THERE. THIS SEEMS TO BE TRUE NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF
      INTERFACE YOU'RE LOGGED INTO. THIS WILL CAUSE MAJOR HEARTBURN
      AMONG US CS TYPES.
 
 
   IF THERE IS ANY THING I CAN DO OR ANY TESTING YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO
PERFORM JUST LET ME KNOW.
 
 
 
 
                                                BEST REGARDS,
 
 
                                                DAN...

When performing a directory listing the year is not shown because all present
files on the Unix systems were created this year. If you execute a 
directory command and there are files created in previous years these will
be shown.

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.


                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

                   Update: 8/8   Bits release dated 8/8/89 failed.  NTD
                                 witnessed loads and made changes.

                   Update: 8/16  Bits release dated 8/16/89 failed.

                   Action: 8/17  UNIX team members will witness Bits
                                 testing in Netcon tonight.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.


                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommended that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/17  This change will take place after 24
                                 August.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release and so will observation
                                 of nodes failing to come up after Load.

                   Action: 8/8   NTD made a second release of Bits (2.10
                                 dated 8/8/89) to Program Management on
                                 Tuesday afternoon.  C. Baltrunas to
                                 install in Fremont on Tuesday evening.
                                 L. Reed to instruct Netcon to Load the
                                 ten (10) campus nodes, using Bits dated
                                 8/8/89 and report results.  Also, Netcon
                                 to do timing tests on same three nodes as
                                 was performed three (3) weeks ago.
                                 Report results to H. Matthews on 9
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/17  Alleged Bits speed improvements yet to be
                                 verified as last two Bits releases have
                                 not loaded nodes.  Furthermore, the
                                 report that some nodes do not come into
                                 Network after Bits loads remains
                                 unverified.


            C.   Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                 required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.

            D.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    II.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

                   Update: 8/17  Item Closed.



    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

                   Update: 8/17  Validations waiting signed individual
                                 security agreements before validating FSC
                                 on SUN Systems.


    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.
                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

    VII.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is


            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on USECURE
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefulness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissible programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 execute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

                   Update: 8/17  NTTR.

    IX.     Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.


                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.
 
    X.      Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XI.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Update: 8/17  Complete, item closed.

    XII.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release and loading problems are
                                 resolved.


   XIII.    J. Smith or O. Guven to train Netcon how to use the CKnode
            Program.  This will be scheduled prior to live migration.

SUBJECT>   New mass edit programs for CONSAT


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This memo documents the release of three new mass edit programs to
update the SOLO CONSAT and ISIS CONSAT command files and tymfiles.
All of these programs take as input a node number list file. The
following table lists the program name, function, and input file name:
 
    PROGRAM	     FUNCTION		     INPUT FILE NAME
    =======	     ========		     ===============
1. CMDSOL.SAV	MODIFIES SOLO COMMAND FILES    CMDSOL.DIR
2. TYSOL.SAV	MODIFIES SOLO TYMFILES	       CMDSOL.DIR
3. CMDSIS.SAV	MODIFIES ISIS CONSAT FILES     CMDSIS.DIR
 
Contact Abe Mendez for more information on the use of these programs
for the Tymnet nodes. Please do NOT use these programs without
checking with Abe first!!!
 
To run each program type RUN followed by the program name and press
the enter key; e.g for the solo consat :
 
		      RUN CMDSOL
 
will fire up CMDSOL.SAV, which will read node numbers from the
CMDSOL.DIR file. The CMDSOL.DIR file can contain a list of nodes like:
 
			 3106
                                                                Page  2

			 3144
 
The limit on the number of nodes is currently about 20,000.
 
Both CMDSOL and TYSOL share the same input file, CMDSOL.DIR. The
CMDSIS program requires a separate input file, CMDSIS.DIR .
 
These input lists can be used repeatedly for more modifications later
if we need them.  We can also move them to the UNIX environment later
as input files for the UNIX tools (yet to be developed).
 
I have tested the above 3 programs, and they work fine. They will not
damage already modified command files / tymfiles. Abe has
already used CMDSOL (the Solo Consat program) successfully.
 
Please call if you have further questions.
 
Best Regards,
 
K.L.Narayan
