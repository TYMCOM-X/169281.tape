We are sending the following memo to you as managers in the license tree.
Please ensure that all users under your management comply.

The Validations Department is in the process of updating our current infor-
mation on employees who have status names.

We appreciate your cooperation, and we hope you understand that this is a
necessary step to improve the security of our Network. Basically, it will 
provide accountability, and will give us immediate access to the person that
owns the status name.

This security enhancement is particularly significant in light of the recent
unfortunate publicity about Tymnet Security practices. Call me (X7316) if
you'd like a copy of the article.



We are requesting that anyone who currently has a status name, run our exec
** license.req. This exec will prompt you for the information that we need
in order to update our files. It will be available on or before 12-12-88.

People who have not provided the required information by January 13,1989,
will be barred from setting license after that date.

Node 6760, the base for our 2020 host X14, has been upgraded from an LSI-11/03
to an 11/23.  I didn't even have to change SV6760.BND - it loaded the old code
with no problems.  The node has 2 lines running at 9600 baud, the line to
neighbor node 5561 is active with no errors.

The line to neighbor node 5416 is suspended because that node has no XLINKs
and is not configured to talk to node 6760.  We cannot really exersize this
configuration unless TYMNET changes the TYM file for node 5416 and adds an
additional TIILNK for 6760.

Wayne & Vida & Cynthia,

As I said I would, I have rolled the opername data base into the new system.

However, there is still some amount of testing, and a small matter of making
sure that the license kept on the system password file is not lost.

I also have made all of the programming changes as per our conversation on
Thursday.  As per that meeting, I have noot been felling as well as I would
like and have not done what I consider sufficient testing of the new features
added in the last week.

I will call you (Cynthia) sometime this afternoon to discuss having you do
some "stress-testing" to make sure nothing will break when we make this live
for all users on the system.

PS. Since I am developing on system 33, that is where the current TEST system
resides.  I will move it to 74 today, so I may fix anything that you find
without breaking anything else.

PPS.  Wayne, I would prefer that Cynthia do some amount of double-entering
      using one of these test systems.  I will coordinate with her when and
      where she can start.

PPPS.  Wayne, I do not have the correct ONTYME address for either Cynthia or
       Vida.  COuld you please put a copy of this memo on their desks.

Thanks a lot.

Subject: Analysis of TRW's MAPAL1 crash. 

LOGINN was running and did an INBUF uuo which caused the low-seg to be
expanded to handle the input buffers.  The kernel did a VCREAT uuo, asking
for 2 writeable pages starting at user virtual page 2.  One page was
allocated and a second one contiguous to the first was requested.  The
MAPAL1 occured when PCBIO was asked to read a bogus SAT page for SWAMP.

Something went wrong in GETPAG while allocating the first page.  It returned
200004,,467125 which is an error; the highest page on an RP06 is 227161 octal.
The bogus disk address was found in ac M and in the UPT and UPT+UPTLMA.
When GETPAG was called the second time, is took the bogus disk address,
calculated the address where the STT would be if the disk had that many
pages, and read random garbage as an STT entry.  It read this garbage as
if it were a retreival pointer and passed it on to PCBIO.  The MAPAL1 crash
is a result of RBREAL not being set on this garbage pointer.

There was no bounds checking in the GETSTT routine in SWAMP.  I put in a
check against UNIPAG.  This will fix this particular MAPAL1 scenario but
until the problem in GETPAG is found, bad data can still get put into the
UPT.  That will cause a PAGPOR (page out of range) stopcode when the page
is faulted in.

I have not checked the logic in GETPAG to find out why it could return a
bogus value.  It may have been that the very last SAT page of the last
unit was in-core and completely full (and the routine fell off the end
of DSKB).			/Joe

Subject: re: TOPS-10 FIle being modified (3) 

Joe,
  I setup FACT.CTL to submit FCTLOG.CTL for /after:+0:05 just before it
finishes.  FCTLOG.CTL simpley renames FACT?.LOG to FACTn.LOG where n is
increased each time it runs, making FACT.LOG ==> FACT1.LOG.

  Well, normally I'd expect this to work... but it doesn't.  It gets the
file being modified error.

  Background:  I foolishly [?] tried having this rename occur while inside
FACT.CTL and (of course, received FIle being modified (3) as the error).
This was earlier this afternoon.  I created FOO.CTL and submitted it as:
  SUBMIT FACT=FOO.CTL/...     then
  SUBMIT FACT/TIME:10:00/UNIQUE:0/AFTER:3:00   to run tonight...

Anyway, I just logged in and FCTLOG ran 5 minutes after FACT completed and
still got the File being modified error.  I tried it by hand, nearly an hour
after BATCON finished running FACT and I got the File being modified error.

Who has the file open?  Why?  Is this a bug in 7.01?

Please take a look at FACT.LOG and FCTLOG.LOG DSKB:[1,2] on KL#1300
I'd ultimately like to have the FACT.LOG for each day printed and then

me to check, otherwise I'd just have BATCON delete it after printing.
I don't want to print an ever-increasing FACT.LOG every day, but I do
want to print it every day for their benefit!

  Instead of calling it "License" it is now called "Capability" and is

At 00:05 I tried to TAUX to XRAY:8671 to look at X32's base from F33.
It kept saying "access barred".  I tried from X14, which said "no such host".
I tried from D25, and got a long delay.  Trying to build a new circuit from
the mux produced "ISIS unable to complete request".  That's when I realized
it was 3 very different symptoms of the same problem.  The SUP took over

the TAUX on D25 finally got through.

     I have been working for some time to upgrade the security features
     of SETOP.  It is fi now being implemented.  Although we have
     tried to make the upgrade as transparent as possible, part of that
     plan is to have all of Network Systems under Network Systems
     control.  Therefore, TYMNET Validations will manage SETOP functions
     for Network Systems.  You all still have your own manager functions,
     as before, but now with more flexibility.  The only added control is
     at the time a new user name is added.  That function will go through
     an audit by TYMNET Validations to insure proper information is in
     the database (of course, we are working the current "cutover
     problem" of getting all existing names and owners in the database).

of any individual opername on the current branch.  If the user is not
a manager, then the only one the user can change is his/her-self.

Subject: SETOP :: OPPS 

Vida & Cynthia,
  As per our discussion on Friday, OPPS has now been modified to allow
users to change their OPER passwords and update the NEW setop data files.
OPPS is now ONLY on system D34.

  A possibly new feature is that a manager need not run SETOP just to
change a user's OPER password, whereas previously you were only allowed
to change your own password with OPPS.  It now validates the user by
requesting an opername and password, then allows the user to change any
opername that is on that user's particular branch.

I looked at GFD.MAC and it appears that someone put in the code to prevent
GFD to SYS: (who knows when) only one problem... it gets the SYS: ppn using
INIT and DEVPPN... why a problem?  DEVPPN skips and they stored the result
in SYSPPN at DEVPPN+1 so the later compare always checked against [0] and
never worked.

Fix: In GFD %14.7, add JFCL after DEVPPN call.  Telecopied to (OSU:*) Please
install if you notice that I've missed it.

after getting KL10 Halted a number of times trying to reboot the system
he decided to swap hardware from DDD to FFF.

F74 on FFF is now running full dskcln with no apparent problems (as of this

Ali beleives the problem is somewhere in the CPU...SA10 path since FFF is
not having any problems.  Anyway, since it it presumed to be HARDWARE, we
are off the case until further notice.

We were called prior to Ali's notification that F74 was running dskcln. I

As we had thought, SETE both in the monitor and the program had been
updated.  However, (SYS)SETE.SAV was version %11.  I suspect that the
change was made (2-Dec-87) and never put on SYS because we hadn't put
up the new monitor anywhere except on our test system(s).  Then it was
overlooked.

I will telecopy it everwhere (OSU:*)SETE.SAV, although the source is (MPL).
This is a monitor utility and belongs in (OSU) due to it's nature.

that says what we do.. Not just SUPPORT, we are software engineers, so we
should publish that fact, make the company realize that we think, design,
create, (in effect: engineer) and provide support, hand-holding, etc....

Please, no flames... I don't remember our exact "real" name anymore, I mean

Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behalf" of another user.

What causes POSSIBLE COMPILED CODE-RUNTIME INCOMPATIBILITY?
I ran into it trying to rebuild MAILER.SAV from (TUMS)MAILER.CMD.

Date: Tue, 7 Feb 89 3:58:49 PST 
To: Joe Smith <JMS> 
Subject: Re: RUNTIME IN-COMPATIBILITY 

Well... it's like this, FTSYS:SAIL and SYS:SAIL produce identical code at
the moment, however it has NOT always been this way.  There is ONE major
factor that separates these two released versions of SAIL.  They have a
different compiler/runtime version number assembled into them.

Thus, when you link code that has been compiled with one or the other
together, there is this little INIT procedure that gets called at runtime
which makes sure we're all using the same runtimes by checking what version
each module was compiled with.

Whenever it finds one that doesn't match, it complains... unfortunately, it
was never made to understand to tell the poor user what the version numbers
or what modules are at fault.

In NDT, Scott had a program which printed out these version numbers, but it
would take some work to locate it and fit it into TUMS.

To complicate matters, any "require" files that reference (SAILIB), have
an other set of idiosyncracies... they have compile-time switches that check
the compiler version and they attempt (and are 95% right) to load the library
.REL file that matches the right compiler versions.  That's why you'll find
APPEND.REL and APEND.REL, etc... See (SAILIB)SAIL.DEF for some gore... esp.
see the section on get!module or get!library...

Either one or more of the library versions do not match.  Check your RPG.INI
to see what version of SAIL you are using to compile with... Bill may have
used a different version.  Usually (FTSYS) vs (SYS) is the biggie.

Subject: Re: Setting LICENSE of F33 

Um.. my fault actually, F33 is my test host for the new SETOP program and
I turned the switch to only write validated OPERnames to the password file.

My fault, because the database I was using was a 2-week old base that didn't
have any (read *ANY*) users validated properly with their ISC employee numbers
so, although everything was written correctly on D34, when I exited my test
copy on F33, it clobbered the real file with stale data.

You had an opername that had 0 license.  Since you said O... without asking
for explicit licenses, it said, oh.. you want, let me see.. nothing, OK! and
set nothing(!) so it didn't complain, 'cuz your password and all was alright.

The other problem is that it would fix itself when the password-file daemon
runs, but that happens to be every 150 minutes (read 2.5 hours).  I got a
call from operations and I fixed it!

FYI... the newest latest greatest version is this hour now running on D34.
       It is a little kinder about some things, and now enforced the TYMNET
       password standard of nothing trite, nothing short, nothing without
       an embedded non-alpha, etc...                  (up 2, "d" should be "s")

Carl,
  Ron and I were playing with SETOP and had a few questions that don't seem
to have obvious answers.
  What is BM capability?  Is it anything like SM?
  How does someone get LG capability?  People like Ed Mooring (license name
ETM) have traditionally run much of the oper stuff for us and QA, but he
doesn't have LG.  Does he even need it to continue to manage existing names
and their licenses?

I had operations "STORE G3" on B39 and restore on X32 with "MODE OLD NEW" so
that system 32 should have the most recent files.  I'm sure F74 is not up
to date.

I don't know if B39's packs are still mounted; you'd have to ask the Fremont
Data Center.  If not, you could have them restore (SAILIB) from B39's final
all-files tape to some other directory on X32 or F74.

1. is 39 still up somewhere (i.e. 39's packs)?
2. any idea on problems with PEAK, still getting complaints.  Error code

Subject: NODE 7004 UPGRADE 

GENTLEMEN,

    I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THE TYMCOM-X GROUP STILL DOES THE
PDP-10 BASE CODE GENERATION. THERE IS A PROJECT #47582 TO REMOVE A 9.6
HARDWIRE AND INSTALL A MEMORY SHUFFLER LINK FROM NODE 4261 TO EBUS
NODE 7004. THE PROJECT LISTS THE BOUND FILE IN THE TYM5 DIRECTORY IS TO
BE LOADED INTO 7004 BUT I NOTICED THE NW7004.BND FILE IS ONLY 63 PAGES
LONG AS COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL 69 PAGES FOR EBUS NODES. I WOULD APPRECIATE
YOUR RESPONSE ON THIS WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE. THE PROJECT IS TENTATIVELY
SCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15TH AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE SURE
THE CODE FOR 7004 IS GOING TO WORK TO BE SURE HOST 31 ISN'T DOWN ANY
LONGER THAN NECESSARY.

    SO TO SUMMARIZE, NODE 7004 NEEDS THE CODE TO LOOK FOR MS LINKS FROM
SWITCHERS ND4261 AND ND5405. THE HOST INTERFACE SLOT SHOULD NOT
NEED TO BE CHANGED BUT I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT TO DECIDE HOW

THE CODE SHOULD BE SET UP.

THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR COOPERATION
LUCIEN FRANSCINI (ONTYME FSC.L/FRANSCINI)

Yes, we support the EBUS base code.
I updated ND7004.TYM to have 2 SIO lines and 0 SYNC lines.
The new BND file is (TYM5)NW7004.BND on F33 and D54.

  Does LPR on the PDP-10s accept any switches?  if so, what switches?

I typed "LPR ?" but it of course tried to spool file "?" which isn't there.

Osman was to have a monitor made for F33 for use on 3652's and let me

3652's from 3675's this weekend.  Can anyone shed some light on this?

Cheryl,
  In an effort to clean up various OPER names without ISC numbers and to
avoid confusion in the future, some specific opernames have been transferred
or cancelled.

  Opername "LICENSE" has been withdrawn from the list of legal opernames
since it conflicts with one of the internal keywords of the new SETOP
program and as such, I have removed it from your branch.  If someone in
your group was actually using that opername, pleas contact Cynthia in the
validations department to obtain a new opername.

  Sorry if I've inconvenienced you or your group... this is all in the
interest of security and to reduce confusion for the future.

Vida & Cynthia

  As per our conversation yesterday about allowing a <RETURN> to cause
someone's capabilities to be taken away, I have fixed that problem in
release %1(104) of SETOP.

  A second problem, was that some people are running SETOP and then not
exiting when they are done.  These jobs cannot be killed by operations
since they are setup to intercept ^C (or ESC) and the kill-job interrupt
from the system.  I've also fixed this problem and instutited a 10-minute
timeout.  Anyone running SETOP and not typing anything at command level
for over 10 minutes will be thrown out of SETOP.

  THis is NOT a new behavior.  The old SETOP had a 1-2 minute timer.

If you find any more problems with SETOP please let me know.  I'll give
you both a call in the morning to prep you with the ramifications of my
two changes.

I've tested both changes extensively before putting %1(104) on (SYS), so
there should NOT be any otehr problems.

Subject: LapTop and dial-up 

Craig,
  I don't know if you've used TERMITE, but that isone of the two out-dial
packages available with the software we received with the lap-tops.  The
TERMITE program is either on the FSCO LAPTOP disk or the LOAD FILES disk.
I've already moved files around on the hard-disk to make the space more
manageable (a directory fits mostly on the screen, in each sub-dir) so I
cannot be sure what directory TERMITE is in.

with TERMITE it's almost as easy as TYMCOMM:

You say:  TERMITE terminal-type port-# speed<cr>
   eg:    TERMITE HP2621 2 2400<cr>


The other package is PROCOMM nd it's a bit more complicated.  I've not
yet looked at it.  It seems I copied the DOC files, but forgot to copy
the .EXE file for KERMIT, so I haven't been able to see how well it works.

I'll let you know more later...

 PS  I'm typing this mail from the laptop.

Subject: Laptop battery life 

Craig,
    Have you used the laptop for any length of time to find out how long
the charge on the battery lasts?  I expect that the dual-floppy version
lasts longer than the hard-disk, but I was wondering...  I've not let the
laptop sit without touching it for more than 12 hours.  Each time, the
battery dropped below what was needed for the hard-disk & system within
2-hours, then I plugged it into the AC and used it for a few more hours.

It's flashing "low bat" at the moment,... again, less than 2-hours off the
battery (stand-alone).

I think the laptop is probably one of the best ideas FSCO has come up with.
I'd gladly trade in my HP2621 (Since TERMITE can emulate it) for the laptop
with the hard disk.

I'd like to see if we can get an external hard-disk that plugs into the
back of the laptop that can accept the IBM 5 1/4 inch floppies.  Then it
would be truly portable and we could install and run any software that
we have on the XT... (although we couldn't use both the external disk
and a parallel printer simultaneously)...

I'm going to copy VP-EXPERT or/and LEVEL 5 to the hard-disk tomorrow (Monday)
along with dbase3 for investigation of designing a data structure to hold
the Sun call-in data that Osman is collecting.

One thing we can do... immediately... that is prepare the equivalent of CFB's
on sun problems and put in a simple menu-driven CFB reader.  Talking to Raucher
about his plans for such a reader of the current 2-disk CFBs should be useful
for us as well as for him.

Gotta run... don't expect the blinking battery light to last much longer.

	    -- Butler

Subject: LUD/DUL problems 

Julian,
  I've looked over the code in (SSVALSUP)UPDLUD.MAC and it appears to do
all the right things for reading and writing LUD and DUL entries in terms
of allocating and using overflow blocks.

  I saw no indication as to what may have originally caused the problems
you saw on system 74 other than the fact that some of the older programs
which access the LUD sequentially (such as LETTER) do NOT handle the case
of overflow blocks correctly.


  We have put in a temporary fix to LUD.SYS which appears to solve all of
the problems with LETTER.  There is a new version of (SRAVAL)USERS both in
directory (SRAVAL) and in directory (CARL).  If the version in SRAVAL seems
to be looping forever, try the version in CARL.  If both appear NOT to be
working, please give me a call.

  The problem was:

    a userid was added which needed to be placed in an overflow block.  Both
LETTER and USERS read LUD.SYS sequentially and when they read the first word
after the last good entry in the non-overflow block, they read:

       400000,,001257       and both said:  non-zero? Yes, get entry size
                            from word+2 and that was = 0 !!!  So, it then
                            incremented the pointer by 0, and read the same
                            entry again and again....


  Anyway, in any programs you write using the LUD, if the first word of an
entry is negative, then the right-half is the block number to read to get
the next entry.


  Since the LUD and DUL were restored by operations to a previous day, some
of your information for useval/tymval no longer co-incide with the data on
the system.  Please run your consistancy checks and fixup any entries that
are missing from either the LUD or DUL.  

  Then re-run the consistancy checks... you should NOT have to delete any
UFD's, since they should NOT exist yet, or if they do, they have been used
already and you want to keep the current information stored in them.




Let me know if you have any more problems.   /Carl

Subject: TURBO MEETINGS, ETC. 

I have the following items of information that you need to be aware of.

        - There will be a brief Turbo meeting Fri., 3/10, in F - 655 at 3:00.

        - There will be a meeting to review Turbo limitations on Mon., 3/13,
          in F - 655 at 1:30.

        - QA will be responsible for two documents regarding Turbo.

                One is the document that goes out with the release of
                Turbo reporting the results of our tests.

                Two is a document which states the
                limitations of Turbo at a high level.
                (Example: There must be at least one SIO link to
                 the Turbo for loading.)

The second document will be the topic of discussion at the Monday meeting.
Please bring to that meeting a list of the limitations you can
identify for your product and any others you are aware of.  This is not a 
composition test.  Bullet items will do.

Mary,
  I did not receive/read your Ontyme about Friday's meeting until late on
Friday... 

  This next week, I will be away taking an Intensive C class offered by the
UC Santa Cruz Extension in Santa Clara 9-5pm.  If we need to get together
please send me mail:
    on antares:  carl, or doctor!carl
    on PDP-10s:  carl@F74     (this also works from antares)
    on Ontyme:   TXS.C/Baltrunas

This means I will not be at the meeting on Monday 3/13.  I will let Joe
know about the meeting (he should also have gotten your mail) and depending
on his schedule, I expect he will be at the meeting.

-Carl

PS.  Have you heard anything more about the release of TEFS?  Mar 3 has
     come and gone, and Joe and I are still waiting for the 1.10 release.
     As of friday 3/10, I have not heard anything.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


These are some additional duties I have been trained to do on the TYMCOM-10's
by Software Support:

     SPOOL
     -----

     Fixing "CANNOT FIND FD" errors

     Duplication of requests

     Running MONTHLY SPOOL maintenance software


     MISSING OR INCONSISTENT PACK SET ID's
     -------------------------------------

     Occurs when a host goes down when one or more unit(s)
                                                                Page  2

     is/are off-line.

     Occurs when using DM 30:1 if one or more unit(s)
     are not on-line when taking the system down.


     ASH (Absolute Structure Hash)
     ---

     To track page errors that may occur asynchronously (unexpected
     or unpredictable) to the buffer/record reading loop.

          
          This program causes THUNGS to incremnt and BP's to report
          being HUNG.

     Purpose:  To determine if unit is BAD (needs replaced) or if
               ZFORMATTING will clear up unit(s).


     NOTE:  When this software is running, it puts a heavy load
            on the system.

No, that is why I was asking about B39, I figured Bill was WRS@BUFFALO

DENCOFF is moved to the public net, I think 33.. not sure about anyone
else.  I'll ask Wayne on thursday for their new address.

As you may have noticed in my previous posting, I've invented a new name
for our group.. in between Host Support and Network Host support.. but one
that says what we do.. Not just SUPPORT, we are software engineers, so we
should publish that fact, make the company realize that we think, design,
create, (in effect: engineer) and provide support, hand-holding, etc....

Please, no flames... I don't remember our exact "real" name anymore, I mean
I use it so often... sigh!

Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behalf" of another user.

Subject: Re: RUNTIME IN-COMPATIBILITY 

Well... it's like this, FTSYS:SAIL and SYS:SAIL produce identical code at
the moment, however it has NOT always been this way.  There is ONE major
factor that separates these two released versions of SAIL.  They have a
different compiler/runtime version number assembled into them.

Thus, when you link code that has been compiled with one or the other
together, there is this little INIT procedure that gets called at runtime
which makes sure we're all using the same runtimes by checking what version
each module was compiled with.

Whenever it finds one that doesn't match, it complains... unfortunately, it
was never made to understand to tell the poor user what the version numbers
or what modules are at fault.

In NDT, Scott had a program which printed out these version numbers, but it
would take some work to locate it and fit it into TUMS.

To complicate matters, any "require" files that reference (SAILIB), have
an other set of idiosyncracies... they have compile-time switches that check
the compiler version and they attempt (and are 95% right) to load the library
.REL file that matches the right compiler versions.  That's why you'll find
APPEND.REL and APEND.REL, etc... See (SAILIB)SAIL.DEF for some gore... esp.
see the section on get!module or get!library...

Either one or more of the library versions do not match.  Check your RPG.INI
to see what version of SAIL you are using to compile with... Bill may have
used a different version.  Usually (FTSYS) vs (SYS) is the biggie.

    Have you used the laptop for any length of time to find out how long
the charge on the battery lasts?  I expect that the dual-floppy version
lasts longer than the hard-disk, but I was wondering...  I've not let the
laptop sit without touching it for more than 12 hours.  Each time, the
battery dropped below what was needed for the hard-disk & system within
2-hours, then I plugged it into the AC and used it for a few more hours.

It's flashing "low bat" at the moment,... again, less than 2-hours off the
battery (stand-alone).

I think the laptop is probably one of the best ideas FSCO has come up with.
I'd gladly trade in my HP2621 (Since TERMITE can emulate it) for the laptop
with the hard disk.

I'd like to see if we can get an external hard-disk that plugs into the
back of the laptop that can accept the IBM 5 1/4 inch floppies.  Then it
would be truly portable and we could install and run any software that
we have on the XT... (although we couldn't use both the external disk
and a parallel printer simultaneously)...

I'm going to copy VP-EXPERT or/and LEVEL 5 to the hard-disk tomorrow (Monday)
along with dbase3 for investigation of designing a data structure to hold
the Sun call-in data that Osman is collecting.

One thing we can do... immediately... that is prepare the equivalent of CFB's
on sun problems and put in a simple menu-driven CFB reader.  Talking to Raucher
about his plans for such a reader of the current 2-disk CFBs should be useful
for us as well as for him.

Gotta run... don't expect the blinking battery light to last much longer.

/Carl

			      MARRIAGE HUMOR



       Mostly from ``Another Almanac of	Words at Play'', by Willard
       Espy.

	  + ``It doesn't much signify whom one marries,	for one	is
	    sure to find out next morning it was someone else.'' --
	    Rogers

	  + ``If you are afraid	of loneliness, don't marry.'' --
	    Chekhov

	  + ``The most happy marriage I	can picture would be the
	    union of a deaf man	to a blind woman.'' -- Coleridge

	  + ``Were it not for imagination, sir,	a man would be as
	    happy in the arms of a chambermaid as a duchess.'' --
	    Dr.	 Johnson

	  + ``If a man hears much that a woman says, she is not
	    beautiful.'' -- Haskins

	  + ``A	man does not look behind the door unless he has
	    stood there	himself.'' -- Du Bois

	  + ``A	lover tries to stand in	well with the pet dog of
	    the	house.'' -- Moliere

	  + ``Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing; a
	    confusion of the real with the ideal never goes
	    unpunished.'' -- Goethe

	  + ``In matrimony, to hesitate	is sometimes to	be saved.''
	    -- Butler

	  + ``A	woman may very well form a friendship with a man,
	    but	for this to endure, it must be assisted	by a little
	    physical antipathy.'' -- Nietzsche

	  + ``Men who cherish for women	the highest respect are
	    seldom popular with	them.''	-- author unknown

	  + ``Woman inspires us	to great things, and prevents us
	    from achieving them.'' -- Dumas

	  + ``Nature has given women so	much power that	the law	has
	    very wisely	given them little.'' --	Dr.  Johnson

	  + ``The great	question... which I have not been able to
	    answer... is, "What	does a woman want?''  -- Freud

	  + ``Home life	as we understand it is no more natural to
	    us than a cage is to a cockatoo.'' -- Shaw


	  + ``Marriage is like a cage; one sees	the birds outside
	    desperate to get in, and those inside desperate to get
	    out.''  -- Montaigne

	  + ``For a male and female to live continuously together
	    is...  biologically	speaking, an extremely unnatural
	    condition.'' -- Robert Briffault

	  + ``Marriage is low down, but	you spend the rest of your
	    life paying	for it.'' -- Baskins

	  + A wedding is a funeral where a man smells his own
	    flowers.

	  + A man is not complete until	he is married -- then he is
	    finished.

	  + Marriage is	a rest period between romances.

	  + Marriage is	the sole cause of divorce.

	  + Marriage is	a trip between Niagra Falls and	Reno.

	  + Marriage is	an institution -- but who wants	to live	in
	    one?

	  + Marriage is	the process of finding out what	kind of
	    person your	spouse would have really preferred.

	  + Marriage is	the triumph of imagination over
	    intelligence.  Second marriage is the triumph of hope
	    over experience.

	  + Marriage is	not a word; it is a sentence.

Subject: TURBO MEETINGS, ETC. 

I have the following items of information that you need to be aware of.

        - There will be a brief Turbo meeting Fri., 3/10, in F - 655 at 3:00.

        - There will be a meeting to review Turbo limitations on Mon., 3/13,
          in F - 655 at 1:30.

        - QA will be responsible for two documents regarding Turbo.

                One is the document that goes out with the release of
                Turbo reporting the results of our tests.

                Two is a document which states the
                limitations of Turbo at a high level.
                (Example: There must be at least one SIO link to
                 the Turbo for loading.)

The second document will be the topic of discussion at the Monday meeting.
Please bring to that meeting a list of the limitations you can
identify for your product and any others you are aware of.  This is not a 
composition test.  Bullet items will do.

These are some additional duties I have been trained to do on the TYMCOM-10's
by Software Support:

     SPOOL
     -----

     Fixing "CANNOT FIND FD" errors

     Duplication of requests

     Running MONTHLY SPOOL maintenance software


     MISSING OR INCONSISTENT PACK SET ID's
     -------------------------------------

     Occurs when a host goes down when one or more unit(s)
                                                                Page  2

     is/are off-line.

     Occurs when using DM 30:1 if one or more unit(s)
     are not on-line when taking the system down.


     ASH (Absolute Structure Hash)
     ---

     To track page errors that may occur asynchronously (unexpected
     or unpredictable) to the buffer/record reading loop.

          
          This program causes THUNGS to incremnt and BP's to report
          being HUNG.

     Purpose:  To determine if unit is BAD (needs replaced) or if
               ZFORMATTING will clear up unit(s).


     NOTE:  When this software is running, it puts a heavy load
            on the system.

              TURBO ENGINE SYSTEM INTEGRATION TEAM STATUS REPORT

7:48AM  3/20/1989
Current Events
--------------
1) We spent friday configuring the system with an X.25 slot on GP.130, which
   is connected to another X.25 slot in 4013.  The intent is to benchmark the
   X.25 product and prove or disprove the claim of 5000 cps of user data 
   capacity for a Turbo.  We still have yet to set up Thruput host slots,
   but we do have virtually everything else configured.  With a little luck
   we will produce X.25 capacity figures by end of day today.

Problems/Issues
---------------
1) There seems to be a "wall" at around 170 packets per second.  Although the
   machine still seems to have cpu capacity at this level, we cannot induce it
   to build more packets.
2) IOC-8 ports have proven unreliable and unstable.  Any attempt to place even
   a small amount of traffic on these ports results in ports going into a state
   where the node code thinks they are transmitting packets but they are not.
3) Sync lines (Tymsync) are unstable, and exhibit similar behavior as IOC-8
   ports, even on an IOC-4.  We observe the correlation between issues 2 and 3 
   with Alain's open NSRs.

NOTES AS PER MARCH 2, 1989 PROGRAM REVIEW:

(1)  Slippage due to NTD delays including LTD.  In addition on 
     4/17/89 NTD predicts Single Node Code + X.25 will be 
     released with known and documented deficiencies.

(2)  Pending SAS sales status. 

(3)  Performance figures will include Single Node Code, X.25 only, 
     Single Node Code + X.25 and multiple GPs with Single Node 
     code and serveral X.25s.

(4)  Slippage due to use of machine for UL and FCC.

(5)  Turbo-Engine will be able to run in a virtual sub-net upon 
     initial release.  However, billing by port numbers (should 
     this be desired) will be impossible until MIS modifies billing 
     software to accommodate different port number format utilized 
     by Turbo-Engine.

Subject: F74 has reached limit on number of user names. 

Carl: Anything new on solving Validation's problems yet?

Osman+Craig: Vida Stafford and Julian Min have been having problems adding
new users to F74.  The hash algorithm for both the LUD and the DUL state
that overflow blocks are to be allocated when a block fills up.  It appears
that only system 74 has enough users that blocks are full.  Carl and I have
identified one problem in the LUD that caused programs such as (SYS)LETTER
and (CUD10)USERS to go into an infinite loop when an overflow pointer was
encountered.  This was a case in which programs that create new users in
the LUD and locate users in the LUD worked right, it was programs that
read the entire LUD were broken.

Now the problem is in the DUL.  It looks like ALL of the programs that
write to the DUL are broken.  Only recently have there been enough user names
on a single system to exercise this bug.

Subject: LUD/DUL problems on system 74 

Julian,
  I have looked at UPDLUD.MAC and it appears to know how to update both the
LUD and the DUL.  I have NO way of testing it... do you?  (I recall there used
to be a version called UPDTST, that has a human interface instead of the 
program interface that UPDLUD has).

  In the mean time, I have created a source for (CUD10)ADDDUL.SAV and added
code to handle creation of overflow blocks when adding an entry to the DUL.
Please run this program to fixup all the users that you previously tried to
enter and then were unable to add to the DUL.  I would do this but I only
have a partial list:

    Users reports the following:

	!run users
	Reading DUL...LUD...MFD...Done!

	LUD entries missing DUL entries:

	UFD entry without LUD and DUL entries:
	  1  10056 406405  JJCISMAIL                   

    Please insert these entries by hand with ADDDUL and then we need to test
UPDLUD.  I will talk to you about arranging a time for me to stop by the data
center to do this testing.

    At present, other than the inconsistancies shown above the LUD and the DUL
meet the specifications we have set for TYMCOM-X.  I see no apparent reason for
WHY you cannot enter userids using TYMVAL/USEVAL and UPDLUD, so something else
must be broken in your interface.

Subject: UPDLUD and LUD/DUL problems 

Julian
  I believe that I have located ONE of the sources to the problems that
have been occurring with UPDLUD.  Apparently, some routines call a function
FINDUL to locate an entry in the DUL block.  This routine assumes that it
will find one of:
       An empty entry,
       The specified entry,  or
       An overflow block pointer

  and what is happenning is that the block is full, but no overflow pointer
has yet been created and the function will loop throughout all of it's data
area uchecking every third word for a zero or negative number before it will
get out of the loop.

  Please look at UPDLUD and the routines DULADD, FINDUL, DULFRE and NONE to
see this interaction.  There may be other areas which have this same *bug*
but this is the only one that I found looking at the code.


  Also,
    I have created a source for (CUD10)ADDDUL.SAV and added code to handle
DUL overflow blocks correctly when adding a new user to the DUL.  The new
version has been dispatched via a telecopy job to all PDP-10 hosts, so I
would appreciate it if you or one of the members of your group would run
ADDDUL to add the missing entries to the DUL.  RUN "USERS" to get a list
of the PPNs, and I believe that you and Mai have the rest of the info on
the userids.  (Since Landa is in class).


Joe:  Note... I retracted the earlier mail I sent by logging into ONTYME and
      canceling it, presumably before anyone else read it.

Julian:  The routines in question are on pages 17 & 18 of the UPDLUD program.
         FINDUL should have some check to make sure that C is less than 177
         or it should return an error.  DULFRE has such a check, and apparently
         is the correct place to go if you are trying to CREATE a new entry.

/Carl

PS.  IF you need any additional help in correcting the problems with the
     validations software, please let me know.

PPS. At this pont, both the LUD and the DUL on system 74 appear to meet the
     specifications for entries in normal and overflow blocks.  There are NO
     broken pointers or garbaged data as of the writing of this message.

Subject: LUD DUL problems on F74 

Craig,
  This is to let you know that the problems with F74's DUL are NOW fixed.

  The problem I reported to Julian was indeed the culprit, and has been
rectified in his UPDLUD program (by me).  We also located a second problem
with the ADDDUL program, which was corrected this afternoon while I was at
the data center.  We re-entered the missing entries using the new code and
all is well.  (A copy of the LUD and DUL are in FTSYS).

Subject: SYSDAT 

Carl,
  i tried syssho on 33, only to find that sysdat wasn't running.  I tried
starting it, but may not have done so correctly.  I also checked 25, and
it wasn't running there because (SRA)SYSDAT.SAV doesn't seem to exist...
  MSO came and took my 3/110, so i am back to 3/50.  before they came,
i got the Fujitsu sort of working:  the controller would say that it
was formating, but with a lot of errors.  later checks showed that the
headers of cylinder 0 were not (what i thought to be) correct, so some-
thing may not have been seeking correctly at all.  the drive deteriorated
yesterday to the point where diag kept saying that the drive wasn't ready,
although the drive ready lights were on.  then it wouldn't let me boot off
the SCSI drive, so i removed the xylogics controller, got the SCSI working,
re-installed the xylogics controller, and it still wouldn't work (couldn't
find the fujitsu drive).  I think we need to reassemble the xylogics con-
troller and put it in a server (Ron's new one may arrive next week) and see
if the controller is any good before playing further with the disk.

I can set status inside SPOOL.  (SYS)NONAME and (FTSYS)NONAME both recognize
when I type in a wrong password, but when I type in the right password, it
acts like it can't see the bit that must be set for a quota change.

Subject: Re: "What is starting CRON on TTY5""... 
In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 31 Mar 89 7:24:58 PST

The CRON program reads (SYS)CRON.CTL and executes particular programs at
specified times.  In some cases, it is more reliable than SUBMIT/XEXEC when
it comes to logging in programs that run at system startup.

It is named after the cron program on Unix.  When you get your Sun manuals,
look up cron in section 8 and crontab in section 5.  It's worth knowing about.

Dear Landa,    
     
We would ask you to check the data for TACKSCOMM (CID 17161; GAN 32513;    
UUN 311704) in March.    
     
When we have isuue the tymcomm accounting processing, we found the    
problem data for TACKSCOMM.   
The content is as follows;    
     
1. The data is for 00:12 , 22 of Mar 89' (PST) and 00:12, 29 of Mar 89' (PST)   
   ,and for service code 155 and 154.   
     
2. The quantity of service code 155 is too much as compared with the quantity   
   of service code 154 at same time.    
     
   DATE       START TIME (PST)       QTY of 154      QTY of 155     Spool NO    
----------  --------------------  ---------------  --------------  ---------    
89/03/22           00:12             655.000         1975.512        74659 
89/03/29           00:12            1266.000        15260.524        74689 
     
3. As you know, we had the same problem before and we requested to check   
   the data for TACKSCOMM with my ontyme (#M17863 and #M19633).  
     
As we can give you the information of the spool request number in this time,    
please check the data and inform the investigation as soon as possible.    
We are looking forward to your prompt reply. 
If you have any question please contact me.  
     
Best regards,  
Ikuko Abe

It crashed with a page fault in the middle of the page fault handler.
It could be a software problem - the information stored in the crash
dump is ambiguous.  Even if it is a hardware problem, I doubt very much
that an FE would find anything wrong.  Especially since the system has been
up for almost 24 hours.   /Joe

EXECX is not processing the queue on X17.  I think it may have had something
to do with a bogus date.  One time I brought up the system and it thought
the year was 1995.  Does EXECX refuse the process the present if the future
has already been?  That is, is there a problem if the current date/time is
in the past with respect to anything in JQUEUE.SYS?   /Joe

 master  set.    The PAL changes are usually coupled with other board rework
 and are infrequent.
 
 Maps of the boards can be found in the  individual  manuals,  such  as  the
 "Tymnet  Turbo-Engine  Board  Description  File  Server  Board Description"
 manual.

                        RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
          (Based on the information available as of April 18, 1989)
 
 
 The Turbo-Engine as it is being released can be installed as  a  Node  Code
 switcher,  or  as a X.25 switcher.   The known deficiencies listed below do
 not prevent the successful configuration and implementation of  the  system
 in  this  capacity.    Testing has verified that the GP card in conjunction
 with the IOC4 has met and exceeded the design performance estimates.   (See
 the section below on performance.)  A system has been up and running in the
 public  network  over  the  last few weeks without experiencing hardware or
 software crashes.   This was accomplished using both V.35 and V.24  connec-
 tions  to the Node Code running at 56K and 19.2K respectively.   Subsequent
 releases will complete the product specification.
 
 Part  of  the  initial  specifications   indicated   that   the   following
 features/products would be a part of the first release:
 
           Turbo System Control Program
           ISIS68K
           MultiNode Code
           XCOM
           Capability to connect 256 ports
           Performance of 3000 packets per second through node code
           Performance of 1500 packets per second through XCOM
 
 The  following  sections  will  group the deviations and limitations QA has
 identified into functional deviations, features that have not been formally
 tested and are therefore not considered to be a part of the release, opera-
 tional deviations and differences  from  more  familiar  products,  support
 issues, maintenance issues, security issues, safety issues and performance.
 Performance numbers and recommended line configuration will be addressed in
 a separate memo.
 
 For information on known problems, see the NSR reports.
 
 
 
 I.         Functional  Deviations/Restrictions    (To be addressed in future
           releases)
 
           The number of GPs per chassis for this betatest is limited  to  6
           plus an additional GP as a file server.  This impacts capacity in
           that  it  limits the amount of data that can be optimally handled
           by the configuration to that of the available GPs.
 
           MultiNode Code,  while coding is complete,  is not available  for
           betatest due to conflicts with scheduling the testing.   This af-
           fects performance due to a reduced  amount  of  processing  power
           that can be directly applied to handling data for Node Code.   It
           is anticipated that this feature will be released in version  5.5
           around July 1, 1989.
 
           Sync on IOC4 and IOC8 is not supported with this release.
 
           It  is  important  to note that while the IOC's have a switch in-
           dicating that the board  can  be  swapped  while  the  system  is
           powered  on  and  running,  there is a risk of system failure and
           loss of data during this exchange.    Hot swap of cards in a  run-
           ning system is not supported .
 
           During  an  SCLP load,  the IOC board may hang and may have to be
           manually reset.
 
           Backup will not occur if the system clocks on the GP's differ  by
           any amounts of time.
 
           Running the Turbo as a diskless system is not available.
 
           When  loading  through  an SCLP link,  no other simultaneous load
           should be attempted through the same neighbor.   NOTE:   Neighbor
           for SCLP loading requires TII 5.44.
 
           Backup  may  not  occur  in  the  event of a software or hardware
           failure.
 
           Memory available for slots in a single GP is approximate and  may
           vary  from  approximately  800K to 1 meg depending on system con-
           figuration.
 
           Dynamic reconfiguration will not allow for  the  addition  of  GP
           boards.  You cannot reference a board that is not defined in Sys-
           con.
 
 
 II.        Features Not Formally Tested for Turbo
 
           X.75 gateway
           TII gateway
           LogII
 
 
 III.       Operational Deviations/Differences
 
           A.    BITS vs. LOADII
 
                All of the following statements regarding BITS apply equally
                to  the Turbo-Engine and the Engine family.   The BITS  dif-
                ferences from LOADII also occur with utilizing BITS to  load
                Engines.
 
                When  using  BITS  through  multiple TII gateways,  BITS may
                timeout before responses are received.
 
                BITS doesn't work through an X.75 gateway.
 
                If neighbor access fails, BITS will not retry.
 
           B.    NAD68K vs. NAD
 
                Interactive debugging of slot code by building an  aux  cir-
                cuit through N68K, is not available.
 
                When genning with NAD68K the user should be especially care-
                ful to watch for overlapping segment error messages.   These
                errors will not abort gens as they did when running  NAD  on
                the PDP 10's, and the user may feel the gen was successful.
 
 
 IV.        Support
 
           The  set of file commands available through BITS is limited,  and
           there is no session interface for the file server.  Therefore, it
           is important that individual(s) responsible for loading  a  Turbo
           node keep manual records of directories and files on disk.
 
           In order to read the system boot strategy, BITS must be used.
 
           Five  simultaneous  KIO  circuits,  which  include both local and
           remote access, are available in each Turbo node for debugging and
           support.  In order to preserve KIO circuits,  access XRAY through
           Node Code.
 
 
 V.         Maintenance
 
           If  the  log  file is deleted from the disk,  a new CIRCULAR file
           must be manually created.
 
           Care should be exercised when inserting  paddlecards  to  prevent
           pins from being bent.  If pins are broken or permanently damaged,
           the  slot  can  no longer be used for IOC cards.   Repair at this
           point means replacement of the backplane.
 
           It is important that the clock options in  the  IOCP,  which  are
           changeable through the Operations Monitor,  are in agreement with
           the physical strapping of the paddlecard.  If changes are made to
           the clock options,  it is likely that a dispatch to the node site
           to change the paddlecard strapping will be required.
 
           The only indication of power in an individual chassis, other than
           the position of the power switch,  is the LED's on the individual
           IOC cards.
 
           Caution should be taken when inserting cards in a chassis.
 
                If a GP and paddlecard are inserted in the same  slot  there
                is  a  danger  of  electrical  damage  on one or both of the
                cards.
 
                If an IOC is plugged into the slot where the disk  drive  is
                attached, the disk will be damaged.
 
           To  ensure  proper  cooling,  all  unpopulated  slots should have
           filler panels.
 
 
 VII.       Security
 
           When connected to the Turbo-Engine using BITS,  anyone  can  boot
           the GP cards and perform file operations.
 
           A local user through TTYB or a remote user can boot the GP cards,
           reconfigure  the  system  or  disconnect  any existing user using
           force connect.
 
 
 VIII.      Safety
 
           Breakers are calibrated for 100 AMPS.   This presents a potential
           for severe damage to the Turbo-Engine before the breaker trips.
 
 
 IX.        Performance
 
           File  transfer  to  the Turbo using BITS is slow.   The following
           transfer rates for loading code have been gathered by QA in their
           test environment.
 
                o   Turbo load to disk through KIO          290 cps
                o   Turbo load to disk through SCLP         290 cps
                o   Turbo load to memory through KIO        297 cps
                o   Turbo load to memory through SCLP       299 cps
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 X.         Warnings and Recommendations
 
           1)    If you are connected to the  Dispatcher  in  extended  debug
                mode  and  you issue an ISOM "TR" command,  the chassis will
                crash.
 
           2)    While  in  a  slot's  extended  debugger,  entering  cntrl-O
                (letter "O") to flush data may zap the circuit.
 
           3)    While  in SKYSAP,  typing a connect or force connect command
                with missing or invalid arguments may zap your circuits  and
                hang the boards.
 
           4)    Booting  with  the  "z"  option will remove the booted board
                from SCPG's inventory and the board's patron  may  not  come
                up.   Please review NSR's for other identified problems when
                booting.
 
           5)    It is recommended to terminate all BITS  sessions  with  the
                "Q" command to eliminate possible circuit clean up problems.
 
           6)    Disable  clocks  on  unused lines to prevent checksum errors
                and HDLC aborts.  This eliminates GP and IOC time being used
                to process error.
 
           7)    Do not open back chassis panel when machine is powered up.
 
           8)    Logical units definition in the Syscon file must be  sequen-
                tially ordered starting at 0.
 
           9)    With  SIO.E  option  turned  on in X.25,  data transfer with
                large packet sizes (2048/4096) will result in a  link  reset
                and  ultimately  in a disconnect.   This limitation does not
                extend to the Engine environment.
 
 The current versions of the Turbo-Engine V.35  paddle  card  are  not  com-
 patible with V.35 modems or interfaces commonly used in the Public Network.
 I am referring here to the V.35 A/W 420292-001 rev "A",  "B" and "C" paddle
 cards which do not comprise bi-directional Tx clock drivers  and  therefore
 cannot accept an external transmit timing from a Modem.
 
 A work around defined by ECO # 88-331 (for rev "B") was incorporated on the
 rev "C" with some minor changes (hardwired connections replaced by pins and
 jumpers).  It allows the V.35 paddle card to work with external clocks only
 in case of hardwired connection as it has not showed any  reliable  results
 in case of a Modem connection.
 
 The  rev  "B"  or "C" boards will be used for betatest awaiting for the new
 A/W rev "D" boards which will be able to support Modem connections.
 
 NTS recommends the following V.35 configurations for betatest:

Subject: SET LINE EDIT OFF fixed TUMSGATE. 

Cliff Achord <M178816@SLVMCL1> changed the PROFILE for TUMSGATE to
include the line SET LINE EDIT OFF.  The message that had the line
ending with "#."  went thru OK instead of being translated to
newline-period-newline.  There was one TMS message that looked like it
was using "###" in a place that could use 3 blank lines, but they'll
have to live with it until X.400 is operational.

I did see the binary exponential backoff working when the "already
logged in" error was returned, but not when the Crash routine was
called.  That's because Crash("?LOGON:  unexpected prompt") does not
increment RETRIES when it does a "goto CrashRestart".  (Only creaux
failures and ALREADY LOGGED ON failures affect RETRIES.)  RETRIES needs
to be a global integer instead of an own integer so that Crash can
increment it.

No,
  I have not re-rrun the data through the summary and reporting programs yet.
(been too busy with trying to cope with repartitioning the systems in fremont)

  If you call her, btw she has voicemail too, you can tell her that the data
is being collected, I just have to do sume stuff with the summary batches
before I restart it and I haven't gotten to it yet.

I typed out MSGLOG on D25; it indicated that the last 2 RCCBAD stopcodes
were preceded by "INFO stopcode BASE, Key=11" both times.  Key = 11 means
the slot crashed when the black box sensed a parity error from the KL's
memory.  Lucien has been informed.  I will be working on P035/E01 which
will make sure that buffered stopcode messages get printed when crashing.

Subject: DSKCLN running out of address space 

Joe,
  If... we had the monitor call to map user virtual memory to physical
memory (.prrw) then... DSKCLN could put it's bit maps in physical memory
[with careful handshake with the monitor]
[better yet, the monitor reserves physical memory (for DSKCLN) until
 the DSKCLR UUO]
...and then DSKCLN could handle *any* size disk structure!

You don't even really have to teach DSKCLN about mapping, just modify the
test/set bit routines to map physical memory like it does for the SATs.
[without mapping physical memory, vpeek/vpoke might work (slowly)].

Subject: Hotline Call XSYSF74 


Not HOTLINE.LOG FORMAT...

System: F74 FFF - could not find system structure

Ali had been called in after 9:30pm due to BADSAT/WRTSAT/etc. crashes and
after getting KL10 Halted a number of times trying to reboot the system
he decided to swap hardware from DDD to FFF.

F74 on FFF is now running full dskcln with no apparent problems (as of this
writing).


Ali beleives the problem is somewhere in the CPU...SA10 path since FFF is
not having any problems.  Anyway, since it it presumed to be HARDWARE, we
are off the case until further notice.

We were called prior to Ali's notification that F74 was running dskcln. I
was talking to Bonnie Terry when operations was notified of this information.

Subject: Re: Setting LICENSE of F33 

Um.. my fault actually, F33 is my test host for the new SETOP program and
I turned the switch to only write validated OPERnames to the password file.

My fault, because the database I was using was a 2-week old base that didn't
have any (read *ANY*) users validated properly with their ISC employee numbers
so, although everything was written correctly on D34, when I exited my test
copy on F33, it clobbered the real file with stale data.

You had an opername that had 0 license.  Since you said O... without asking
for explicit licenses, it said, oh.. you want, let me see.. nothing, OK! and
set nothing(!) so it didn't complain, 'cuz your password and all was alright.

The other problem is that it would fix itself when the password-file daemon
runs, but that happens to be every 150 minutes (read 2.5 hours).  I got a
call from operations and I fixed it!

FYI... the newest latest greatest version is this hour now running on D34.
       It is a little kinder about some things, and now enforced the TYMNET
       password standard of nothing trite, nothing short, nothing without
       an embedded non-alpha, etc...                  (up 2, "d" should be "s")

1. is 39 still up somewhere (i.e. 39's packs)?
2. any idea on problems with PEAK, still getting complaints.  Error code
   says file not found (SYS)PEAK from FRMRUN.  I think maybe an old version
   of FRMRUN library on 74 that causes problems?

GENTLEMEN,

    I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THE TYMCOM-X GROUP STILL DOES THE
PDP-10 BASE CODE GENERATION. THERE IS A PROJECT #47582 TO REMOVE A 9.6
HARDWIRE AND INSTALL A MEMORY SHUFFLER LINK FROM NODE 4261 TO EBUS
NODE 7004. THE PROJECT LISTS THE BOUND FILE IN THE TYM5 DIRECTORY IS TO
BE LOADED INTO 7004 BUT I NOTICED THE NW7004.BND FILE IS ONLY 63 PAGES
LONG AS COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL 69 PAGES FOR EBUS NODES. I WOULD APPRECIATE
YOUR RESPONSE ON THIS WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE. THE PROJECT IS TENTATIVELY
SCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15TH AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE SURE
THE CODE FOR 7004 IS GOING TO WORK TO BE SURE HOST 31 ISN'T DOWN ANY
LONGER THAN NECESSARY.

    SO TO SUMMARIZE, NODE 7004 NEEDS THE CODE TO LOOK FOR MS LINKS FROM
SWITCHERS ND4261 AND ND5405. THE HOST INTERFACE SLOT SHOULD NOT
NEED TO BE CHANGED BUT I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT TO DECIDE HOW

THE CODE SHOULD BE SET UP.

THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR COOPERATION

Yes, we support the EBUS base code.
I updated ND7004.TYM to have 2 SIO lines and 0 SYNC lines.
The new BND file is (TYM5)NW7004.BND on F33 and D54.

Subject: SYSDAT 

Carl,
  i tried syssho on 33, only to find that sysdat wasn't running.  I tried
starting it, but may not have done so correctly.  I also checked 25, and
it wasn't running there because (SRA)SYSDAT.SAV doesn't seem to exist...
  MSO came and took my 3/110, so i am back to 3/50.  before they came,
i got the Fujitsu sort of working:  the controller would say that it
was formating, but with a lot of errors.  later checks showed that the
headers of cylinder 0 were not (what i thought to be) correct, so some-
thing may not have been seeking correctly at all.  the drive deteriorated
yesterday to the point where diag kept saying that the drive wasn't ready,
although the drive ready lights were on.  then it wouldn't let me boot off
the SCSI drive, so i removed the xylogics controller, got the SCSI working,
re-installed the xylogics controller, and it still wouldn't work (couldn't
find the fujitsu drive).  I think we need to reassemble the xylogics con-
troller and put it in a server (Ron's new one may arrive next week) and see
if the controller is any good before playing further with the disk.

I can set status inside SPOOL.  (SYS)NONAME and (FTSYS)NONAME both recognize
when I type in a wrong password, but when I type in the right password, it
acts like it can't see the bit that must be set for a quota change.

I just now tried the following on X32:
  REN (SYS)DRWSPR.X=(SYS)DRWSPR.EPO
  REN (SYS)DRWSPR.EPO=(SYS)DRWSPR.14
  R SETOP
  LIST JMS
  REN (SYS)DRWSPR.14=(SYS)DRWSPR.EPO
  REN (SYS)DRWSPR.EPO=(SYS)DRWSPR.X
  R SETOP
  LIST JMS

It says I have the exact same license bits in both cases.  NONAME can find
my entry, but acts as if the required bit is not set.

We would ask you to check the data for TACKSCOMM (CID 17161; GAN 32513;    
UUN 311704) in March.    
     
When we have isuue the tymcomm accounting processing, we found the    
problem data for TACKSCOMM.   
The content is as follows;    
     
1. The data is for 00:12 , 22 of Mar 89' (PST) and 00:12, 29 of Mar 89' (PST)   
   ,and for service code 155 and 154.   
     
2. The quantity of service code 155 is too much as compared with the quantity   
   of service code 154 at same time.

3. As you know, we had the same problem before and we requested to check   
   the data for TACKSCOMM with my ontyme (#M17863 and #M19633).  
     
As we can give you the information of the spool request number in this time,    
please check the data and inform the investigation as soon as possible.    
We are looking forward to your prompt reply. 
If you have any question please contact me.

It crashed with a page fault in the middle of the page fault handler.
It could be a software problem - the information stored in the crash
dump is ambiguous.  Even if it is a hardware problem, I doubt very much
that an FE would find anything wrong.  Especially since the system has been
up for almost 24 hours.   /Joe

Calls to the PDP-10 Support Hotline:

27-Jun-89 17:30 /Carl
Contact:  was on-site at Fremont when problem occured.
Problem:  System 38 could not find the boot blocks or the home pages.
          Loaded system from tape; all disks were OK except for DSKB0.
          Attempted to re-create the home pages by copying a good set
          off of DSKB1.
Fix:      Problem was a read/write board in the disk drive.  Ran DSKCLN
          in check mode - no real errors.

25-Jun-89 03:15 /Joe (Sunday morning)
Contact:  Fremont Operations, (415)498-2588, Cindy, F74
Problem:  System 74 crashed after several RIB errors, BAD-SATs, other problems.
Diagnosis:Had them bring up the system in MANUAL mode so that I could
          run the ERRCHK program.  It reported that disk BPB4 had accumulated
          20 soft (recoverable) errors since 1-June.
Fix:      They ran the PAKCPY utility and copied the contents of that disk
          to another pack.  23 files were marked as being damaged and have
          been restored from backup tapes.

Subject: Call from Fayez Sarofim 

Monday morning I got a call from Marilyn Bear of Fayez Sarofim (713)654-4484.
The person who had been in charge of their KS-2020 left, and they needed to
have all passwords changed.  Marilyn had changed the OPER license password,
but needed help with the others.  The LVALID program changed the local password
after she logged in as user FS7; I had to telecopy the PASSWO program from
another PDP10 so she could change the TYMNET password for FS7.  Together,
we came up with a new SETE password, which I installed in SYSTEM.SAV and in
the running monitor.

They expected to shut down the KS-2020 on June first, but, as usual, it must
be kept running for another couple of months until the replacement system
is functioning.

Subject: Located cause of "frame capacity exceeced" on D23. 

At 2:25pm CDT, someone logged in as DBTTMS created 6 files in directory
NETDB on system D23.  This person entered these jobs into the SUBMIT queue, set
to go off every 15 minutes.  Because they were entered wrong, these requests
logged in 6 detached jobs every 15 minutes until all available frames were in
use.  At 8:30pm CDT, I received a hotline call from Dallas Operations. They
could not log in to run the billing and accounting programs.  

If these batch SUBMIT jobs had been entered properly, they would have used
the OPER password for MCOLVIN to log in as MCOLVIN, MHILL, and GBAWA on
hosts 7001 and 8458.  Since these hosts are Tymnet MUXes, the end result
would be to steal control away from the persons logged in there.

Today I talked with Mike Hill of Payment Systems Co in New Jersey, phone
(301)840-6106.  He said the he and his supervisor, Metron Colvin, knew
nothing about these SUBMIT jobs.  They had abruptly terminated an employee
on Wednesday, and that is probably the source of the unauthorized jobs.

TRW is having serious problems.  The LUD was missing from the system directory
and could not restore it from tape due to read errors on the tape and a UFD
error on the disk.  The DSKCLN program also reported a RIB error on HOME.SYS.
This was at 2:14pm.  I told them to do a system rebuild.  At 11:28pm, I
was paged by Tina Ngo, who said that the TITO program was reporting read
errors on about 1 of every 3 files.  The monthly saves for June and May
were just as bad.  The system hung during the restore, and now won't
boot the microcode from the tape drive.  It's 2:45am, the FE is being called.

System 33 in Fremont had a servo go out on one disk, now they are picking
up hard read errors.  About 60 bad spots were reported, all on head 29, in
the vicinity of cylinder 400.  They are trying to copy out the pack now,
if that fails, it my take 24 hours to do a rebuild.  This was at 2:35am
(at the same time I had TRW on the line).

path from TYMNET to BUBBNET?  Gateway host 1552 is very slow.  /Joe

Subject: Please zero out the prev pointer on PANGILINA in SETOP. 

PANGILINA is the first person under CHAVEZ, so the left pointer to OROURKE
is wrong.  If the real OROURKE is deleted, PANGILINA points to the empty
entry.  Then the next person to be defined (such as TEST) is screwed.
And we get an infinite loop when SETOP allows CHAVEZ to be transfered
to CHAVEZ.  It looks like you need to manually null out the bad pointer.

I recommend modifying SETOP to regenerate all back pointers as it is verifying
the map.		/Joe

Subject: Transfer of WALLING or RIVERS: CHAVEZ to CHAVEZ 

I don't understand how SETOP is allowig a transfer of an individual from
a specific manager back to that same manager... I think this situation is
the problem.  SETOP should NOT allow a stupid transfer form/to the same
manager.

In terms of the bad pointer, it seems that PANGILINA used to report to
SCAROTHERS or OROURKE used to report to CHAVEZ and when one of these was
transferred, the pointer was not fixed up.

I'd rather not "regenerate" the pointers, (writing on a mapped file) if it
is NOT necessary, maybe I can verify the back pointers and fix it only if
it is incorrect.  I will also check the transfer code.  Apparently, that
could be causing the back pointer slip.  sic PANGILINA/OROURKE.

Subject: DRWSPR.BIN format 

Joe,
  F.Y.I.  just in case you need to do anything in the future, and i am not
available, the numbers printed by trace are the word offsets into the file,
however 0 = 1000, since the first page has info and the usage map.

To zero the pointer for PANGILINA, (I knew the format was:
   word 0 :  man,,sub
   word 1 :  gni,,sib
   word 2 :  grt,,gft
where man=manager, sub=subordinate, gni="gnilbis" or back-sibling,
sib=sibling, grt=grants, gft=gifts)

However, OROURKE's id-pointer was 33240,  so it was simple to locate the
pointers that said 1000+33260[ 33240,,33300  and replace it with 0,,33300
without knowing the above format.

See previous message as for future fixes to SETOP... not sure when it will
be done, since %n (105) is what is running, current sources are for 107
with previous soruces available, but additional fixes not yet tested were
installed and I need to evaluate whether they ought to be added or not.
