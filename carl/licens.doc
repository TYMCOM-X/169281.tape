Introduction

			    License Introduction


    Some processes on the computer require special capabilities to perform
    their tasks properly.  Other processes require access to information and
    functionality.  License is the mechanism used to control the access each
    individual or program may obtain to these capabilities and information.

    License is set using the OPER program, which reads a secure system data
    structure and verifies access to any given license via password controls.

    Once license is set, the user may manipulate active license using the
    monitor commands ENABLE and DISABLE.  These commands allow a user to set
    license using OPER and enable or disable various licenses individually.

    The "SETE 0" monitor command is used to disable license completely until
    it is set again using the OPER program.

    License is administered by the systems staff and the validations groups
    within McDonnell Douglas ISC.  Please check with your management in order
    to determine whether you are required to perform tasks on the PDP-10s
    which require license.  License will ONLY be granted where it is needed.
    (Note:  If your managment doesn't have a good reason why you require a
    specific license, you probably don't really need it.)

    The SETOP program is used to administer licenses and OPER names which are
    authorized to use them.  The OPPS program is a mini-SETOP which allows a
    user or manager to change the password associated with their OPER names
    or their subordinates without having to bother with additional commands in
    the SETOP program.

    The validations group is currently responsible for the verification of
    employee status and the creation and deletion of OPER names.  Managers
    and individuals with the license-granting capability are responsible for
    administering license to each individual.  Thus, DO NOT ask validations
    to give you license.  The validations group ONLY gives you a valid OPER
    name.  Your manager, co-workers or system support staff administer the
    specific licenses granted to your OPER name.

    Managers and individual employees that have OPER names should be familiar
    with the PDP-10 commands and the programs used to administer license in
    order to better utilize and understand the responsibility that comes with
    having an OPER name.

Types of License

			    License Types


    There are three major classes of license:  Capabilities, pseudo-license
    and frame-license.  Capabilites determine what a user may or may not do
    while running SETOP and OPPS.  Pseudo-license is used by various system
    utility programs to determine what a user may or may not do while running
    each of the various utility programs.  Frame-license may be set, enabled
    or disabled on the users frame (or job) so that the operating system may
    determine what capabilities the user has while running various programs.
    Frame-license also controls what access a user has to user and system
    information on each host.

Initialization and rebuilding


    When SETOP is initialized (this will only occur once) or rebuilt, the
    database will be empty.  To allow the generation of a new database SETOP
    has a built-in mechanism for generating the ROOT of the tree.  Once this
    is done, the employee entries may be re-entered one at a time or by using
    the rebuild procedure.  (No one except the software support group should
    ever have need to do this.  See your system software support specialist
    for information on the rebuild procedure).

Record descriptions


    Employee Record

	The employee record is a description of an authorized individual that
	requires some particular privilege or capability that is unobtainable
	just by having a valid username on a particular host computer system.
	The information in this record is needed to track the person that
	is responsible for using a particular opername.  The direct line of
	corporate management may also found in this record.  (As such, it is
	possible for an employee record to exist, without any status, for the
	sole purpose of tracking an individual's manager).

	Employee Number			ISG Employee Number
	District Number			Marketing District number
	Entry Info			Date-time of entry, who entered
	Employee Name			Name of Employee
	Employee Phone			Phone number, interoffice mail stop
	Security Mail address *		SMTP mailing address
	User Name of employee **	Assigned network username(s)


     *  In the event of any suspected improprieties, SMTP mail will be
	directed to this address or to the address specified in the manager's
	record for this opername.  A message may also be sent to the address
	designated by those individuals that have granted various licenses to
	this employee.

    **  This username will be used to identify access via the appropriate
	network to the host systems designated herein.  In the event of
	any suspected security breach the owner of this username will be
	contacted as well as other appropriate security officials.

	The usernames that may use this opername as designated will be
	permitted to use this opername without question.  Any others will
	be flagged by the stream reader and mail will be sent to the
	appropriate parties.  Note:  Due to the lifetime of the PDP-10s
	this project will probably never be automated, however it will be
	able to be done by hand when a security breach is recognized.

	Note:  The opername belongs to the specified employee.  The main
	purpose of the username list is for those employees that use more
	than one username in the normal process of work.

Record descriptions


    Opername Record

	The Opername record describes completely the capabilities of each
	opername associated with an individual.  An employee may have any
	number of different opernames.

	Oper Name			12 character oper status name
	Password Cipher			Hashed password
	Password Change TDT		Date and time of password change
	Who changed password 1-12	Opername that changed the password
	Payroll Site # and ISG #	ISG Employee info
	Marketing district		Marketing information
	License				Implicit license for this name
	Grant,,Gift pointers		Link to list of grants and gifts
	Employee info pointer		External pointer to employee info
	Management chain pointers	Manager and subordinate pointers

	A linked list of capabilities is kept with pointers to the opername
	and the employee that granted and received the license.  This list
	allows different licenses to be granted by different opernames and
	merged into a single license list.


    License Grant Record

	Each license grant record describes the license that is to be passed
	from one opername to another.  Each record is linked to all other
	records for a particular opername and to all licenses granted by an
	opername.  Note:  The two lists thus linked have no bearing on the
	management structure or each other.  Thus, any opername with LG may
	pass any of it's license to any other opername (provided there are no
	loops detected by the SETOP program).

	For reasons of security, if any license is taken away from an
	opername, any license grants by that opername also lose license.
	To prevent problems when an employee leaves the company, the
	employee's record can be marked inactive rather than cancelled
	until all licenses passed by that opername to others can be passed
	by some other opername (probably one taking the place of the
	employee that is now gone).

	All license grant records contain activation and removal dates.
	If the activation date is 0, the entry date is used.  If the
	removal date is 0, no termination is assumed.

	Grantor pointer			Opername granting license
	Receiver pointer		Opername receiving license
	Grantor list link		Next grant by this grantor
	Receiver list link		Next grant for this receiver
	Activation Date			Start Date
	Removal Date			Stop  Date
	License value			License granted/received

    I   Exit                Exit program.
	Quit                Exit program.

    I   Trace     opername  Print trace information for an entry.
    D   Debug               Allow developer to debug the program.
    D   Build     <file>    Build the database from a flat file.
    D   Dump      <file>    Dump the database into a flat file.
    D   Open      <file>    Read system file or <file> into memory.
    D   Statistic opername  Show statistics for an opername entry.
    D   Verify              Verify structure and space allocation.


    The interpretation of the codes is as follows:

    P   Privileged command, requires setop-utility (SU or SM) license.
    G   Restricted command, requires license-grant (LG) license.
    M   Restricted command, requires manager (MG) license.
    *   Not restricted for self, requires MG license for subordinates.
    I   Invisible command, does not appear in help text.
    D   Debugging command, must be privileged and in maintenance mode.


    The difference between the SU and SM capabilities is that SU may
    act on the entire tree, while SM may only act on the branch that
    the opername manages.
