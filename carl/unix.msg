Subject: Re: Notes from UNIX class 

To all of you...

  I asked at the desk, and they do have copies of the notes/slides used
for the class.  I do not (yet) know what they want (cost) for additional
copies.

  However, if we assune, MDFSCO is purchasing them.. (or they are free? which
I sincerely doubt)... Who wants a copy, (how many do we want?)

  I will check with Craig at lunchtime (Wednesday) and get the copies
before the class is over... presumably, I will be able to quote the price
at that time.

/Carl
PS  Let Craig know if you want a copy... /Carl

Subject: TUMS features on Unix 

I have read TFM and still have problems with Unix mail.  Especially after
being used to TUMS, using real commands, aliases/macros, and decent help.
The private net and public net people migrating to Unix are going to have
the same problems.  Have you considered creating a TUMS front-end for mail
(like bc is a front-end for dc)?  This may be part of Carl's new job

Subject: Unix Question with access to Host 9929 

Carl,
	Now I have a question.  As exists now, we can use our username are 
able to access system 25 54 ect.  Any timetable or plan on how our usernames
will be validated on the host 9929 for Unix?  Our you going to change the
group access we have now?  (Class of 2 Group of 1 to host 25.)  In the
future will we have a new class and group to host 9929 or will the class
be changed to allow us to colon option to host 9929?  Thanks.



PS  What about the Ticket System on System 56?  Any word on that?

We are sending the following memo to you as managers in the license tree.
Please ensure that all users under your management comply.

The Validations Department is in the process of updating our current infor-
mation on employees who have status names.

We appreciate your cooperation, and we hope you understand that this is a
necessary step to improve the security of our Network. Basically, it will 
provide accountability, and will give us immediate access to the person that
owns the status name.

Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behaf another user.

Debbie,
  I sent a note about SETOP to a group a people that were on the
memo's sent back and forth between Ed and Wayne and used their return
address and apparently they had your name spelled wrong... so, please
get a copy of the message from Ed Roop, or let me know to re-send it

Subject: TUMS features on Unix 

I have read TFM and still have problems with Unix mail.  Especially after
being used to TUMS, using real commands, aliases/macros, and decent help.
The private net and public net people migrating to Unix are going to have
the same problems.  Have you considered creating a TUMS front-end for mail
(like bc is a front-end for dc)?  This may be part of Carl's new job

Subject: Unix Question with access to Host 9929 

Carl,
	Now I have a question.  As exists now, we can use our username are 
able to access system 25 54 ect.  Any timetable or plan on how our usernames
will be validated on the host 9929 for Unix?  Our you going to change the
group access we have now?  (Class of 2 Group of 1 to host 25.)  In the
future will we have a new class and group to host 9929 or will the class
be changed to allow us to colon option to host 9929?  Thanks.



PS  What about the Ticket System on System 56?  Any word on that?

Carl:

	On the Unix front, I logged on about 13:35 on the 8th.  I was
connected but was hung up.  When I tried to log back in, I got a clearing
cause of C:9 and a Diagnostic of 201 Link Failure.  The host then went
shut.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARL,
   I ATTENDED YOUR UNIX CLASS LAST TUESDAY AND AM PREPARING TO GIVE A CLASS
ON WHAT I LEARNED. I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS ON SOME THINGS I NEED CLEARED
UP.
 
1) PLEASE EXPLAIN THE SITUATION ON THE NIB AND BND FILES. I UNDERSTOOD THAT
   THE BND FILES WON'T BE RETAINED IN THE SYSTEM AT ALL, THAT WHEN WE NEED
   TO LOAD A NODE THAT WE'LL HAVE TO LOAD IT A SLOT AT A TIME. I ALSO
   UNDERSTOOD THAT THE NIB FILES WILL BE RETAINED BUT ONLY IN THE BACKUP
   DIRECTORY. PLEASE PLEASE ADVISE IF I AM NOT CORRECT.
 
2) I CAN'T SEEM TO LOG ONTO GEMINI (9929) OR ANY OF THE OTHER SERVERS. HAVE
   YOU HAD AN OPPERTUNITY TO VALIDATE ANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE
   CLASS. IF SO, PLEASE ADVISE ME OF THE LOGON PROCEDURE.
 
3) I'M ABLE TO ACCESS THE REPETE SYSTEM BUT AM UNABLE TO COPY TYM AND CMD
   FILES FROM THE PDP10 (SYSTEM 25). ARE THERE ANY OF THESE FILES OUT ON
   REPETE SO I CAN PLAY WITH VI, JOVE, NAD, ETC?? IF SO WHERE ARE THEY?
 
 
ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN GIVE WOULD BE HELPFULL, I NEED TO GIVE MY CLASS ON
THURSDAY, 6/15 AND THEN ANOTHER ON MONDAY, 6/19 SO YOUR PROMPT RESPONSE
IS REQUESTED. THANKS IN ADVANCE....
 
YOU CAN REACH ME AT NSCMS.D/HOLDERNESS OR 703/556/3233
 
 
                                                REGARDS,

              The transition from the PDP to the UNIX will
              remove all slot nib files.  We have two slot files
              that do not have either the command file or the tym
              file, only the nib.  These slots support the
              Lemcom.  It is my understanding that if we ever
              lose the nib files, we will have a difficult
              (impossible?) task to recreate the nib file.
 
              These slot files are currently located in
              (TYM5)ND6114.N01 and ND6134.N02.
 
              Please get back to me with your plan on keeping
              these nib files intact and safe.

After a shaky start on Monday, we were quite successful with 
the limited number of Nodes we have loaded.
 
Monday uncovered a few procedural discrepancies which 
delayed loading Network Nodes from UNIX  (Monday's projects
were completed from the PDP 10's).  These procedural issues
have been resolved and Code Loads were successful on
Tuesday.
 
This is a major milestone for the UNIX project.  There are
now 5 Nodes running in the public Net which were genned
and loaded from the Fremont Sun Systems.
 
There is a problem, however, with the Field involvement
in these projects.  That is, there has been very little.
As of Tuesday afternoon, only one project Node has had
a slot genned by the Field.
 
More involvement is necessary.  Every slot in every 
selected project Node should be genned in UNIX and passed
to PA for loading.  This week is your test period, as well
as ours.  We all need to work these systems as much as we
can.  Please generate these slots (even if there is no
change) on the UNIX systems.
 
Any questions or problems can be directed to Phillipe
Michel X7359.

Subject: unix scripts: newuser & newgroup 


Cynthia,

  I fixed the problems with newuser and with the negative uid's for
the order-processing people.  I changed their id's to the 5200 range
just after pi, and their group name from orderproc to op.

All of their directories need to be validated, and this can be done
using newuser.  However, you need to use newgroup first to setup the
group directory for group op.

please login to the unix system and type out:

   man newgroup

and

   man newuser

and then try them out.... also, it no longer matters what host
you are on.  That is why you have to specify the host name to
the newgroup script...

then newuser doesn't need to know that information... just the
name of the group so it can set gid.

leave me voice mail, or unix mail to user carl if you have any more
problems.   I'll be at the fremont data center after 11am, and
asleep till then - note time of this message -

talk to you today.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------




THE BETATEST UNIX WEEK HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL ONE AND WE ARE NOW READY
TO GO FULL SPEED ON THE MIGRATION OF THE PUBLIC NETWORK. THIS
ONTYME WILL EXPLAIN OUR MIGRATION PLAN, SCHEDULE, PROCEDURES AND
HOPEFULLY ALLEVIATE ANY CONFUSION.

PROCEDURES
-----------

WE WILL START GENNING THE 2000 SERIES OF NODES THE WEEK OF 7/10
AND LOAD THEM THE WEEK OF 7/17. IN ADDITION, ALL PROJECTS BEING
LOADED STARTING THE WEEK OF 7/17 WILL BE GENNED ON THE SUNS STARTING
THE WEEK OF 7/10. ALL BACKUP REQUESTS WILL BE DONE ON THE SUNS STARTING
7/10-THIS MEANS THE CS' HAVE TO GENERATE THEIR SLOT CODE ON THE SUNS
STARTING 7/10.

PI  GROUP WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PUBLIC NETWORK NODE CODE, AND THE
FIELD WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL GENERATION OF SLOT CODE ON THOSE NODES.
THE FIELD SHOULD USE THE 'NODE GET/NODE PUT' PROCEDURE ON TECHTIP DIRECTORY.
THE SLOT NIB FILES SHOULD BE GENNED ON THE CS' PERSONAL DIRECTORY AND
THEN ALL SLOT FILES SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE NETLOAD DIRECTORY(SATURN)
AT LEAST (2) WORKING DAYS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED LOAD DATE. IF AT THAT TIME,
THE SLOT CODE IS STILL NOT ASSEMBLED, AN ONTYME WILL BE SENT TO THE CS;
THE PROBLEM WILL BE ESCALATED UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS RESOLVED.

IN SUMMARY, THE CS' WILL GENERATE SLOT CODE IN THEIR HOME DIRECTORY,
PUT IT IN NETLOAD UNDER THE NODE'S DIRECTORY, AND PI WILL TAKE IT FROM
THERE AND PUT IT IN PILOAD. PI WILL GENERATE THE NODE CODE IN THEIR
HOME DIRECTORY, PUT IT IN PILOAD AND AFTER A SUCCESSFUL LOAD, PUT IT
IN TYM(PRODUCTION) DIRECTORY.

BACKUPS WILL NO LONGER BE DONE VIA ONTYME-CARL BALTRUNAS WILL SEND A
SEPARATE ONTYME EXPLAINING THE NEW PROCEDURES. WE WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT
BACKUPS FROM THE PDP-10'S SENT ON OR AFTER 7/10. THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS
IF THE CODE IS KNOWN TO BE NON-COMPATIBLE WITH UNIX IN WHICH CASE THE
CS SHOULD SPECIFY ON THE BACKUP REQUEST THAT THE CODE IS NON-COMPATIBLE.
ALSO, ALL BACKUP REQUESTS ON THE SUNS SHOULD CONTAIN THE T0#,C0#, AND N0#.

SCHEDULE
--------

7/7     DALLAS OPERATIONS MAKES TAPE OF ALL SYSTEM 54/25 FILES AT 15:00 CDT
        AND MOVES THEM TO THE SUNS IN FREMONT OVER THE WEEKEND.

7/10    ALL NEW PROJECTS FOR THE WEEK OF 7/17 IS GENNED ON THE SUNS-
        CS' GEN ALL SLOT CODE INVOLVED WITH THE NODES BEING LOADED.
        
        2000 SERIES NODES ARE GENNED ON SUNS(SEE BELOW)

        ALL BACKUP REQUESTS ARE DONE FROM THE SUNS

7/17    ALL CODE GENNED THE WEEK OF 7/10 GETS LOADED THE WEEK OF 7/17

        3000 SERIES NODES ARE GENNED ON SUNS-LOAD THE WEEK OF 7/24

7/24    4000 SERIES NODES GETS GENNED-LOAD THE WEEK OF 7/31

        ETC. UNTIL ALL SERIES OF NODES GET GENNED AND LOADED

SPECIFIC SCHEDULE- WE BROKE DOWN THE SERIES OF NODES INTO (5) EQUAL
                   SEGMENTS(MONDAY-FRIDAY) TO BE GENNED-THE LOAD WILL
                   TAKE PLACE EXACTLY (1) WEEK AFTER THE GEN. THE 2000
                   SERIES WILL BE THE SAME AS THE OTHER SERIES(2000-2147
                   ON 7/10 AND 3000-3147 ON 7/17,ETC.)

        PLANNED GENS/LOADS

        7/10- 2000-2147 LOAD ON 7/17
        7/11- 2150-2317 LOAD ON 7/18
        7/12- 2320-2467 LOAD ON 7/19
        7/13- 2470-2637 LOAD ON 7/20
        7/14- 2640-2777 LOAD ON 7/21

        7/17- 3000-3147 LOAD ON 7/24
        7/18- 3150-3317 LOAD ON 7/25
        7/19- 3320-3467 LOAD ON 7/26
        7/20- 3470-3637 LOAD ON 7/27
        7/21- 3640-3777 LOAD ON 7/28

        AND SO ON WITH OTHER SERIES....

WHILE THESE SERIES ARE BEING GENNED, NODES RELATING TO PROJECTS WILL ALSO
BE GENNED. THE PI COORDINATOR WILL SEND AN ONTYME/ALLMAIL TO **ALLCCS
TO NOTIFY THE FIELD WHAT ISIS NODES ARE INVOLVED WITH THE PROJECTS. IT IS
IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT BOTH SERIES/NODES AND PROJECTS/NODES REQUIRE SLOT
CODE GENERATED BY THE CS AT LEAST (2) FULL WORKING DAYS BEFORE THE LOAD
DATE. SLOTS NORMALLY GENERATED BY PI WILL STILL BE DONE BY THAT GROUP.

AS A BENEFIT, CARL HAS WRITTEN INFO ON UNIX AND OTHER MISC. FACTS
UNDER THE DIRECTORY TECHTIPS-HE WILL ALSO WRITE NEW PROCEDURES/INFO
AS THEY COME ALONG THIS MIGRATION.

NATURALLY, YOU CAN REACH US DIRECTLY BY SENDING MAIL IN UNIX(MAIL USERNAME),

SUBJECT: UNIX CONVERSION SCHEDULE

PHILIPPE,

I'VE TRIED TO CALL YOU TODAY, HOWEVER, I WASN'T GETTING YOUR
VOICE MAIL....SO I THOUGHT I'D SEND YOU AN ONTYME.

MY QUESTION REFERS TO THE UNIX SCHEDULE YOU SENT OUT FOR
CONVERSION TO UNIX OF THE 2000, 3000 SERIES NODE NUMBERS.

YOU HAVE STATED THAT THE 2000-2777 NODES WILL BE LOADED THE
WEEK OF 7/17, AND THE 3000-3777 NODES WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK
OF 7/24.

AFTER THAT THERE IS SOME CONFUSION.  BY SAYING "AND SO ON WITH
OTHER SERIES...." DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE 4000-4777 NODES
WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 7/31, AND 5000-5777 WILL BE LOADED
THE WEEK OF 8/7 AND 6000-6777 WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 8/14,
AND 7000-7777 WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 8/21, 10000-1?????
WILL BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 8/28.

JACK SNAVELY SENT OUT A SCHEDULE DATED JUNE 12, INDICATING THAT
THE  SERIES OF 4000-5777 WOULD BE LOADED THE WEEK OF 7/31 AND
THAT ALL REMAINING NODES WOULD BE LOADED THE WEEKS OF 8/7 AND 8/14.
ARE WE GOING TO BEGIN COMBINING NODES SERIES AS THE WEEKS GO ON OR
ARE WE TO FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE OF (1) SERIES OF NODES PER WEEK?


COULD YOU PLEASE BE MORE DETAILED IN THE SCHEDULE BEYOND THE
3000-3777 SERIES.   WE WOULD LIKE SPECIFICS FOR EACH WEEK
INDICATING EXACTLY WHICH NODES ARE SCHEDULED FOR WHICH WEEKS.

THANKS FOR YOUR COOPERATION

     Date:     11 July 1989
 
 
     Subject:  Unix Migration Project Meeting Minutes
 
 
     Next Meeting: TBD 
 
 
     Attendence:    J.Snavely      - Network Services
                    D.Murtaugh     - Network Operations
                    H.Matthews     - Program Manager 
                    G.Walker       - Software Tech Support
                    S.Spinale      - ACS and PSC representative
                    P.Whitehurst   - NTD Unix system support
                    P.Michel       - Project implementation 
                    J.Alcantara    - Unix system administration
                    C.Baltrunas    - Unix system support
                    P.Keifer       - Tymnet domestic field rep.

                    T.Kelley       - Network Resources
 
 
     A.  J.Snavely  introduced H.Matthews as  Manager,  Technical  Services 

taking  over  day  to day management of  the  migration  project  reporting 
directly to J.Snavely.
 
 
     B. Problem Escalations
 
1. 3270 SNA, PBH and ACOM sysgen failures reported, "operand error -  range 

out  of bounds". Possible cause - corruption of source code during  PDP  to 
Unix file transfer although this is unconfirmed.  Source code checksums  on 

PDP  and Unix did not match. Source re-copied, code regenned  and  problems 
solved. 
 
 
     Action:   B.Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program that 

compares the PDP and Unix directories after the PDP directory is 
copied  to  UNIX  to  prevent future  problems  of  this  nature. 

Complete date of 12 July is committed by P.Whitehurst.
 
Since all source codes were re-copied, it was recommended that all  patches 

be recopied as well.
 
     Action:  C.Baltrunas  to recopy upon notification from  G.Walker  that 

patch  directories  are  up  to  date.  

2.  Bits  vs.  LOADII  load  time  comparisons.  J.Snavely  reported  field 

complaints  and produced definative evidence that Fremont BITS  takes  much 
longer  than LOADII to load either slots or whole nodes. At this  time  the 

cause of the problem is unknown and several actions are underway to  gather 

more data to isolate the fault.
 
     Action:  It  so  happens that Unix system operators  around  the  S.J. 

campus are meeting on 11 July to discuss optimal X.25 parameters for Sun  - 
Tymnet  interface. G.Walker offered Tymnet X.25 expertise  to  participate, 

which  was  accepted.  If  neccessary, this group will  call  in  Sun  X.25 
support.
 
     Action:  J.Alcantara to re-test Bits load time from NCC  Unix  systems 

using  same  load  strings  as J.Snavely tests  and  compare  results  with 
J.Snavely tests.
 
     Action: H.Matthews to gather results on 13 July and obtain  assistance 

to  analyze results and determine if this has helped us isolate  slow  load 
times. If not, other actions will be taken until problem pinpointed.
 
3. Field Escalations
 
All  problems  related  to  the migration should  be  sent  to  the  OnTyme 

distribution   file  named  ***  SUN.HOTLINE.  The  recipients   shall   be 
C.Baltrunas, P.Michel and H.Matthews with copies to P.Keifer, G.Walker, and 

J.Snavely.
 
NTD, Operations and STS are staffed to handle Tymnet product failures.
 
     Action: Distribution files to be ready by 13 July.
 
4. NAD cannot build circuits
 
After  a  recent, new NAD release to the Suns it is reported  that  NAD  no 

longer builds circuits.
 
     Action:  P.Whitehurst  advised C.Baltrunas to check TYMLIB  setup  and 

contact her should he require more assistance.
 
 
 
     C. Sun System Status
 
1.  All  personal  directories submitted by P.Keifer  were  in  process  of 

transfer to Suns but a System 33 crash prevented completion, tranfers  will 
resume when 33 is stable.
 
     Action:  C.Baltrunas to insure IPC completes the work on the  11  July 

subject to system 33 stability.
 
2. C.Baltrunas provided update on present Fremont systems. 
 
3. P.Keifer commented on difficulties getting Unix validations.
 
     Action: P.Keifer to take the matter up with Validations directly.
 
4. Production cutover proceding per last published schedule. No changes  to 

report.


5. P.Michel stressed PI's need for multiple node gen scripts and  effective 

PI  code back up request procedures to meet the present 100 nodes per  week 
schedule.
 
     Action:  C.Baltrunas to delegate multiple node gen scripts to  J.Smith 

for completion no later than 13 July.
 
     Action:  C.Baltrunas to meet with D.Sakai to put backup procedures  in 

place and insure all field support organizations are notified. Due date  is 
13 July.
 
     FYI: D.Sakai will focus as backup request coordinator.
 
6.  It  became  clear that P.Keifer does not represent  all  field  support 

organizations.   For   example,  PSC  and  ACS.  S.Spinale   is   the   PSC 
representative and agreed to find out whom in ACS can act as a focal point. 
 
     Action:  H.Matthews  to contact S.Spinale in a few days to  learn  ACS 

rep.
 
7. Field Service Company requested ENGDIAGS be transferred to Suns.
 
     Action:  H.Matthews contacted P.Diamond to learn location of  all  FSC 

requirements. Awaiting return call from him.
 
8.  Malvern PA backup systems installation delayed.  Hardware  installation 

date is 13 July then target date to bring the systems to operational status 
is 28 July.
 
It is required that Malvern Unix systems have the same look and feel as the 

Fremont systems. 
 
     Action: C.Baltrunas to cut a backup image of a Fremont system and send 

it to Malvern.
 
     Action: H.Matthews to check milestones on project to interface Malvern 

Suns to Tymnet with D.Sakai.
 
9. Code release process requires further discussion and definition.
 
     Action:  H.Matthews  to interview various interest groups  to  develop 

requirements definition.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



I am having gen problems on the following nodes:

2177 - solo consat
I am not able to gen the solo consat node 2177 at this time because
the cmd file references files that were not copied over to UNIX.
Philippe is having Carl fix this.

2036 - slot 1 - SNA version 3.03
There are 2 problems with this slot.  The source patch file gets an
error of "line: 10 (1) error: Invalid opcode" for the 11th patch.
The checksums on system 25 and unix do not match (source)sna03.p03.
Pam Whitehurst will fix this.
The second problem is that a patch (snapat)posact.tst was not in system
33 and so was never copied over to unix.  I have left voice mail for
Gary Walker about this.


2063 - slot 1 - same as for slot 1 of node 2036.

2377 - slots 2 & 3 - The new version of CMT 7.04 is more efficient and so
does not display the status line as often.  Minnesota Mutual's script file
triggers when the status line message "SNA  APPL" is the last thing
displayed on the first screen.  I have opened escalation 250767 for this.
Richard Ho is investigating.

              FR: ROCK ANDERSON
 
 
              RE:  UNIX GEN PROBLEMS
 
 
              The unix will not gen slot 2 of node 2060.  The
              error message is indicating a bad
              (source)bbxs06.r01 file.  Phil Sneddon told me he
              was aware of the bad source file but thought it had
              been corrected.
 
              It is late in the day Thursday and this node is to
              be loaded Monday evening 7-17.  I will be on
              vacation Friday 7-14.
 
              I have asked Linda (Kaiser) Timme (out of the
              goodness of her heart) to try to gen the code
              Friday and to back it up.  Nobody else in my
              department is trained on the unix method at this
              time.  Linda knows of Phil's involvement, Phil
              knows of Linda's involvement and Phillipe Michelle
              also knows about the problem.
 
 
              ===============
 
              Another issue needs to be addressed.  We have two
              Lemcom machines, Nodes 6114 and 6134.  There are no
              tym or command files for the Lemcoms, only nib
              files.  Joan Kelly and I talked to a Tymnet person
              in Dallas who has four Lemcoms.  He doesn't have
              tym or command files either.  Ed Barens (Dallas)
              was saying that the code was created by NSC (NTD).
 
              The problem is that we must regen the nib file on
              the unix, but I am unable to do so without the tym
              and command files.
 
              EDI has all their traffic going through these
              Lemcoms.  What solution do you propose?
 
 
              I can be reached at 314-233-8570 or via Ontyme at
              ACS.R/ANDERSON.

re: *** Distribution File

An action item from Tuesday's project review meeting was to create a 
distribution file for field escalations during the Unix migration
project. This file is complete and available for use now. It is called
*** SUNESCAL and is available to all Ontyme users in the U.S. and MDISI.

Please forward this information to all your people.

Thanks,

a file has been created in one of my subdirectories called "core".
this file is 2,212,666 characters.  i do not believe i created this
file...maybe inadvertently?  due to the size of this file, i feel
compelled to delete it, but would appreciate some confirmation
as to how it came to be and if i should or should not delete it.

see: gemini/cts/lreynolds/02300/core

thank you,

you may have already thought of this, but....

would it be a good idea to rename ALL NDxxxx.xxx code in the pdp-10's from
ND to UN when the conversion has been completed.  this would hopefully
eliminate any confusion as to whether a node has been converted and
also help avoid having slot code inadvertently or unknowingly copied
over for revisions.

The following slots should not be loaded from the Sun systems next week,
unless the problems mentioned are fixed before the scheduled load day:



node 2060 - slot 2 - This will not gen because of a problem genning BBXS
            (this is Rock Anderson's account)

node 2177 - solo consat - files referenced in the CMD file have not been
            copied over to the Suns.

node 2036 - slot 1 - problems with the source patch file (checksums are
            different from those on the PDP10's)
            
node 2063 - slot 1 - problems with the source patch file (same as above)

node 2377 - slots 2 & 3 - recently revised version of 7.04 causes problems
            for customer.  ticket 250767 is open for this.

SUBJECT:  STATE OF THE UNIX PROJECT

THIS WEEK HAS BEEN A MAJOR MILESTONE FOR THE UNIX CONVERSION.  I AM NOT GOING
TO BELITTLE THE ISSUES WE FACE BUT I KNOW WITH YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT WE WILL
ACHIEVE OUR CONVERSION GOALS ON TIME.  IT HAS TAKEN THE COOPERATION OF BOTH
HEADQUARTERS AND FIELD PERSONNEL TO REACH THIS MILESTONE AND UNCOVER THE
REMAINING OBSTACLES TO THIS PROJECT.  I HAVE RECEIVED COMMITMENTS FROM 
NTD, TECH SUPPORT AND OPERATIONS TO DEDICATE WHATEVER RESOURCE IS NEEDED TO    
CORRECT THE REMAINING PROBLEMS AND MAINTAIN OUR TIME SCHEDULE.  I AM ASKING
FOR A COMMITMENT FROM ALL OF YOU AS WELL.

BY THIS TIME, YOU ALL SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE CHANGES TO THE CONVERSION 
SCHEDULE REGARDING NODE RANGES AND PROJECTS.  WE ARE LIMITING THE NODES
BEING CONVERTED TO UNIX FOR PRODUCTION CODE TO A SINGLE RANGE OF NODES PER
WEEK AS FOLLOWS:

    NODES 2000-2777 - WEEK OF 7/17
    NODES 3000-3777 - WEEK OF 7/24
    NODES 4000-4777 - WEEK OF 7/31
    NODES 5000-5777 - WEEK OF 8/7

PROJECTS WILL NOT BE CONVERTED UNLESS THE NODE NUMBER FALLS IN THE RANGE TO
BE CONVERTED THAT WEEK.

ONCE A NODE HAS BEEN CONVERTED, THE CODE ON THE PDP 10 WILL BE MOVED TO A 
HOLDING DIRECTORY CONTROLLED BY NETWORK CONTROL.  IF YOU NEED TO ACCESS
THOSE OLD FILES FOR ANY REASON, YOU MUST CONTACT NETWORK CONTROL.  THIS
HAS BEEN DONE TO INSURE OBSOLETE CODE IS NOT LOADED INTO THE NETWORK.

IN ADDITION, A FILE IS BEING CREATED ON THE UNIX SYSTEM TO TEACH THE
LOCATION AND PRODUCTION CODE FOR EVERY NODE IN THE NETWORK.  THIS FILE
WILL BE UPDATED, REAL TIME, BY NETWORK CONTROL AS CODE IS LOADED AND STABLE.

THE MAJOR REMAINING ISSUES ARE:

  - BUILDING CIRCUITS FROM NAD - THIS IS NEEDED FOR TROUBLESHOOTING
    IN THE FIELD.  PAM WHITEHURST IS WORKING THIS ISSUE.

  - BITS LOADING TIME EXCESSIVE - MAJOR IMPACT IF A SITE GOES DOWN
    AND NEEDS RELOADING.  PAM WHITEHURST IS HEADING A TEAM TO RESOLVE.

  - BACK-UP SYSTEMS IN MALVERN - SYSTEMS ARE HARDWARE INSTALLED AND
    EXPECTED TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL BY THURSDAY (7/20).  CARL BALTRUNAS
    
  - CONTENTS OF FIELD PERSONAL DIRECTORIES - THESE HAVE BEEN MOVED BUT
    NOT YET DISTRIBUTED.  THIS WILL BE COMPLETED TODAY (7/14).  CARL
    BALTRUNAS

  - PVC CODE MISSING FILES - FILES ARE MOVED BUT NOT YET DISTRIBUTED.
    THIS WILL BE COMPLETED TODAY (7/14).  CARL BALTRUNAS

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BACK-UP SYSTEMS (TARGETED FOR 7/20) THE LIST SHOULD
BE CLEAR BY MONDAY.  AS IN THE PAST, ANY PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED SHOULD BE
ESALATED TO PHIL KIEFER FOR FIELD PERSONNEL OR HARRY MATHEWS FOR HQ AND PSC.

ONCE AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION TO DATE AND ASK
THAT WE JOIN TOGETHER WITH RENEWED ENERGY FOR THE NEXT FEW EEEKS TO MAKE THIS
PROJECT SUCCESSFUL.

              I sent you an Ontyme Thursday, 7-13 concerning a
              BBXS slot I was unable to gen.  That was Node 2060,
              slot 2, version BBXS06.C01.  As of this morning, I
              am still unable to gen the slot.  This node is
              scheduled to be loaded tonight.  Please do not load
              this node.
 
              Node 2430 is scheduled to be loaded Wednesday,
              7-19.  I am unable to gen slots 1, 2, and 3.  Slots
              1 and 2 are BBXS code and I am getting the same
              error as Node 2060, slot 2.  Slot 3 is HSA version
              IHSA01.C06.  This version does not appear to be in
              the Source directory.
 
              I come in through the Titan Server and my ID is
              randerso.  I can be reached at 314-233-8570.

SUBJECT>   Today's new release by NTD of NAD and BITS


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Today, NTD has released new versions of NAD and BITS for the Public Net Suns
that is reported to fix several outstanding faults. Since these faults, among
other issues, has halted implementation of the Unix migration I request
an immediate release of this software to Fremont so I can begin testing.

Although I ask for an immediate release I do not wish to by-pass the QA
function. I ask for the immediate release 1. because of the reason I gave above
and 2. because it is my understanding that the QA Unix systems
are running 3.5 SUNOS whereas the Public Net systems are running 4.0.
I am concerned that QA is not able to test this release under the same 
operating enviroment as the Public Net. In fact, one of the fixes
now released solves a problem only evident under 4.0, not 3.5.

Please reply to let me know if you can test NAD and Bits on some other Sun
in Bubbnet running SUNOS 4.0, if this can be tested before next Wednesday and
when the QA Suns willl be upgraded for SUNOS 4.0.

              RE:  UNIX GEN PROBLEMS
 
 
              The unix will not gen slot 2 of node 2060.  The
              error message is indicating a bad
              (source)bbxs06.r01 file.  Phil Sneddon told me he
              was aware of the bad source file but thought it had
              been corrected.
 
              It is late in the day Thursday and this node is to
              be loaded Monday evening 7-17.  I will be on
              vacation Friday 7-14.
 
              I have asked Linda (Kaiser) Timme (out of the
              goodness of her heart) to try to gen the code
              Friday and to back it up.  Nobody else in my
              department is trained on the unix method at this
              time.  Linda knows of Phil's involvement, Phil
              knows of Linda's involvement and Phillipe Michelle
              also knows about the problem.
 
 
              ===============
 
              Another issue needs to be addressed.  We have two
              Lemcom machines, Nodes 6114 and 6134.  There are no
              tym or command files for the Lemcoms, only nib
              files.  Joan Kelly and I talked to a Tymnet person
              in Dallas who has four Lemcoms.  He doesn't have
              tym or command files either.  Ed Barens (Dallas)
              was saying that the code was created by NSC (NTD).
 
              The problem is that we must regen the nib file on
              the unix, but I am unable to do so without the tym
              and command files.
 
              EDI has all their traffic going through these
              Lemcoms.  What solution do you propose?
 
 
              I can be reached at 314-233-8570 or via Ontyme at
              ACS.R/ANDERSON.

              RE: UNIX GEN PROBLEMS II
 
 
              I sent you an Ontyme Thursday, 7-13 concerning a
              BBXS slot I was unable to gen.  That was Node 2060,
              slot 2, version BBXS06.C01.  As of this morning, I
              am still unable to gen the slot.  This node is
              scheduled to be loaded tonight.  Please do not load
              this node.
 
              Node 2430 is scheduled to be loaded Wednesday,
              7-19.  I am unable to gen slots 1, 2, and 3.  Slots
              1 and 2 are BBXS code and I am getting the same
              error as Node 2060, slot 2.  Slot 3 is HSA version
              IHSA01.C06.  This version does not appear to be in
              the Source directory.
 
              I come in through the Titan Server and my ID is
              randerso.  I can be reached at 314-233-8570.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after PDP
                to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned that
                UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled twice,
                whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked to 
                assemble patches twice an operand out of range error is
                reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

            1.A.3  Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations 
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

            B.  Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.

                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

            1.B.3  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match settings
                                 recommendations of informed UNIX system 
                                 operators around the San Jose campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a 
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

            1.B.4  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for 
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that 
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

            C.  Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for 
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

    II.     ***  Distribution file named SUNESCAL is ready on MDISC
            Internal Ontyme systems for Field questions or escalations
            pertaining to SUN/UNIX migration matters.

    III.    Personnel Directory copies between PDP and UNIX is complete.
            Further file transfers are the responsibility of the
            individual using the Net Copy program.

            3.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

    IV.     Patch directory copy to UNIX is complete.  Further file
            transfers are the responsibility of STS.

            4.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

    V.      P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            5.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 7/14/89.  No feedback since.
                                 Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to think
                                 about allowing background jobs to run
                                 slower then they presently run.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to recontact J. Smith to learn
                                 of this progress on the program.

            5.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas has made progress in program
                                 specification and further progress is
                                 pending successful installation of
                                 Malvern back up system, so that when back
                                 ups are completed on Fremont SUN, the
                                 backup program automatically updates TYM
                                 and CMD files to Malvern SUN.

            5.1.C  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to develop program that
                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated
                                 completion is 28 July 1989.

            5.1.D  Action: 7/14  Due to the anticipated volume of 
                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

                                 C. Baltrunas to implement program
                                 controlled method in conjunction with
                                 point 5.1.C.

                   Update: 7/24  See update point 5.1.C.

    VI.     It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            6.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

            6.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            6.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            6.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            6.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.
                                 Matthews.

                                 R. Ferguson also reports that T. Kochman
                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUNs.

    VII.    Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 7/24  Network connections to Malvern SUN's
                                 installed and operational three days
                                 ahead of agreed to schedule after it was 
                                 discovered that a new dual Mini Engine
                                 was needed.  Great work Lisa Baker and Ed
                                 Kalinowski, thanks!

                                 C. Baltrunas working with T. Kane of NSSC
                                 to bring the SUN's to a fully
                                 operational, ready to use state by
                                 Friday, 28 July 1989.

    VIII.   T201 Software gen problems were reported by P. Kiefer on July
            11, 1989.

                   Update:  No further reports from Field.  Item closed.

    IX.     Exceptions to node range 2000-2777 for UNIX conversions was
            discussed as being nodes with PASCAL Software, Lemcoms, disks
            or tapes and nodes outside the continental U.S.A.  These nodes
            will be migrated after standard Tymnet nodes are done.

                   Action: 7/14  NETQA to provide list of all PASCAL
                                 nodes, nodes with disks or tapes and
                                 Lemcoms.

                   Update: 7/25  Complete.  Information forwarded to P.
                                 Michel.  Item closed.

    X.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, thru one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETUAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    XI.     D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen
            procedures to Netcon.

                   Action: P. Michel to provide informal hands-on training
                           and document the code gen procedure prior to
                           his departure for Paris.

    XII.    Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 

            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

    XIII.   SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

    XIV.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

    XV.     UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

    XVI.    Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - code distribution via unit
            systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

    XVIII.  Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

    XIX.    It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC0) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As of today new versions of BITS and NAD resides on the Public Net Sun
systems which reportedly fix several faults. In order to test
these programs prior to restarting the Unix migration I request your help.

I require that you instruct your people to gen and load as many lab nodes and
test slots as possible on Monday and Tuesday using the newly released programs.
The objective of this test will be to restart field involvement in the program
to generate and load on those two days as many products as possible.
Please report any faults to *** SUNESCAL.

A second phase of the field involvement in the pre-production test is to
submit slot code for the following node numbers by Wednesday:

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after PDP
                to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned that
                UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled twice,
                whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked to 
                assemble patches twice an operand out of range error is
                reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

            1.A.3  Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.  Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.

                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

            1.B.4  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.8.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

            C.  Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

            D.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

    II.     Personnel Directory copies between PDP and UNIX is complete.
            Further file transfers are the responsibility of the
            individual using the Net Copy program.

            2.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

                   Update: 7/28  NETQC was not present at the meeting, but
                                 since there is another escalation it is
                                 considered complete.

    III.    Patch directory copy to UNIX is complete.  Further file
            transfers are the responsibility of STS.

            3.1    Action: 7/24  NETQC (Earl) to verify proper ownership
                                 of files.

                   Update: 7/28  Misreported, no problem.  Item dropped
                                 from minutes.

    IV.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            4.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to recontact J. Smith to learn
                                 of this progress on the program.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.

            4.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas presently working on
                                 program, will be ready by 1 August.

 

            4.1.C  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to develop program that
                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated
                                 completion is 28 July 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Program to be ready 1 August.

            4.1.D  Action: 7/14  Due to the anticipated volume of 
                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

                                 C. Baltrunas to implement program
                                 controlled method in conjunction with
                                 point 5.1.C.

                   Update: 7/24  See update point 7/28 4.1.C.
   
    V.      It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            5.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - AES - now participating.

            5.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            5.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            5.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            5.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon

                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.
                                 Matthews.

                                 R. Ferguson also reports that T. Kochman
                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.

    VI.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 7/24  Network connections to Malvern SUN's
                                 installed and operational three days
                                 ahead of agreed to schedule after it was
                                 discovered that a new dual Mini Engine
                                 was needed.  Great work Lisa Baker and Ed
                                 Kalinowski, thanks!

                   Update: 7/28  One Malvern system still experiencing
                                 hardware problems.  SUN to dispatch on 31
                                 July.

    VII.    It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, thru one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VIII.   D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen
            procedures to Netcon.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to provide informal hands-on
                                 training and document the code gen
                                 procedure prior to his departure for
                                 Paris.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel to complete by 1 August.

    IX.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

    X.      SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh to respond by next meeting.

    XI.     Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

    XII.    UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

    XIII.   Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

    XIV.    Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XV.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.

                   Action: 7/28  A.    J. Smith to document.
                                 B.    P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

    XVI.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

Present status as of 9AM Tuesday 2 August of recent NAD and BITS releases.

Operation genned 10 nodes via the new NAD on Monday, Netcon loaded Monday 
evening. All 10 loads failed with acircuit zapper message. P.Whitehurst had
her support person visit Netcon on Tuesday afternoon to witness several load
attempts, which failed also.

On Tusday morning, Pam reported that not only does BITS circuits get
zapped but other Unix outbound call circuits get zapped as well. Pam to get
XCOM assistance from G.Walker and system support from C.Baltrunas

At present it is unclear why circuits are being zapped.

Mary, can you inform me when QA will complete release tests on the new NAD
and BITS that was simultaneously released to QA and the Public Net last
week? Perhaps the problem we are experiencing right now is due to different
enviroments in BUBBNET and Fremont.

Eric, the permissions were not setup correctly yesterday. The were reestablished
today so the problem should not be there anymore. We are enabling an
automatic way so this function will not have to be done manually any longer.

I want to thank those field techs that have tested the new release of NAD
and BITS. Without field accpetance tests of these programs we will
not get this program restarted. Keep genning and loading all the test slots 
you can. Even though BITS has another known problem (error code 51)
some other interesting points have come from your feedback.


I would like to hear from PMTS about genning and testing your interfaces
and FSC on validations and loading of diagnostics.

Thanks,

Prior to Carl Baltrunas departing for two weeks hard earned vacation time I 
want to call a program review meeting. Time is 2 pm to 3:30 pm on Tuesday 8 
August in conference room C5-645 (the usual place).

The purpose is to smooth the transition for the interim system support being
provided by Joe Smith (FSC) and Osman Guven (Neteng) in Carl's absence.

Beginning at 3:30 will be a report by D.Hopkins on his evaluation
of USECURE, a Unix security package. If you receive this message you're invited.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after PDP
                to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned that
                UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled twice,
                whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked to 
                assemble patches twice an operand out of range error is
                reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


            1.A.3  Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.  Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.3  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

            1.B.4  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This

                                 from minutes.

    IV.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            4.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                                 of this progress on the program.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Michel discussed requirements with J.
                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.

                   Update: 8/4   L. Reed is satisfied she knows how to use
                                 this script.  She'll use this script for
                                 node gens during test period.


            4.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas presently working on
                                 program, will be ready by 1 August.

                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated

                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

                                 C. Baltrunas to implement program
                                 controlled method in conjunction with

    V.      It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            5.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - AES - now participating.

                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            5.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            5.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            5.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.

                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.


                   Update: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VIII.   D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen
            procedures to Netcon.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Michel to provide informal hands-on
                                 training and document the code gen
                                 procedure prior to his departure for
                                 Paris.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel to complete by 1 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Michel had meeting with a Netcon rep.
                                 item closed.

    IX.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

    X.      SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh to respond by next meeting.

    XI.     Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guvan and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    XII.    UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.


                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

    XIII.   Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

    XIV.    Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XV.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.


                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.

                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

                   Update: 8/4   A. -  Need banner message and update Tech
                                       Tip file for completion.
                                 B. -  Closed.
                                 C. -  C. Baltrunas - incomplete.
 
    XVI.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 Bits release.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                                 since there is another escalation it is
                                 considered complete.

    III.    P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            3.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to

                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.
                                 Smith's program.

                   Update: 8/4   L. Reed is satisfied she knows how to use
                                 this script.  She'll use this script for
                                 node gens during test period.

            3.1.B  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to meet with D. Sakai to
                                 understand code back up requirements.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas presently working on
                                 program, will be ready by 1 August.

                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated
                                 completion is 28 July 1989.

    IV.     It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            4.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            4.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            4.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            4.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are
                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.

    VI.     It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.

                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VII.    D. Murtaugh requested that P. Michel's document code gen

                                 training and document the code gen
                                 procedure prior to his departure for
                                 Paris.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel to complete by 1 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Michel had meeting with a Netcon rep.
                                 item closed.

    VIII.   Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.



                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

    IX.     SA training is a weakness area because NETQA's only trained
            SA resigned.

                   Action: 7/24  D. Murtaugh to schedule NETQA staff to
                                 attend SUN SA school.  Don to update on
                                 training schedule.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh to respond by next meeting.

    X.      Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guvan and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    XI.     UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

 


    XII.    Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

    XIII.   Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XIV.    It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.


                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point

                                 C. -  C. Baltrunas - incomplete.
 
    XV.     PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release.

re: BITS escalation

The attached message arrived as a result of field testing of the 7/28 release
of BITS. I am unsure if he has sent this to you directly but I wanted to be
sure you are aware of it so I am sending it myself.

Please review and let me know if he has found something new.

I've been beating on Bits and have come across an interesting bug that you
may or may not know about.  When trying to do a multiple slot load, bits
fails thinking that its been given a bad object file.  The error is
repeatable but is dependent on the nature and order of the files.  A
transcript of the error follows.  The engine used, which is in my lab, is
node 2731.  Slots 2 and 4 are TII gateways, slot 3 is a Tymcom, and slot 5
is X.PC.

One other thing I find annoying is not being able to cleanly abort bits
before the load starts, e.g. at a filename prompt.  Consider the case where
you specified the wrong slot number and want to abort.  Hitting
control-c eventually gets you out but with a core dump.

________________________________________________________________

Additional delay is apparent.  Present bits problems are the
only cause now.  I'll report more on present status later, but
first, I want to provide you with the framework on a migration
schedule once we begin migrations.
 
Week 1, Day 1 - Nodes 2127, 2143, 2146, 2167, 2207, 2211,
                2335, 2424, 2404, and 2407.
 
        Day 2 - Node Range 2011 - 2047.
 
        Day 3 - Node Range 2050 - 2125.
 
        Day 4 - Node Range 2126 - 2200.
 
        Day 5 - Node Range 2221 - 2342.
 
Week 2, Day 1 - First 100 nodes in the 2342 - 4000 range.
 
      Day 2-5 - 100 nodes per day.
 
Weeks 3 through 10 - 100 nodes per day, 500 per week.
 
After 10 weeks of migration, we shall turn-off systems
25, 54, and 33.
 
One week ahead of time, myself, with assistance from PI, will
announce the definative range of nodes to be converted, giving
7 days notice.
 
At least for the first 2 - 4 weeks, the only nodes that will be
converted are Public Net nodes located in the Continental U.S.
excluding nodes in Subnets, ACS, FSC, PMTS, and nodes with 
peripherals (disks and tapes).  Therefore, I urge those people
involved with customers and/or products on the (temporary)
exception list to think about and document your plans and
requirements to me so that we can look after our customers.
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
PRESENT STATUS - CK node, Look, Get, Unget and Put programs
are available for use.  A system banner message provides a 
pointer to a man page on how and when to use the utilities.
 


Please continue to test using present releases of NAD and
Bits - IT HELPS!  Also, the backup systems in Malvern are
installed and operational.  Please log into these systems
and test that they have the same "Look and Feel" as Fremont
and everything operates as it does on Fremont.

1. Malvern host numbers are 10655 and 10663.
2. MAN pages for prgrams are now in place.
3. Banner messages are now in place.

Points 2 and 3 were simply timing matters, my OnTyme was sent prior to this
work being done.

re: BITS 2.10 release dated 8/8

The BITS release received yesterday failed again. I scheduled 10 campus
nodes for reload and again, all 10 failed to complete the loads. The same
error message for all failed loads was communicated to you by L.Reed today.
For those on the CC list benefit the reported error was

re: Copying file to other UNIX directories

Please copy .cshrc file to ../.../.cshrc then request all CTS users to copy
from ../.../.cshrc to their own directory and name it .cshrc

this should do it, although it is klugy. After we get the migration moving
in a orderly manner I will assign system programmers to the task of making
system improvements. This is a candidate.

If you have any difficulties, re-submit and I'll get one of my support people
to work with you on it.

re: Reported NAD problem

Several weeks ago before the most recent NAD release it was reported that NAD
did not build circuits used for debugging. A new release of NAD dated 7/28
was supposed to fix this problem. I would like field tech confirmation that
it is fixed. Please test and reply.

    I.      FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.


                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.


                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.

                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommended that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release and so will observation
                                 of nodes failing to come up after Load.

                   Action: 8/8   NTD made a second release of Bits (2.10
                                 dated 8/8/89) to Program Management on

                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.

            D.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    II.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

            2.1.A  Action: 7/14  P. Michel to meet with J. Smith to
                                 specify requirements of point A above.

                                 Smith on 14 July 1989.  No feedback
                                 since.  Also, C. Baltrunas asked NTD to
                                 think about allowing background jobs to
                                 run slower then they presently run.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Michel tested satisfactorily on T.

                                 that this program is ready prior to
                                 restarting the project.  It is of
                                 critical importance.

                   Update: 8/8   Item complete.  C. Baltrunas instructed
                                 PI how to process update (name changed
                                 from backup) requests.  C. Baltrunas

            2.1.C  Action: 7/14  C. Baltrunas to develop program that
                                 updates a UNIX file, accessible by all
                                 UNIX system users, when a node is
                                 successfully commented to UNIX.  Present
                                 method will be when Netcon successfully
                                 loads a node from UNIX, Netcon will
                                 manually key in the node number to the
                                 program which will update the system
                                 file.

                   Update: 7/24  C. Baltrunas reports the program is being
                                 developed right now.  Estimated

                   Action: 8/8   J. Smith to instruct Netcon how to update
                                 the node conversion list program.


            2.1.D  Action: 7/14  Due to the anticipated volume of 
                                 conversions (100 per day), manual
                                 movement of code from netload to PI load
                                 will be unwieldy.

    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC participation has been less than satisfactory. 
                   Several phone calls have been made to FSC Management to
                   understand their requirements.

                   Update: 7/25  R. Ferguson has reported that FSC
                                 Regional Tech Support personnel are
                                 trained on UNIX Systems and are


                                 conducting further training to Districts
                                 and Engineers.  He also reports that FSC
                                 is instructing Engineers to call Netcon
                                 to perform loads if the are not all
                                 trained by the time the migration
                                 restarts.  Relying on Netcon is
                                 unsatisfactory.  FSC says they must use
                                 Netcon because DLoad is they only user
                                 name valid in Bits and FSC doesn't have
                                 the password.

                   Action: 7/25  D. Murtaugh to reply on this matter to H.

                                 R. Ferguson also reports that T. Kochman
                                 will call C. Baltrunas for a UNIX
                                 directory to store Eng diag.  Also, he is
                                 working with Validations to establish FSC
                                 user name directories on the SUN's.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Murtaugh is satisfied with FSC calling
                                 Netcon for all loads.

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 7/24  Network connections to Malvern SUN's

                                 Fremont System images.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.





                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

    VII.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on Usecure
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefullness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissable programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 exceute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

    IX.     Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

 


    X.      Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XI.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Action: 7/24  Discuss at next meeting the idea of
                                 seconding 1-2 Technical Field Staff for a
                                 short period.

                   Update: 7/28  It is determined that the most important
                                 documents required is:  a) operating
                                 instructions for the node, get, put, look
                                 and unget scripts; b) code gen
                                 procedures; c) back-up procedures; d) how
                                 to check if a node is converted to UNIX.

                   Action: 7/28  A. -  J. Smith to document.
                                 B. -  P. Michel to document, see point
                                       VIII.
                                 C./D. C. Baltrunas and Donna Sakai to
                                       document.

                   Update: 8/4   A. -  Complete.
                                 B. -  Complete.
                                 C./D. Baltrunas - complete.
 
    XII.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HARRY,
 
   I HAVE FOOLED AROUND WITH NAD AND WE ARE INDEED ABLE TO BUILD CIRCUITS
TO THE KERNELS FOR RUNNING DIAGS. HOWEVER, THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME OTHER
BUGS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT.
 
   1) THE PROCESS IS A BIT SLOW COMPAIRED TO THE PDP-10'S BUT I FEEL THIS
      NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.
 
   2) ONCE YOU'RE INTO THE SLOT THE ONLY COMMAND THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO
      WORK IS "::?HIST". WHEN IT IS ISSUED THE CIRCUIT GETS ZAPPED.
 
   3) WE ARE ABLE TO LOG INTO EXTENDED DDT BUT ARE UNABLE TO ISSUE ANY
      COMMANDS ONCE THERE. THIS SEEMS TO BE TRUE NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF
      INTERFACE YOU'RE LOGGED INTO. THIS WILL CAUSE MAJOR HEARTBURN
      AMONG US CS TYPES.
 
 
   IF THERE IS ANY THING I CAN DO OR ANY TESTING YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO
PERFORM JUST LET ME KNOW.
 
 
 
 
                                                BEST REGARDS,
 
 
                                                DAN...

When performing a directory listing the year is not shown because all present
files on the Unix systems were created this year. If you execute a 
directory command and there are files created in previous years these will
be shown.

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            1.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            1.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.


                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            B.   Bits vs. Loadii Load Times

                 J. Snavely produced definitive evidence that Bits takes 
                 longer to load nodes and slots than Loadii.

            1.B.1  Action: 7/11  J. Alcantara to test load same nodes and
                                 slots as J. Snavely from Netcon on SUN 
                                 System.
                   Update: 7/14  J. Alcantara reported slower load time
                                 from Netcon SUN than Fremont SUN.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported NTD has programmed
                                 speed improvement into Bits and is
                                 testing in Bubbnet to verify actual speed
                                 improvements.  Target release of new Bits
                                 version to Operations is 25 July.

                   Update: 7/28  NTD released new NAD and Bits on 27 July.
                                 C. Baltrunas installed on Fremont and
                                 Malvern on 28 July.  All Field is asked
                                 to test ten and load labs nodes using new
                                 NAD and Bits and report all faults.

                   Update: 8/4   NTD fixed a Bits condition when a node in
                                 the load path lost a record, it returned
                                 a message to Bits which called a Tymlib
                                 routine and zapped the circuit.

                   Update: 8/8   Bits release dated 8/8/89 failed.  NTD
                                 witnessed loads and made changes.

                   Update: 8/16  Bits release dated 8/16/89 failed.

                   Action: 8/17  UNIX team members will witness Bits
                                 testing in Netcon tonight.

            1.B.2  Action: 7/11  C. Baltrunas to reconfigure Tymnet and
                                 Sunlink X.25 parameters to match
                                 settings recommendations of informed UNIX
                                 system operators around the San Jose
                                 campus.

                   Update: 7/24  Incomplete.  Two of six are complete, but
                                 all work must be redone to install a
                                 mandatory X.25 patch.  C. Baltrunas
                                 targets Tuesday, 25 July as complete
                                 date.

                   Action: 7/28  C. Baltrunas to reload the remaining X.25
                                 slots.


                   Update: 7/28  Carried out recommended changes X.25 and
                                 several other patches introduced
                                 failures.  C. Baltrunas removed other new
                                 patches and things are stabilized.  No
                                 further changes will be introduced to
                                 X.25.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommended that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/17  This change will take place after 24
                                 August.

            1.B.3  It is reported by P. Michel that approximately 25% of 
                   nodes loaded from UNIX during last months beta test
                   trial did not come up into the network.  NCC verified
                   this when nodes successfully loaded by Bits for timing
                   tests did not come up.

                   Action: 7/14  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported a Bits fix that
                                 prevents segment E corruptions.  This
                                 will be released to OPS, as scheduled in
                                 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  The new Bits is reported to be 60% faster
                                 than the old.  NETQC is to take code
                                 genned by PI and load nodes tested in
                                 point 1.B.1 and report Load times on 1
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/4   P. Whitehurst to release a new NAD by
                                 Tuesday.  Speed test will be conducted
                                 upon new release and so will observation
                                 of nodes failing to come up after Load.

                   Action: 8/8   NTD made a second release of Bits (2.10
                                 dated 8/8/89) to Program Management on
                                 Tuesday afternoon.  C. Baltrunas to
                                 install in Fremont on Tuesday evening.
                                 L. Reed to instruct Netcon to Load the
                                 ten (10) campus nodes, using Bits dated
                                 8/8/89 and report results.  Also, Netcon
                                 to do timing tests on same three nodes as
                                 was performed three (3) weeks ago.
                                 Report results to H. Matthews on 9
                                 August.

                   Update: 8/17  Alleged Bits speed improvements yet to be
                                 verified as last two Bits releases have
                                 not loaded nodes.  Furthermore, the
                                 report that some nodes do not come into
                                 Network after Bits loads remains
                                 unverified.


            C.   Field reports that UNIX NAD does not build circuits
                 required for debugging.

            1.C.1  Action: 7/11  Fault reported to P. Whitehurst for
                                 investigation and resolution.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported that a new release
                                 of UNIX NAD is being prepared to fix this
                                 problem.  Release scheduled as in 1.B.2.

                   Update: 7/28  Problems caused by wrong library released
                                 with last NAD.  New library released with
                                 present NAD, furthermore, new NAD
                                 releases cannot be run with old libraries
                                 because of change implement by NTD.

                   Update: 8/4   Problem reported fixed, to be verified
                                 during Field trials.

            D.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            1.D.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            E.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            1.E.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    II.     P. Michel stressed PI's need for: a) multiple node gen scripts
            (that run in background); b) effective code back up
            procedures; c) program controlled method to keep track of
            which nodes have been UNIX converted; and d) an automated
            method to move codes from netload to PI load.

                   Update: 8/17  Item Closed.



    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

                   Update: 8/17  Validations waiting signed individual
                                 security agreements before validating FSC
                                 on SUN Systems.


    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Action: 7/14  It is required that Field Techs log into
                                 the server where their directory is
                                 located.  P. Kiefer to communicate this
                                 requirement to the Field.
                   Update: 7/24  Since the decision was made to delay the
                                 project last week, SUN activity by the
                                 Field is low, therefore, it is as yet
                                 undetermined how effective elective load
                                 balancing is.  It will be reviewed as
                                 Field activity resumes.

                   If elective load balancing is ineffective then
                   mandatory load balancing (via NETVAL home hosts) shall
                   be implemented.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

    VII.    Daily updates of PDP changes to Fremont SUN's.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is


            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.

                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on USECURE
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefulness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissible programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 execute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

                   Update: 8/17  NTTR.

    IX.     Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.


                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.
 
    X.      Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

    XI.     It is a concern that documented policies and procedures are
            not in place for the various departments and activities for
            the UNIX migration.  These department requiring documentation
            is PI, Netcon, SA (NETQC) and Field Tech Support.  Activities
            which require documentation is backup procedure, code gen,
            system administrator, escalations and order processing for
            software distribution, once we have migrated to UNIX.

            Given present project activities, we are unable to prepare
            these documents without further delaying the migration since
            the people working project activities are the only ones
            capable of writing the documents.  Therefore, some other plan
            must be arranged that delivers the necessary documents.

                   Update: 8/17  Complete, item closed.

    XII.    PI to gen Field test nodes and get slot code for target nodes
            outlined in H. Matthews Ontyme message number 65503.  Once
            ready, these nodes will be converted to UNIX late in the week 
            of 31 July.

                   Update: 8/4   This activity failed when Bits load did
                                 work.  It will resume when we receive the
                                 new Bits release and loading problems are
                                 resolved.


   XIII.    J. Smith or O. Guven to train Netcon how to use the CKnode
            Program.  This will be scheduled prior to live migration.

SUBJECT>   New mass edit programs for CONSAT


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This memo documents the release of three new mass edit programs to
update the SOLO CONSAT and ISIS CONSAT command files and tymfiles.
All of these programs take as input a node number list file. The
following table lists the program name, function, and input file name:
 
    PROGRAM	     FUNCTION		     INPUT FILE NAME
    =======	     ========		     ===============
1. CMDSOL.SAV	MODIFIES SOLO COMMAND FILES    CMDSOL.DIR
2. TYSOL.SAV	MODIFIES SOLO TYMFILES	       CMDSOL.DIR
3. CMDSIS.SAV	MODIFIES ISIS CONSAT FILES     CMDSIS.DIR
 
Contact Abe Mendez for more information on the use of these programs
for the Tymnet nodes. Please do NOT use these programs without
checking with Abe first!!!
 
To run each program type RUN followed by the program name and press
the enter key; e.g for the solo consat :
 
		      RUN CMDSOL
 
will fire up CMDSOL.SAV, which will read node numbers from the
CMDSOL.DIR file. The CMDSOL.DIR file can contain a list of nodes like:
 
			 3106
                                                                Page  2

			 3144
 
The limit on the number of nodes is currently about 20,000.
 
Both CMDSOL and TYSOL share the same input file, CMDSOL.DIR. The
CMDSIS program requires a separate input file, CMDSIS.DIR .
 
These input lists can be used repeatedly for more modifications later
if we need them.  We can also move them to the UNIX environment later
as input files for the UNIX tools (yet to be developed).
 
I have tested the above 3 programs, and they work fine. They will not
damage already modified command files / tymfiles. Abe has
already used CMDSOL (the Solo Consat program) successfully.
 
Please call if you have further questions.
 
Best Regards,
 
K.L.Narayan

Subject: SETOP :: OPPS 

Vida & Cynthia,
  As per our discussion on Friday, OPPS has now been modified to allow
users to change their OPER passwords and update the NEW setop data files.
OPPS is now ONLY on system D34.

  A possibly new feature is that a manager need not run SETOP just to
change a user's OPER password, whereas previously you were only allowed
to change your own password with OPPS.  It now validates the user by
requesting an opername and password, then allows the user to change any
opername that is on that user's particular branch.

As you all are aware, we have encountered a hardware problem on the Sun 
Systems which has affected the access to these systems.  (Timing is 
everything in life.)  Since there is no testing time available for the 
field people prior to the Beta test scheduled on 6/19, we have slipped this
date one week.  Beta Test is now scheduled for the week of June 26.  This 
slippage will not affect any other dates previously discussed for 
production migration.


                            CONVERSION SCHEDULE

6/6       Train the trainer.

6/7-6/22  Field testing of Gen and Load.  Field Tech Specialists, Field 
          Service Co., Payment Systems Co., and P.I. Gen and Load lab 
          machines to become familiar with system structure, commands, and
          procedures.

6/19-6/22 Gen and Load nodes at McDonnell Douglas campus and Network 
          Supervisors.

6/19      Projects for Beta Test are identified.  A list of projects 
          including all nodes and slots is distributed to be used for Beta
          Test the week of 6/26.  This list should include projects in as 
          many districts as possible to give the widest possible 
          involvement.  All changes should be done on the PDP 10's this 
          week and nodes genned to have .BND files available if needed.

6/23      All .TYM files and .CMD files are moved to the Sun Systems.  
          Begin generation of .NIB files, both node and slot for Beta Test
          projects.  If any slot is involved in a project, all slots and 
          node code will be genned and reloaded from Unix.  If any node is
          involved for line reconfiguration, etc., all slots will also be 
          done on the Unix System.  We cannot have half the production code
          for a node on Sun and half on the PDP 10.

6/26      Begin Beta Test.  All node and slots will be loaded from the Sun
          Systems.  Any error or problems encountered will be reported to 
          Phillippe Michel for node code, the responsible Tech Specialist 


          for slot code, or Carl Baltrunas for systems problems.  First 
          attempt will be to correct the problem, .TYM or .CMD file errors 
          corrected, versions verified, etc.  If resolution is not 
          possible, then fall back to the project code (.BND file) on the 
          PDP 10.  All problems encountered, whether resolved or resulting 
          in a fall back to the .BND file, should be documented in an 
          ontyme to Carl Baltrunas (TXS.C/BALTRUNAS) and Jack Snavely 
          (NSC.J/SNAVELY).

6/30      End Beta Test.  Resume normal operations on the PDP 10's.

7/5-7/7   Evaluation - Any difficulties during Beta Test resolved, loading
          statistics analyzed, and all user directories moved to Unix.

7/7       All .TYM and .CMD files moved to the Sun Systems.

7/10      All new Gens begin on Sun Systems.  Projects for this week will 
          be loaded from PDP 10's, but projects for the week of 7/17 will 
          be done on the Sun Systems.  In addition, all nodes in the 2000-
          2777 range not affected by projects will be scheduled to be 
          loaded from the Sun Systmes the week of 7/17.  This schedule will 
          be published 7/7 with the day for each load.  All slots and node
          code must be done, so insure your code is ready 2 days prior to 
          the load date.  If a slot has not been done prior to loading, 
          your customer will be down.  Expect to be called by Netcon.

7/17      Production - All new code loads will be done from the Sun 
          Systems.  This means that if a slot or node is reconfigured for 
          any reason, all slots and node code must be regenned on the Sun 
          System.

7/14      Schedule published for the migration of 3000-3777 range of nodes
          not yet involved in projects to be loaded the week of 7/14.
7/21      Schedule published for nodes in the 4000 to 5777 range to be 
          loaded the week of 7/31.

7/28      Schedule for all the nodes remaining to be loaded the weeks of 
          8/7 and 8/14.

8/14      Release System 25.

8/31      Release System 54.

9/29      Release System 33.

Jack;

     IRT the 8/14 power down date of system 25, and the subsequent 9/29
power down date of system 33, I have (9) nine sub-nets that use system
25 as a primary and 33 as a backup.  The subnets have not be scheduled
for conversion as of yet.  This is a matter that must be put into the
project schedule asap.

     Below is a list of the sub-nets under International Network
Services control.  This information had been submitted on 24 Apr by
Phil Kiefer.

re: Copying file to other UNIX directories

Please copy .cshrc file to ../.../.cshrc then request all CTS users to copy
from ../.../.cshrc to their own directory and name it .cshrc

this should do it, although it is klugy. After we get the migration moving
in a orderly manner I will assign system programmers to the task of making
system improvements. This is a candidate.

If you have any difficulties, re-submit and I'll get one of my support people
to work with you on it.

SUBJECT:  UNIX Migration Program Review Meeting No. 7


    I.      NEXT MEETING

            3:00 p.m. Friday 25 August C5-645.

    II.     FAULT REPORTS

            A.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            2.A.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            2.A.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed


                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodically for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

    B.      BITS 

            2.B.1  Bits testing this week show Load times in the 3-6 
                   minute range.  SUCCESS!  Thanks, P. Whitehurst and
                   A. Ko of NTD.

                   There are three related problems of unknown origin that
                   are presently being tested.  DLoading nodes genned and
                   loaded from UNIX; nodes not coming up after Bits Loads
                   and Loading slot codes in sequential order.

                   NTD believes they have a handle on these problems and
                   intend for a new Bits release on Thursday.

    C.      NAD

            2.C.1  Two open escalators to NTD.  One is a question:  how to
                   stop extended DOT display.  The next appears to be a
                   fault:  ? hist command zaps DOT circuit.

    D.      NETCOPY

            2.D.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

    E.      X.25

            2.E.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommends that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/22  This change will occur after 24 August,
                                 even though changes are occurring to X.25
                                 now for change control reasons.

            F.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            2.F.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.





                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  P. Whitehurst to check on fix status.

            G.   It is recommended that UNIX engines have the same memory
                 allocated to node code as PDP 10 engines.

            2.G.1  Action: 8/4   L. Reed to look at EBus:33 to compare
                                 node code memory sizes on PDP Engines to
                                 SUN Engines and report back to H.
                                 Matthews.

                   Update: 8/8   PDP-10 Engines have 350K assigned to node
                                 code, UNIX Engines has 225K.  It is
                                 agreed that the UNIX Engines will not be
                                 immediately upgraded since there is no
                                 compelling reason.

    III.    It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    Action: 7/11  S. Spinale to act as central point of
                                 contact for ACS and PMTS.

                   Update: 7/24  S. Spinale provided list of other people
                                 in PMTS and ACS that need to be aware of
                                 migrations.

                   Update: 7/28  T. Hackwood - ACS - now participating.

                   Update: 8/8   ACS working with NTD to prepare Ontyme
                                 code migration to UNIX.  T. Hackwood
                                 estimates this to require ACS development
                                 staff which will be unavailable until
                                 next week.

                                 PMTS - just moved their code to UNIX
                                 System, still evaluating all that is
                                 required to begin PMTS code migration.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  S. Spinale to provide an update on PMTS
                                 progress.  No report on migration access
                                 from ACS.

            3.2    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.3    P. Kiefer acts as central point of contact for all
                   nodes inside the U.S. under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisor, all subnets and private nets whose
                   contracts are U.S. based regardless of node locations.



            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

                   Update: 8/17  Validations waiting signed individual
                                 security agreements before validating FSC
                                 on SUN Systems.

                   Action: 8/22  FSC has requested that directories named
                                 Engdiag and betadiag are set up on the
                                 UNIX Systems.  J. Smith to complete.

    IV.     Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

    V.      It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Update: 8/22  Validations is setting up hosts for all
                                 Fremont and Malvern hosts in the USERS
                                 profile.  For now, the first home is the
                                 PDP-10, in the next class position will
                                 be the SUN Server, where the personnel
                                 directory resides, the next three class
                                 positions will have another Fremont
                                 server, then the two Malvern servers.

    VI.     Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Action: 7/11  H. Matthews to locate Lemcom expert.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to call Field personnel
                                 supporting Lemcoms and notify them of P.
                                 Whitehurst's expertise.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst identified as Lemcom
                                 expert.

                   Action: 7/28  NTD to work with Field to install and
                                 test UNIX Lemcom code.



                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  Shall resume now.

    VII.    DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                   Action: 8/4   C. Baltrunas to train O. Guven and J.
                                 Smith how and where to install the Files
                                 from the daily transfer.

                   Action: 8/22  Tests this week will call on the changed
                                 files to ensure the daily back-up is
                                 occurring properly.

    VIII.   UNIX SECURITY

            D. Hopkins is evaluating USECURE, a UNIX System Security
            package.  His evaluation will consist of testing to see that 
            USECURE provides, at minimum, the level of PDP-10 security we
            now have.  He'll document exceptions and anomalies.
            Furthermore, his tests will see if USECURE can keep privilege
            away from users, can it restrict root, can it provide tiered
            security levels, operate with NAD and Bits, and support
            permission level changes efficiently on an individual and
            global basis.

                   Update: 7/24  D. Hopkins report to be ready on 28 July
                                 1989.

                   Update: 7/28  Awaiting D. Hopkins report.

                   Update: 8/4   D. Hopkins, C. Baltrunas and H. Matthews
                                 will meet on 7 August to discuss his
                                 findings.




 



                   Update: 8/8   D. Hopkins provided briefing on USECURE
                                 evaluation.  He reported that a subset
                                 "UShell" may have some use although a key
                                 question to its usefulness remaining
                                 open.

                   Action: 8/8   D. Hopkins to verify that UShell will
                                 allow users the ability to use
                                 permissible programs, Shells and scripts,
                                 but will not allow them to command line
                                 execute the commands in the Shells
                                 programs on scripts.

                   Update: 8/17  NTTR.
    IX.     Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

                   Update: 8/22  Thom Kelley working to develop another
                                 plan release after meeting with SUN and
                                 NTD.

    X.      Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

                   Update: 8/22  Delivered.  Under first draft review.

    XI.     J. Smith or O. Guven to train Netcon how to use the CKnode
            Program.  This will be scheduled prior to live migration.




    XII.    PUBLIC NET SUPE LOADING

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith is assigned this task
            and the program shall be ready when the UNIX migration starts.

       I.   NEXT MEETING

            2:00 p.m. Thursday 7 September C5-645.

      II.   FAULT REPORTS

            2.A.1  Load Testing

                   Recent load testing has not helped to diagnose the
                   report that some nodes do not come up after BITS
                   load.  In fact, these tests have found some procedure
                   and training problems that are being addressed.  In
                   the meantime, the migration is delayed because some
                   nodes do not come up after loads from UNIX and Solo
                   Consats fail after loading.  NTD and R. Vivier are
                   investigating.

                   Action:  a) R. Vivier to resolve Solo Consat failures.
                            b) P. Whiteburst will have programmer in 
                               Netcon to personally conduct load tests
                               beginning on 5 September.
                            c) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  Either BITS does not have
                               this capability or it doesn't work.
                            d) H. Matthews to gain D. Murtaugh's agreement
                               to have NTD carry out Action Item (b).
                            e) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.
                            f) H. Matthews to provide Netcon the BITS
                               manual.



            B.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            2.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

            2.B.2  Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/24  P. Whitehurst reported program written.

                   Action: 7/24  P. Whitehurst to report when operations
                                 should invoke this program and how to
                                 use.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.   BITS 

            2.C.1  BITS testing this week show Load times in the 3-6 
                   minute range.  SUCCESS!  Thanks, P. Whitehurst and
                   A. Ko of NTD.

                   There are three related problems of unknown origin that
                   are presently being tested.  DLoading nodes genned and
                   loaded from UNIX; nodes not coming up after Bits Loads
                   and Loading slot codes in sequential order.

                   NTD believes they have a handle on these problems and
                   intend for a new Bits release on Thursday.

                   Update: 8/25  Testing shows no problem with DLoad.  NTD
                                 developer has been out sick so the 
                                 committed Thursday release was missed.
                                 P. Whitehurst reports that if we don't 
                                 get the new BITS releast today, we'll get
                                 it Monday.  This release will fix node
                                 startup problems.

                   Update: 8/31  See 2.A.1 but slow load times appear to
                                 have improved significantly.


   

            D.   NETCOPY

            2.D.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 8/25  P. Whitehurst to prepare another Netcopy
                                 release for today or Monday.

                   Update: 8/31  P. Whitehurst still required to deliver a
                                 new version of Netcopy.  We are running 
                                 an old release now.

            E.   X.25

            2.E.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommends that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Update: 8/22  This change will occur after 24 August,
                                 even though changes are occurring to X.25
                                 now for change control reasons.

                   Update: 8/25  C. Baltrunas to re-implement the called
                                 clearned and link speed patches on Boomer
                                 and Gemini.

            F.   Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

            2.F.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  P. Whitehurst to check on fix status.

                   Update: 8/25  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/31  P. Whitehurst will supply G. Walker with
                                 NSR number.  G. Walker will reply with
                                 status.



     III.   It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    PMTS is working right now to move all their code to
                   the UNIX systems.  Once completed, they'll compile
                   all code and report any assembly problems.  After
                   genning, it is strongly recommended this code is
                   loaded for testing.

            3.2    ACS requested the PASCAL compilers be installed on the
                   UNIX systems before they could begin testing.  This is
                   complete.

            3.3    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

            3.4    A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.

            3.5    FSC 

                   Action: 8/4   P. Diamond to reply on satisfaction of
                                 FSC validations.

                   Update: 8/17  Validations waiting signed individual
                                 security agreements before validating FSC
                                 on SUN Systems.

                   Action: 8/22  FSC has requested that directories named
                                 Engdiag and betadiag are set up on the
                                 UNIX Systems.  J. Smith to complete.

                   Update: 8/25  J. Smith cannot validate a user 
                                 directory.  This is a validations matter.

                   Update: 8/31  Engdiag and betadiag directories created.
                                 FSC validations are occurring.

                   Action: 8/31  It is R. Vivier's or FSC responsibility
                                 to move diagnostics to these directories,
                                 reassemble and test.

      IV.   Malvern SUN System to provide TYM and CMD file back up to
            Fremont.  It is required that Malvern has the same look and
            feel as Fremont.  To that end, C. Baltrunas is sending types
            containing directory structures from Fremont for Malvern
            installation.

                   Update: 8/17  Item complete, except for validations who
                                 is validating all Fremont users onto
                                 Malvern.

                   Update: 8/31  Issue dropped.




       V.   It is noted that all Field Techs are logging into the SUN
            Servers, through one host number.

                   Update: 8/22  Validations is setting up hosts for all
                                 Fremont and Malvern hosts in the USERS
                                 profile.  For now, the first home is the
                                 PDP-10, in the next class position will
                                 be the SUN Server, where the personnel
                                 directory resides, the next three class
                                 positions will have another Fremont
                                 server, then the two Malvern servers.

                   Update: 8/31  Issue dropped.

      VI.   Lemcom support needed.  Several Field requests came to HQ
            saying there are Lemcom Nib Files, but no TYM and CMD.
            Furthermore, Field did not know how to construct TYM and CMD 
            files for Lemcoms.

                   Update: 7/28  H. Matthews to inform Field to arrange
                                 tests with P. Whitehurst.

                   Update: 8/8   Testing underway.

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  Shall resume now.

     VII.   DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S.

            In order to keep the SUN's as up-to-date as possible on all
            PDP file changes PI is requesting daily PDP tapes to be sent
            from Dallas and installed on the SUN's.  C. Baltrunas has
            instructed operations where to load the files.  There may be
            some changes to the PDP's that have not moved to the SUN's
            because of a PDP system problem in Dallas last weekend.  It is
            our estimation that the amount of file difference between the
            systems is small and if any are noticed will be handled on an
            exception basis using Net Copy.

                   Update: 7/24  Daily tape shipments is occurring.

                   Update: 7/28  C. Baltrunas organized another entire
                                 system copy to be sent from Dallas that
                                 will close my holes caused by PDP
                                 failure.

                                 occurring properly.




                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

            in the Private and Subnet code systems.

      IX.   Software release procedures is being specified by Thom
            Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify the
            processes and interfaces by which software is moved from NTD
            to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code distribution
            via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES order.

                   Update: 7/24  T. Kelley report due in final draft form
                                 on 28 July 1989.

                   Action: 7/28  A staging directory name will be set up
                                 soon by C. Baltrunas.  When this is
                                 complete he will inform D. Houge at NTD.

                   Update: 7/28  D. Houge (NTD Program Management) should
                                 send the release tape to Fremont
                                 Operations in care of Rick Daniels.  Tape
                                 should be labeled "SUN Distribution
                                 Tape".

                   Update: 8/4   C. Baltrunas nominated the 'BASET' UNIX
                                 directory on Gemini as the NTD release
                                 directory.

                   Update: 8/22  Thom Kelley working to develop another
                                 plan release after meeting with SUN and
                                 NTD.

       X.   Marketing is preparing a services guide for Private and
            Subnetwork customers that use Tymnet operated SUN Systems
            for sysgens, storage and distribution.

                   Update: 7/24  J. McWalters has an action item to
                                 complete the services guide by 28 July
                                 1989.  Pricing for the services will
                                 follow shortly after.

                   Update: 7/28  Nothing new to report (NNTR).

                   Update: 8/22  Delivered.  Under first draft review.

      XI.   J. Smith or O. Guven to train Netcon how to use the CKnode
            Program.  This will be scheduled prior to live migration.




     XII.   PUBLIC NET MASS FILE CHANGE REQUESTS

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

    XIII.   It is noted that there are some features of load that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

       I.   NEXT MEETING

            2:00 p.m. Thursday 14 September C5-645.

      II.   FAULT REPORTS

            2.A.1  Load Testing

                   Recent load testing has not helped to diagnose the
                   report that some nodes do not come up after BITS
                   load.  In fact, these tests have found some procedure
                   and training problems that are being addressed.  In
                   the meantime, the migration is delayed because some
                   nodes do not come up after loads from UNIX and Solo
                   Consats fail after loading.  NTD and R. Vivier are
                   investigating.

                   Action:  a) R. Vivier to solve Solo Consat failures.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from R. Vivier

                            b) P. Whiteburst will have programmer in 
                               Netcon to personally conduct load tests
                               beginning on 5 September.

                   Update: 9/7   NTD scheduled for load tests tonight and
                                 tomorrow.  Tonight's load includes 14 
                                 nodes geographically dispersed including
                                 switchers and ISIS nodes.
 


                            c) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  Either BITS does not have
                               this capability or it doesn't work.

                   Update: 9/7   NTD development underway.

                            d) H. Matthews to gain D. Murtaugh's agreement
                               to have NTD carry out Action Item (b).

                   Update: 9/7   Murtaugh agrees.

                            e) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from L. Seltzer.

                            f) H. Matthews to provide Netcon the BITS
                               manual.

                   Update: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to release a BITS manual 
                                 via standard electronic release
                                 measures.  H. Matthews to inform
                                 D. Murtaugh when complete.

                            g) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

            B.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            2.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.




            C.   NETCOPY

            2.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 8/25  P. Whitehurst to prepare another Netcopy
                                 release for today or Monday.

                   Action: 8/31  P. Whitehurst still required to deliver a
                                 new version of Netcopy.  We are running 
                                 an old release now.

                   Update: 9.7   Due to experimental code in a Bubbnet SUN
                                 system, the new Netcopy release is 
                                 delayed until a more stable test 
                                 evironment is found.  Once this happens,
                                 Netcopy will be tested and released.

                 D.  X.25

            2.D.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommends that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Action: 8/25  C. Baltrunas to re-implement the called
                                 clearned and link speed patches on Boomer
                                 and Gemini.

                   Update: 9/7   C. Baltrunas to get appropriate passwords
                                 and carry out changes without further
                                 delay.

                   Action: 9/7   H. Matthews to contact D. Murtaugh to
                                 obtain formal mechanism for password
                                 updates.

            E.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                     reported a BBXS source bug.

            2.E.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 8/4   No action yet.  P. Whitehurst to
                                 complete.

                   Update: 8/8   NTTR.

                   Update: 8/16  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/22  P. Whitehurst to check on fix status.


                   Update: 8/25  NTTR.

                   Update: 8/31  P. Whitehurst will supply G. Walker with
                                 NSR number.  G. Walker will reply with
                                 status.

                   Update: 9/7   NSR No. 3075.  G. Walker states this
                                 problem requires a source code fix,
                                 therefore NTD must make the change.

                   Action: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to escalate to BBXS
                                 development manager.

     III.   It is clear that all network users that must be aware of and
            participate in the UNIX migration program have not been
            adequately represented in present discussions.

            3.1    PMTS is working right now to move all their code to
                   the UNIX systems.  Once completed, they'll compile
                   all code and report any assembly problems.  After
                   genning, it is strongly recommended this code is
                   loaded for testing.

                   Update: 9/7   PMTS has moved their code to the UNIX
                                 systems and performed test gens.  As a
                                 result, they have made an escalation and
                                 C. Baltrunas will review with PMTS.

            3.2    ACS requested the PASCAL compilers be installed on the
                   UNIX systems before they could begin testing.  This is
                   complete.

                   Update: 9/7   ACS has successfully test genned OnTyme
                                 code.

                   Action:  9/7  Test gen outdial and test load OnTyme
                                 code to a non-production system.

            3.3    J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

      XI.   It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 9/7   Meeting arranged on 11 September with 
                                 NTD and Netcon.

SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  Nightly load tests shows a 64% completion rate
                   since late August when success rate was 25%.  The
                   migration will begin when load success rates exceed
                   90%.



        I.  NEXT MEETING - 2:00 p.m. Thursday 21 September C5-645.

       II.  FAULT REPORTS

            2.A.1  Load Testing

                   Recent load testing has not helped to diagnose the
                   report that some nodes do not come up after BITS
                   load.  In fact, these tests have found some procedure
                   and training problems that are being addressed.  In
                   the meantime, the migration is delayed because some
                   nodes do not come up after loads from UNIX and Solo
                   Consats fail after loading.  NTD and R. Vivier are
                   investigating.

                   Action:  a) R. Vivier to solve Solo Consat failures.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from R. Vivier

                   Update: 9/14  R. Vivier tested with different nodes and
                                 and found no problem.

                   Update: 9/14  Testing will resume once 6.35 Consat
                                 problems are resolved.



                            b) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  

                   Update: 9/7   NTD development underway.


                            c) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from L. Seltzer.

                   Update: 9.14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff.

                            d) H. Matthews to provide Netcon the BITS
                               manual.

                   Update: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to release a BITS manual 
                                 via standard electronic release
                                 measures.  H. Matthews to inform
                                 D. Murtaugh when complete.

                   Update: 9/14  P Whitehurst has released to NTD Program
                                 Management who will release to the 
                                 Production System.

                            e) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

            B.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            2.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.



                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.   NETCOPY

            2.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 8/25  P. Whitehurst to prepare another Netcopy
                                 release for today or Monday.

                   Action: 8/31  P. Whitehurst still required to deliver a
                                 new version of Netcopy.  We are running 
                                 an old release now.

                   Update: 9/7   Due to experimental code in a Bubbnet SUN
                                 system, the new Netcopy release is 
                                 delayed until a more stable test 
                                 evironment is found.  Once this happens,
                                 Netcopy will be tested and released.

                   Update: 9/14  Netcopy is released to Production System.

            D.  X.25

            2.D.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Update: 8/8   B. Soley recommends that X.25 link speed
                                 be changed to 56kb, so that this
                                 parameter equals the line speed.

                   Action: 8/25  C. Baltrunas to re-implement the called
                                 clearned and link speed patches on Boomer
                                 and Gemini.

                   Update: 9/7   C. Baltrunas to get appropriate passwords
                                 and carry out changes without further
                                 delay.

                   Action: 9/7   H. Matthews to contact D. Murtaugh to
                                 obtain formal mechanism for password
                                 updates.

                   Update: 9/14  Password changes will be made available 
                                 so we can troubleshoot X.25. Furthermore,
                                 C. Baltrunas has implemented all X.25 
                                 changes as requested.



            E.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                     reported a BBXS source bug.

            2.E.1  Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst to submit NSR.

                   Update: 9/7   NSR No. 3075.  G. Walker states this
                                 problem requires a source code fix,
                                 therefore NTD must make the change.

                   Action: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to escalate to BBXS
                                 development manager.

                   Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The issue regarding Turbo code movement from Training and Documentation's Sun
to another Unix host requires clarification. The present plan is
that Operations will install a new server for Subnet customers and Turbo codes
and at the time this system is operational Turbo code can be moved from your
Sun. Management is trying to find budgeted captial to purchase this server and
an order has not been placed on Sun yet. The primary reason Turbo code
can't be moved to the Public net code gen systems in Fremont is because
customers access to those systems is not allowed, and customers access the
Turbo codes.

Should you require more information please call.

re: Attached Marketing Policy - Code Distribution

The attached policy is up for management review, acceptance and implementation.
You'll see it is very different from his first draft. It is open enough for
us to implement the policy as we see is in everyones best interests.

Should you have any comments, feed them back to me.



		TYMNET SOFTWARE 				 	DISTRIBUTION 			 POLICY

20 September 1989
Revision 1.1

This document contains competitive information and analysis not available in
published reports.  Much of this information relates to competitors and was
gathered by MDNSC at considerable effort and expense.  This document also
contains information related to current TYMNET products, product line
evolution, and marketing strategies and is the sole property of McDonnell
Douglas Corporation.

It is the obligation of every recipient of this document to guard its contents
against unauthorized disclosure.  Use security precautions of the highest order
when  handling this document.  Keep it under lock and key.  Do not photocopy
it.  Do not leave it unattended on a desk.  Do not read it in a public place.



Scope
 This document will describe the policy for how all Tymnet code will be
distributed to dedicated private network customers.  The intention of this
policy is to define and describe the mechanism on how
revisions/versions/patches of Tymnet code will be released and distributed to
the private network user.  For purposes of clarification, a major release will
be defined as a new release of software code which contains significant
enhancements or added features to the product.  Updates to a major release may
require the customer to purchase additional licenses.  A minor release will be
defined as an updated change to a version of software code which contains fixes
or patches but does not contain significant enhancements to the product.  Minor
releases do not require the purchase of additional licenses.  A patch release
will be defined as an interim fix to a release of software until the fix can be
added to a new release.  Customized patches (patches made by field personnel)
are excluded from this policy.

Software Releases Updates
Private network customers will be informed about new releases from the Product
Marketing department via a monthly Software Release Bulletin.  This bulletin
will be posted on ONTYME each month and will be available to all Tymnet field
representatives through ONTYME.  It will be the field representatives'
responsibility to inform customers about new releases.  The Software Release
Bulletin will provide detailed information regarding the latest releases of
Tymnet software including new product features and software modifications.  In
addition, the Software Release Bulletin will indicate what beta releases are
available, and the status of those beta releases.   The Software Release
Bulletin will also inform the field as to when a released version of software
will no longer be supported by Tymnet.



Patch Release Updates
Information regarding patches are provided by the Software Technical Services
(STS) department.  This information is available to all field personnel by
accessing ONTYME.  Patch release information and patch code can be obtained by
accessing the patch directory file.  Patch information will also be posted
periodically on ONTYME.  Patch release information will explain the original
problem, how it was resolved, and in which future release the patch will be
included.   

The Order Procedure
A private network customer will contact their respective Account Representative
in order to receive new software.  An order will be generated from Sales to the
Order Entry department requesting new software.  In order to aid Order Entry in
creating a customer profile, sales will be asked to complete the pre-site
survey sheet which must  be reviewed by the local System Engineer for
completeness and accuracy before it is sent.  The pre-site survey sheet will
allow Tymnet to determine what software is installed in the network and what
version number the customer is running.  

Order Entry/Finance will review the order, verify the customers' contracted
license requirements and then update the customer information into a database
maintained by finance.  The order will then be forwarded to the appropriate
departments for distribution.  Operations, upon the receipt of the order, will
compile the necessary software and maintain a record of the software that the
customer will be sent.  To order additional copies of software, customers will
need to contact their local representative.  Major releases of software
(containing significant enhancement value) may require additional licenses in
order for the customer to upgrade to that release. (This will vary depending
upon the product.)  A customer invoice will be generated upon the shipment of
the software.  Orders will be expedited according to the  order in which they
are received.  Delivery of software will remain consistent with the normal
Tymnet ordering processing time frames which exist today.




The Distribution Center
Code distribution will be managed by Operations at a Tymnet location.  When
code is released from NTD to Operations for distribution, it will be loaded
onto both public network Sun systems and Tymnet owned  "distribution systems".
This allows Tymnet to use and test the released code in the public network
environment.  The distribution systems will be used primarily to distribute
code to private networks.

The Distribution Procedure
Distribution of Releases/Versions
Patch updates to code may be transfered electronically if requested by the
customer.  Patches should be requested in an emergency situation only.  All new
releases of Tymnet code will be distributed from a tape media.  (Normally this
will be distributed on a 1/4" or 1/2" tape.)  Tymnet recognizes that
distributing software on a tape media is both costly and time consuming,
consequently Tymnet plans to eventually distribute all code via an electronic
transfer facility.  However, no date has been assigned for this requirement
yet.

9/21 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  Nightly load tests show a 64% completion rate
                   since late August when success rate was 25%.  The
                   migration will begin when load success rates exceed
                   90% over the period of 5 days.  The problems of load
                   hangs and nodes not coming coming up after reloads is
                   the main reason for migration delay, as it has been
                   for the last month.  Today, NTD has identified the
                   cause of one problem and can re-create the node hang
                   problem, therefore, fixes should be forthcoming.

      III.  FAULT REPORTS

            3.A.1  Load Testing

                           a) Recent load testing has not helped to
                              diagnose the report that some nodes do not
                              come up after BITS load.  In fact, these
                              tests have found some procedure and training
                              problems that are being addressed.  In the
                              meantime, the migration is delayed because
                              some nodes do not come up after loads from
                              UNIX and Solo Consats fail after loading. 

                   Update: 9/21  After installing a new X.25 patch, loads
                                 still fail.  Nodes do not come up after
                                 successful loads and loads hang in the
                                 middle of loading.  NTD identified a bug
                                 that stops nodes coming up and also can
                                 re-create the load hang problems, there-
                                 fore, fixes should be forthcoming.


                            b) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  

                   Update: 9/7   NTD development underway.

                            c) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from L. Seltzer.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                            d) H. Matthews to provide Netcon the BITS
                               manual.

                   Update: 9/7   P. Whitehurst to release a BITS manual 
                                 via standard electronic release
                                 measures.  H. Matthews to inform
                                 D. Murtaugh when complete.

                   Update: 9/14  P Whitehurst has released to NTD Program
                                 Management who will release to the 
                                 Production System.

                   Update: 9/21  Complete, item dropped.

                            e) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

            B.   SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error
                 is reported.

            3.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.



                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.   NETCOPY

            3.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 9/14  Netcopy is released to Production System.

                   Action: 9/21  C. Baltrunas to install.

            D.  X.25

            3.D.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Action: 9/7   H. Matthews to contact D. Murtaugh to
                                 obtain formal mechanism for password
                                 updates.

                   Update: 9/14  Password changes will be made available 
                                 so we can troubleshoot X.25. Furthermore,
                                 C. Baltrunas has implemented all X.25 
                                 changes as requested.

                   Update: 9/21  X.25 back pressure patches implemented on
                                 9/18.  Load hang problem still present, 
                                 so is the problem where nodes do not come
                                 up after reload.

            E.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                reported a BBXS source bug.

            3.E.1  Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.

                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.
      IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

            4.1    PMTS

                   Update: 9/7   PMTS has moved their code to the UNIX
                                 systems and performed test gens.  As a
                                 result, they have made an escalation and
                                 C. Baltrunas will review with PMTS.



                   Update: 9/14  C. Baltrunas reviewed PMTS NAD excalation
                                 and has passed onto NTD as it is a NAD
                                 bug.

            C. Fletcher to look at and recommend security implementations
            in the Private and Subnet code systems.

    VIII.   Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing

                                 issues.






       X.   Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

      XI.   It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 9/7   Meeting arranged on 11 September with

      III.  FAULT REPORTS

            3.A.1  Load Testing

                           a) Recent load testing has not helped to
                              diagnose the report that some nodes do not
                              come up after BITS load.  In fact, these
                              tests have found some procedure and training
                              problems that are being addressed.  In the
                              meantime, the migration is delayed because
                              some nodes do not come up after loads from
                              UNIX and Solo Consats fail after loading. 

                   Update: 9/21  After installing a new X.25 patch, loads
                                 still fail.  Nodes do not come up after
                                 successful loads and loads hang in the
                                 middle of loading.  NTD identified a but
                                 that stops nodes coming up and also can
                                 re-create the load hang problems, there-
                                 fore, fixes should be forthcoming.

                   Update: 9/28  New BITS release to fix nodes not coming
                                 up.  NTD has retracked their claim that 
                                 load hangs can be recreated.  Another
                                 method to trap and identify this bug must
                                 be found.

                            b) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  

                   Update: 9/7   NTD development underway.


                            c) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/7   Waiting status from L. Seltzer.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                            d) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

            B.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned   
                that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled 
                twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked 
                to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error 
                is reported.

            3.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.  NETCOPY

            3.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 9/14  Netcopy is released to Production System.

                   Action: 9/21  C. Baltrunas to install.

                   Update: 9/28  C. Baltrunas to completed by 9/29.


            D.  X.25

            3.D.1  J. Smith is implementing changes to X.25, so that
                   parameter mismatch that caused Bits Load failures is
                   fixed.

                   Action: 9/7   H. Matthews to contact D. Murtaugh to
                                 obtain formal mechanism for password
                                 updates.

                   Update: 9/14  Password changes will be made available 
                                 so we can troubleshoot X.25. Furthermore,
                                 C. Baltrunas has implemented all X.25 
                                 changes as requested.

                   Update: 9/21  X.25 back pressure patches implemented on
                                 9/18.  Load hang problem still present, 
                                 so is the problem where nodes do not come
                                 up after reload.

                   Update: 9/28  Issue dropped.

            E.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                reported a BBXS source bug.

            3.E.1  Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.

                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.

       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

              4.1  PMTS

                   Update: 9/7   PMTS has moved their code to the UNIX
                                 systems and performed test gens.  As a
                                 result, they have made an escalation and
                                 C. Baltrunas will review with PMTS.

                   Update: 9/14  C. Baltrunas reviewed PMTS NAD excalation
                                 and has passed onto NTD as it is a NAD
                                 bug.

                   Action: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned the escalation
                                 to her staff for debugging.

                   Update: 9/21  PMTS is half done testing of their 
                                 production slots in the Public Network.
                                 A. Martell reports 100% success.  
                                 Awaiting information from M. Marshall.
                                 All testing will be complete by October 
                                 1.



                   Update: 9/28  PMTS escalation shows a NAD bug that
                                 requires a NAD change.  This bug should
                                 have little impact on PMTS or other
                                 future NAD users.  PMTS changed things 
                                 for a near term work around solution.

              4.2  ACS 

                   Action:  9/7  Test gen outdial and test load OnTyme
                                 code to a non-production system.

                   Update: 9/14  ACS reports successful OnTyme code gen
                                 and load into a multi-meg lab engine.

                   Action: 9/14  ACS to gen and load outdial code.  Also,
                                 ACS should test in OnTyme on a production
                                 system.  Furthermore, ACS should clarify
                                 reason for Fortran 77 request.

                   Update: 9/21  ACS genned outdial code and determined

                                 modification.  ACS development is working
                                 on this and will look at all their
                                 requirements.

            in the Private and Subnet code systems.

     VIII.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.

                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

       IX.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.



        X.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 9/7   Meeting arranged on 11 September with 
                                 NTD and Netcon.

Two of the last three days testing shows 100% load success rates. If 
tonights (Friday) goes as well we'll start the migration on Monday 16
October. The first nodes on Monday will be 2127, 2143, 2146, 2167, 2207, 2211
2335, 2424, 2404 and 2407. Day two is the node range 2011-2047. Day three
is the node range 2050-2125. Day four node range is 2126-2200. Day five (or
Friday October 20) is node range 2221-2342.

By close of business Monday I will have a more detailed letter covering
policies and procedures of the migration. I would like a conference call
on Tuesday or Wednesday after you've had time to read my message Monday to
cover any questions.

10/5 SIGNIFICANT NEWS:  This week load testing shows success rates 
                        climbing above 70%.  A plan is in place to trap
                        the last known BITS bug. The migration will
                        start after the cause of this bug is found and a
                        fix is delivered, implemented and tested. The
                        time line could be as soon as 16 October, 
                        although I'll notify everyong directly in more
                        detail via OnTyme.

      III.  FAULT REPORTS

            3.A.1  Load Testing

                   Update: 10/5  A plan to trap the last known BITS bug
                                 is in place.  A BITS release on 9/28
                                 fixes the problem where nodes do not come
                                 up after reload.  This bug is the only
                                 remaining obsticle to beginning the
                                 migration.

                            b) NTD to add the capability to break out of
                               a BITS load.  

                   Update: 10/5  NTD delivered on 9/28 BITS release.  The
                                 method to escape the BITS load is to hit
                                 your UNIX excape character (usually CNTRL
                                 C).

                   Action: 10/5  L. Chavez to have Netcon verify this 
                                 works.

                            c) L. Seltzer to get equivalent file 
                               capability working.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                   Update: 10/5  Development underway.



                            d) PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 
                               5.33 node code with 6.35 of Consat in 
                               tonight or tomorrow night's load schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

            B.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned   
                that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled 
                twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked 
                to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error 
                is reported.

            3.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.  NETCOPY

            3.C.1  Present version of Netcopy does not work.  Apparently,
                   it is released to operate on SUNOS 3.5.  P. Whitehurst
                   to investigate and cause a release of the proper 
                   program.

                   Update: 9/14  Netcopy is released to Production System.

                   Action: 9/21  C. Baltrunas to install.

                   Update: 9/28  C. Baltrunas to completed by 9/29.

                   Update: 10/5  Complete, item dropped.


            D.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                reported a BBXS source bug.

            3.D.1  Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.

                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.

       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

              4.1  PMTS

                   Update: 9/28  PMTS escalation shows a NAD bug that
                                 requires a NAD change.  This bug should
                                 have little impact on PMTS or other
                                 future NAD users.  PMTS changed things 
                                 for a near term work around solution.

                   Update: 10/5  A. Martell and A. Marshall report that 
                                 all PMTS production code has been 
                                 successfully genned and loaded.  PMTS is
                                 confident to migrate to UNIX once BITS is
                                 changed to allow multiple load users on
                                 separate passwords.

                                 T. Srukhosit is encouraged to attend 
                                 these meetings to explain the effects on 
                                 PMTS operations of the NAD bug.  NTD and
                                 PMTS will work closer to explain PMTS and
                                 problems so that NTD can fix.

              4.2  ACS 

                   Update: 9/21  ACS genned outdial code and determined
                                 that outdial source (PASCAL) requires
                                 modification.  ACS development is working
                                 on this and will look at all their
                                 requirements.

                   Update: 10/5  ACS reports that outdial code will not be
                                 modified to run under UNIX.

              4.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

              4.4  A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.



              4.5  FSC 

                   Update: 8/31  Engdiag and betadiag directories created.
                                 FSC validations are occurring.

                   Action: 8/31  It is NTS's responsibility to move
                                 diagnostics to these directories,
                                 reassemble and test.

                   Update: 9/7   NTS has been asked to move diagnostics to
                                 the UNIX systems and recompile.

                   Update: 9/28  Diagnostics have not been moved to UNIX
                                 systems and recompiled because NTS
                                 has not signed the Security Agreement 
                                 yet.

              4.6  LEMCOMS

                   Update: 8/22  Testing temporarily delayed until Load
                                 problems were solved.  

                   Update: 9/21  P. Whitehurst to instruct Field people
                                 to test gen and load LEMCOM under UNIX.

        V.  DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S

                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

                   Update: 9/21  Item on hold, retesting will occur prior
                                 to migration.

       VI.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.

      VII.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.



                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

     VIII.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

       IX.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 10/5  P. Whitehurst is assembling user comments
                                 into newly release requirements document.
                                 When complete, she'll call a document 
                                 review meeting to finalize the require-
                                 ments and place a delivery date on BITS
                                 4.00.

        X.  SYSTEM OPERATIONS

            File backup (daily and monthly) procedures for the Production
            Systems are not working properly.

                   Action: 9/14  C. Fletcher and C. Baltrunas will revert
                                 back to a known good process and step
                                 forward until the fault is identified 
                                 and fixed.

                   Update: 9/21  C. Fletcher putting together training 
                                 programs and procedures to insure SUN 
                                 Servers are operated and backed up
                                 properly.  He will re-implement use of
                                 U-backup once a systematic baseline is
                                 achieved. 

                   Action: 9/28  C. Fletcher performed selected partition
                                 dumps last Saturday.  Full operations
                                 training and documentation should be
                                 completed by mid-October.  Malvern to
                                 follow.

                   Action: 9/28  R. Ferguson to reply on FSC preventitive
                                 maintenance policies and procedures for
                                 the SUN systems.

________________________________________________________________

 
Migrations of Public Network nodes will begin the evening of 
Monday, 16 October.  The last two known load bugs are solved.
The first was solved in a September 28th release where nodes
would not come up after loading.  The second bug was not in
Bits at all, but was caused by the absence of several X-25 
patches.  Three of the last four days testing shows 100%
first time load success which satisfied Operations acceptance
criteria.
 
I.   SCHEDULE
 
     Nodes will be loaded after 6PM PDT by Netcon.  Field C.S.
     must deliver code to the NetLoad directory on Saturn five
     (5) days (48 hours for the first week loads) prior to the
     scheduled time of the load.  PI will insure slot code for
     all slots is present and if so, will place the node on the
     load schedule.  If all slot codes are not present, PI will 
     escalate to P. Kiefer and the responsible Tech Manager.  If
     slot code is not present 48 hours after that, I will escalate
     to M. Lonergan.
 
     Because Bits uses the DLoad username to build node load
     circuits, Netcon is the only group or person allowed to load
     nodes from the UNIX systems.  A new release of Bits in December
     or January will fix this so others can load nodes with
     functionality similar to loadii.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
     16 October     2127, 2143, 2146, 2167, 2207, 2211, 2335,
                    2424, 2404, 2407.
     17 October     2011   to   2047
     18 October     2050   to   2125
     19 October     2126   to   2200
     20 October     2221   to   2342
     23 October     2342   to   2537
     24 October     2540   to   2721
     25 October     2722   to   3121
     26 October     3122   to   3306
     27 October     3307   to   3511
     30 October     3512   to   3704
     31 October     3705   to   4100
      1 November    4102   to   4370
      2 November    4371   to   4540
      3 November    4541   to   4660
 
     I will continue to publish schedules as appropriate, giving
     (7) days notice.  Using this schedule, I'll hope to turn off
     at least one PDP 10 by the end of the year.
 
II.  EXCLUSIONS         

     For various reasons, all Public Net nodes cannot be
     immediately converted.  This list documents the exclusions,
     their reasons, and a target date to migrate them.
 
     A.  Payment Systems   DLoad password    Mid-January 1990
 
     B.  Ontyme Systems    DLoad password    Mid-January 1990
 
     C.  Subnets           DLoad password    1Q90
 
     D.  FSC Lab Nodes     DLoad password    Mid-January 1990
 
     E.  Nodes outside continental U.S., MDSI not ready
                                             13 November
 
     F.  NetCon Nodes      Netcon Controls System
                                              13 November
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.  OTHER POINTS

     A.  Field C.S.'s shall copy personal directories from the
         PDP 10 to the UNIX systems.  The Tym and Tym5 
         directories are automatically copied each day.
 
     B.  BBXS 6.02 must be used; earlier versions of BBXS will
         not gen under UNIX NAD.
 
     C.  Anyone that wants an entire node loaded must call
         Netcon because password restriction of the DLoad
         username is mandatory.
 
     D.  If there is ever any question about which system (PDP or
         UNIX) the target node was genned on, the questioner
         should run "CKNODE (node no) (node no)" on the UNIX
         systems.  This program keeps track of nodes running under
         UNIX or under the PDP.  At no time should nodes be
         genned half UNIX, half PDP.  This will lead to confusion
         and possible downtime for customers.  Netcon, after a
         successful load, will update CKNODE once the node is
         converted to UNIX.  Once under UNIX, there is no return.
 
     E.  Definition of a Successful Load.
 
         1.  Node comes up with all slots.
             Slots do not have to be answered, but they have to
             show at least down or shut.  If they show down or
             shut, Netcon will open a ticket for the C.S.  If
             they do not show at all, Netcon will reload from
             the PDP and report a failed cutover attempt to me.
 
         2.  Node comes up with all T201 lines.
             If a T201 line does not come up, Netcon will open a 
             ticket for PI.  If the line that does not come up
             is a deadened node, Netcon will reload from the PDP
             and report a failed cutover attempt to me.
 
     To carry out the above plan, Netcon must probe snap every
     node before loading via UNIX.
 
     After meeting the above criteria, Netcon will update the
     CKNODE program and that node is deemed converted to UNIX.
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     F.  Problem Reporting.
 
         UNIX backup systems contain a mirror make of the
         primary systems (except NIB files).  If a primary
         system  is giving problems, users should log into
         the backup systems to do their work.
 
         Normal escalation procedures apply.  If the problem
         is deemed to be related to node code, ISIS or any
         other Tymnet interface escalate to STS.  If the
         problem is related to the UNIX system or 
         environment, escalate to *** Sunescal.  In an
         emergency, call CRAIG FLETCHER at X6250,  CARL
         BALTRUNAS at X6206, or myself at X6078.  Fremont
         Operations can page us in emergencies, too.
 
     G.  STS is responsible to put all authorized patches on
         the UNIX systems.  HTS is responsible to put all
         diagnostics on the UNIX systems.  NTD is responsible
         to move all Source and Beta Test to the UNIX systems.
 
         Should there be files or programs missing on the UNIX
         systems, contact the same people you would if these
         files were missing on the PDP, the responsible party.

Wayne, thanks for your memo RE Sun code system security. There are many related
issues in your 5 Oct. memo but my view is we take a more focused approach to get things done. My
getting things done. As you summarized at the close of the memo, we should 
narrow our discussions and actions to three key issues: 1 access to our code
machines, 2) the internet and 3) the policy issue whether we ship cyphered or
encrypted or readable source.

SUBJECT>   Unix Migration - Bulletin # 1


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


It is clear now that my message dated 6 October numbered M82652 RE Unix
migration did not contain as much detail as is required. One particular
area regards field C.S. submitting slot code for the nodes on the 
Unix migration schedule. 

When the schedule calls for node xxxxx to be converted on date YY the field
C.S. shall gen the target code on the Unix system. This code is what is
actually running in node at present and should not contain any changes. We ask 
that changes are not introduced at migration time because multiple
changes will make debugging more difficult if cutover of that node fails.

Furthermore, if the conversion fails (for whatever reason) reverting to the
PDP will be more difficult than without the change since the change was
probably only made on the Unix system. So please restrict introduction
of any change as the node is being converted. Once converted, normal code
maintenance may resume.

After the slot is genned the C.S. shall issue an "update" request (documentation
is in a man page title "update"). An update request is the Unix equivelent
of the PDP backup request. This request asks PI to take each slot code for 
the node to be migrated, assemble the code and place it on the load schedule.
Once the C.S. submits an update request and the node is converted to Unix, all
subsequent changes shall occur on the Unix system. An update request will 
deliver cXX, nXX, and and tXX files for that slot.

In the update request the C.S. MUST specify that the update request is for
                                                                Page  2

the Unix migration or a project. Initially, all update requests will be for  
the migration but once we get underway there will be projects that come along
in the normal course of events that require new slot code or node code. PI
needs to review each update request and act on them. PI's actions for migration
update requests and normal project update requests is different, therefore, we
ask that the C.S. specify (if fact, the update script prompts the user for this
information) what the update request is for.

I'm sure more bulletins will be required on these matters so until then...

In the last twenty four hours there was several escalations from field C.S.
that the backup process from the PDP TYM and TYM5 directories is not working.
In both instances it is proved that it is working but the confusion lies in
executing the NODE GET command. NODE GET must be told where to get the file
from. To get a file from the production directory you must tell GET to get
from production (/TYM/X/YYYYY) directory. Using the flexibility of UNIX when
executing GET files can come from your personal directory, NETLOAD, other 
directories or the production directory.

In both instances the right files are in the production directory and the C.S.
executed the GET command correctly. The only thing that wasn't done was
to tell the GET script where to go and get the files. If you don't tell GET to
go to the production directory it won't.

Please read the MAN pages on GET, PUT, GEN, LOOK and UNGET. These instruct how
to properly execute these programs. As always should questions arise use
*** SUNESCAL.

Field C.S. - please check the production directory prior to sumitting UPDATE
requests for the migration. This extra step takes little time and
insures all TYM and TYM5 files are copied to UNIX production. Secondly it
makes sure the most up to date code is loaded into the node on the night of
the migration.

I made a mistake in paragraph 4 Unix Bulletin No.1 Ontyme No. M82XXX. The 
sentence reads "(documentation is in a man page title 'update')". The man page
which outlines the update request in titled "node". I regret any problems this
may have caused you.

Subject: Missing Slot code for Mondays Unix migration loads 
Monday'sUnixLoadSchedule: 

to: ** UNIXDIST
fr: Harry Matthews
re: Monday's Unix Load Schedule

As of 10 AM PDT today the following node slot files were missing for Monday
the 16th load schedule.

2127	slots 1 and 2
2143	slot 3
2146	slot 3
2167	slot 2
2207	slot 1
2211 	slot code is present dated 11 Aug but no update request
2335	same as n 2211
2424	slots 1 and 2
2404 	OK
2407	on original load schedule but removed because this node has a PSC
	slot. This node must wait till February for conversion.


Please deliver slot code as early Monday morning as possible for the missing 
slots so we can get these nodes converted Monday evening. 

NOTE: each slot code delivered must be delivered using the update command, 
we will use an automated program to extract missing slot code
which relies on submissions using update.

Also, nodes scheduled for load Tuesday night should already be
submitted. PI will check Monday and notify you of any missing codes.

      III.  FAULT REPORTS

            3.A.1  System Testing

               a)  Update: 10/12  After several days of 100% success 
                                  rate the backpressure problem has
                                  returned.  Recent implementation of X.25
                                  patches appeared to solve this but
                                  either they do not work or there is 
                                  another problem.  This problem does not
                                  appear to be in BITS but is either in
                                  SUNLINK or XCOM.  Even with this 
                                  problem, load success rates over the 
                                  last five days exceeds 90%.

                   Action: 10/12  R. Ferguson will arrange an FSC lab node
                                  to be available to send multiple loads 
                                  until the hang can be trapped.  Also,
                                  during the nightly load tests, Netcon 
                                  will call C. Baltrunas when a hang 
                                  occurs so he can troubleshoot.

               b)  NTD to add the capability to break out of a BITS load.

                   Update: 10/5  NTD delivered on 9/28 BITS release.  The
                                 method to escape the BITS load is to hit
                                 your UNIX excape character (usually CNTRL
                                 C).

                   Action: 10/5  L. Chavez to have Netcon verify this 
                                 works.

                   Update: 10/12 Item dropped.



               c)  L. Seltzer to get equivalent file capability working.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                   Update: 10/5  Development underway.

               d)  PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 5.33 node code
                   with 6.35 of Consat in tonight or tomorrow night's load
                   schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

            B.  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned   
                that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled 
                twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked 
                to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error 
                is reported.

            3.B.1  Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.

            C.  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                reported a BBXS source bug.

            3.C.1  Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.


                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews trying for QA release by 
                                 10/13

       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

              4.1  PMTS

                   Update: 9/28  PMTS escalation shows a NAD bug that
                                 requires a NAD change.  This bug should
                                 have little impact on PMTS or other
                                 future NAD users.  PMTS changed things 
                                 for a near term work around solution.

                   Update: 10/5  A. Martel and M. Marshall report that 
                                 all PMTS production code has been 
                                 successfully genned and loaded.  PMTS is
                                 confident to migrate to UNIX once BITS is
                                 changed to allow multiple load users on
                                 separate passwords.

                                 T. Srukhosit is encouraged to attend 
                                 these meetings to explain the effects on 
                                 PMTS operations of the NAD bug.  NTD and
                                 PMTS will work closer to explain PMTS and
                                 problems so that NTD can fix.

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  Several 
                                 weeks of delay between problem escalation
                                 and troubleshooting had to do with lack 
                                 of effective communication.

              4.2  ACS 

                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

              4.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews nominated 16 November as the
                                 migration start date for these nodes.

              4.4  A central point of contact for MDISI or Japanese
                   private or Subnetworks must be identified as we 
                   approach migration of these users.

                   Action: 7/24  H. Matthews to identify.


              4.5  FSC 

                   Update: 9/28  Diagnostics have not been moved to UNIX
                                 systems and recompiled because NTS
                                 has not signed the Security Agreement 
                                 yet.

                   Update: 10/12 FSC has requested changes in the was the
                                 diagnostics are copied over to the UNIX 
                                 systems in source directory because the 
                                 engdiag and betadiag directories are not
                                 created.

                   Action: 10/12 C. Baltrunas and R. Ferguson will meet 
                                 and discuss how to set up these 
                                 directories.  Also, R. Ferguson will 
                                 check with Validations on progress of FSC
                                 validations requests.

              4.6  LEMCOMS

                   Update: 9/21  P. Whitehurst to instruct Field people
                                 to test gen and load LEMCOM under UNIX.

                   Action: 10/12 P. Whitehurst to call Field Techs and
                                 schedule testing this week.

        V.  DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S

                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

                   Update: 9/21  Item on hold, retesting will occur prior
                                 to migration.

       VI.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.

      VII.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.



                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

     VIII.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

       IX.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 10/5  P. Whitehurst is assembling user comments
                                 into newly release requirements document.
                                 When complete, she'll call a document 
                                 review meeting to finalize the require-
                                 ments and place a delivery date on BITS
                                 4.00.

        X.  SYSTEM OPERATIONS

            File backup (daily and monthly) procedures for the Production
            Systems are not working properly.

                   Action: 9/28  R. Ferguson to reply on FSC preventitive
                                 maintenance policies and procedures for
                                 the SUN systems.

                   Update: 10/12 Operator training scheduled for 19 
                                 October.  Training to include:  A
                                 backup, system bring up and bring down
                                 and recommended regular monitoring 
                                 practices.

I understand that version 6.02 of BBXS is the only version that should be
used on the UNIX systems  Will 7.01 work?  As it stands now, the slot gens
but not with a patch that we use on the PDP-10's.  The patch in question is:
(RJEPAT)PKGF71.TST.   Phill Sneddon in STS states that this patch, which
references a bunch of patches, should be included in all 7.01 interfaces. 
The node is 6301 slot 5 and has been running 7.01 since March 28,1988.
Please let me know so I can formulate a plan.
 
Thank you,

SUBJECT>   Unix Conversion Exception Report - 10/18 load schedule


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


We didn't have a real good night last night regarding Unix loads. PI
submitted 39 nodes and 6 were completed. Nodes uncompleted are: 2015, 2017
2023, 2027, 2053, 2054, 2055, 2056, 2047, 2013, 2014, 2031, 2033, 2036, 2041
2042, 2032, 2026, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2051, 2062, 2063, 2065, 2067, 2070, 2072,
2070, 2073, 2105, 2106, 2125, 7154, and 4745. Completed nodes are updated in 
CKNODE.

Many of the failed nodes are either 5.33 switchers or 6.35 Consats, in
any event all the failed nodes are returned to service running PDP codes.

Ten failed nodes had too many passthroughs to reload, one node was already
down as a result of the earthquake, time did not allow nine nodes to be
reloaded, six succeeded, and there were 13 Unix related failures. 
Of the 33 failures, 60% can be attributed to the earthquake, therefore, 
we have to do more nodes tonight to catch up for the low amount the last
two nights. The 13 Unix related failures are a surprise. By Unix
related I define as relating to the new enviroment (Sun, Unix OS, file naming
conventions, new path mechanisms, and Bits). Eight of the thirteen
failed when Bits reported zero records received, two other problems were
appearently caused because Netcon could not access the servers, 
one node loaded but didn't come up, and Bits reported load failures with
new error messages.

Zero records recieved and server access failures appear to be procedural
problems since we haven't seen this report before and the servers were
operational throughout the night. Regardless of appearences we'll investigate
                                                                Page  2

these failures further. Nodes that failed to come after Bits loads was reported
fixed in a 9/28 release of Bits and our testing found this true. We'll
look at this again though, as well as the new error messages. 

To summarize, we'll investigate the failures and report back to you on our
findings and continue on schedule. Tonight we'll re-try last night
failures as well as load tonights scheduled node list.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Due to the number of CS's escalating problems for missing patch files I
announce a short delay for Isis slot and node migrations.  Appearently, STS
patches and NTD sources are available on Unix but the source patches are not.
We are taking steps right now to fix this by putting source patch files for
all products on the Unix systems via tape and electronic distribution methods. 

This delay only effects customer Isis slots, migration of 5.33 switcher code
will continue. Right now there is approximately 30 nodes in the network running
from Unix, 14 of these are customer nodes. Due to the absence of source patch
files problems may be experienced with these and Netcon is prepared to revert
back to the PDP as necessary.

I will contact everyone when slot code sysgens can resume. Hopefully,
this will be tommarrow and in the meantime I'll plan how to restart the 
migration in full.

I wanted to drop you this short note to let you know that Netcon successfully
converted 14 nodes to Unix last night (without failures) running 5.33 switcher 
code. Although the migration of customer ISIS nodes is delayed because of
the absence of source patch files, migration of switcher code continues since
we know all the files are present for this code.

We have looked very closely at the 33 failed conversion attempts on Wednesday
night and I have determined most of these to be procedural problems, not 
technical problems. Steps are implemented to solve these so I am confident that
the migration will resume in full next week.

The missing source patch files are on the Unix systems now. We are in 
the process of verifying file integrity, insuring we have all the necessary
files and we'll then distribute to the appropriate directory once we complete  
the task. Furthermore, steps are underway to insure that the Unix systems are 
updated using the same methods as exist today with the PDP's.

node 3404 has an ati in slot 1 with a host number 16454.
i understand that there is a problem with loading accounting host #'s
greater than 16000.  therefore this node should not be included in
the migration process till we can get another host number.

help...
PLEASE BE INFORMED. UPON MY TRYING TO GEN SLOT FILES ON UNIX ON FRIDAY OCT 20
I HAD A FEW PROBLEMS AND WAS UNABLE TO GEN ONE AND A PROBLEM WITH ANOTHER.
THERE WERE NO FILES WHATSOEVER FOR NODE3400. I COULD NOT DO A NODE GET TO
BRING THE SLOT 1 FILES INTO MY PERSONAL DIRECTORY. THERE FORE THIS CODE IS
NOT GENNED FOR UNIX. IT IS SCHEDULED TO BE RELOADED ON FRIDAY OCTOBER 27TH.

2ND PROB.     NODE 3216 DID NOT SEEM TO COPY THE T01 AND C01 FILES BACK INTO
THE NETLOAD DIRECTORY. THE ONLY ONE WHEICH WAS PLACED ON THE PUT COMMAND
WAS THE N01 FILE. UNFORTUNATELY I ALREADY HAD DELETED THEM FROM MY DIRECTORY.
SO NOW IT SEEMS THEY DO NOT EXIST. LET ME KNOW IF I CAN GET THEM COPIED OVER
OR WHAT THE AVENUE IS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN......WHEN EVERYTHING IS OK'D
I WILL SEND MY BACKUP REQUEST FOR NODE 3216.

THANKS

      III.  MIGRATION ISSUES

            3.1  L. Seltzer to get equivalent file capability working.

                   Update: 9/14  P. Whitehurst has assigned this to 
                                 her staff, work will not start until
                                 load bugs are solved.

                   Update: 10/5  Development underway.

            3.2  PI and C. Baltrunas will attempt to get 5.33 node code
                 with 6.35 of Consat in tonight or tomorrow night's load
                 schedule.

                   Update: 9/14  All 5.33 and 6.35 code testing is halted
                                 until notification from NTD that bugs are
                                 worked out.

                   Update: 10/19 5.33 switcher code is being deployed 
                                 during the migration.  6.35 Consat
                                 deployments are still delayed.

            3.3  SNA, PBH and ACOM System Failures - "operand out of
                 range".  Caused by source code checksum mismatch after
                 PDP to UNIX file transfer.  Furthermore, it is learned   
                 that UNIX NAD will not allow patches to be assembled 
                 twice, whereas PDP 10 NAD would.  When UNIX NAD is asked 
                 to assemble patches twice an operand out of range error 
                 is reported.

                   Action: 7/11  Source  code recopied, code regenned,
                                 fault resolved.

                   Action: 7/11  B. Soley (NTD) will write a UNIX program
                                 that compares PDP and UNIX directories
                                 after the PDP directory is copied to UNIX
                                 to prevent future problems of this
                                 nature.

                   Update: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported that B. Soley's  
                                 program will check that files are
                                 transferred intact.  What also is needed 
                                 is a program to periodically start itself
                                 and check source code integrity against
                                 periodic for transfer corruptions.

                   Action: 7/28  P. Whitehurst reported she can assign
                                 this task to one of her developers
                                 between major assignments, since it is
                                 not a large task.



            3.4  Field escalated BBXS Sysgen failures.  P. Whitehurst
                 reported a BBXS source bug.

                   Update: 9/14  NTD fixed BBXS code in a new release
                                 number 6.02.  To gen BBXS on the UNIX
                                 systems this version must be used.

                   Update: 9/21  This release should be transmitted to the
                                 Production Systems.

                   Action: 9/21  NTD Program Management to transmit 6.02 
                                 to Production Systems after successful 
                                 QA testing.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews trying for QA release by 
                                 10/13

                   Update: 10/19 Code released 10/18, Technical Services
                                 will install by 10/20.  Item dropped.

            3.5  NETCON BOOT SCRIPT

                 When nodes do not have the WDT enabled Netcon uses a 
                 custom designed Cmd file in PDP NAD to force the node
                 into boot.  This function is not available in UNIX
                 NAD, therefore, C. Baltrunas will develop a script
                 that provides Netcon with equivalent capabilities.


       IV.  INTER-COMPANY ISSUES

              4.1  PMTS

                   Update: 9/28  PMTS escalation shows a NAD bug that
                                 requires a NAD change.  This bug should
                                 have little impact on PMTS or other
                                 future NAD users.  PMTS changed things 
                                 for a near term work around solution.

                   Update: 10/5  A. Martel and M. Marshall report that 
                                 all PMTS production code has been 
                                 successfully genned and tested.  PMTS is
                                 confident to migrate to UNIX once BITS is
                                 changed to allow multiple load users on
                                 separate passwords.

                                 T. Srukhosit is encouraged to attend 
                                 these meetings to explain the effects on 
                                 PMTS operations of the NAD bug.  NTD and
                                 PMTS will work closer to explain PMTS and
                                 problems so that NTD can fix.

                   Update: 10/12 NTD has all necessary information to 
                                 analyze PMTS NAD escalation.  Several 
                                 weeks of delay between problem escalation
                                 and troubleshooting had to do with lack 
                                 of effective communication.




              4.2  ACS 


                   Update: 10/12 ACS is re-thinking their strategy of
                                 discontinuing Outdial code as reported in
                                 last meeting.  ACS migration of OnTyme 
                                 code is rescheduled for 1 February.  ACS
                                 BBXS migration will be scheduled night 
                                 after a short test period of the new
                                 release 6.02, once it is released.

              4.3  J. Oliveto and P. Mellet to act as central points of
                   contact for all nodes located outside the continental
                   United States and are under control of the Public
                   Network Supervisors.

                   Update: 10/12 H. Matthews nominated 16 November as the
                                 migration start date for these nodes.

                   Update: 10/19 Pacific Region has responded, no response
                                 from Europe yet.

              4.4  FSC 

                   Update: 9/28  Diagnostics have not been moved to UNIX
                                 systems and recompiled because NTS
                                 has not signed the Security Agreement 
                                 yet.

                   Update: 10/12 FSC has requested changes in the was the

        V.  DAILY UPDATES OF PDP CHANGES TO FREMONT SUN'S

                   Update: 8/25  L. Reed will develop a test plan to 
                                 insure that changes to the Tym and Tym5
                                 directories are being backed up to the
                                 UNIX systems.

                   Update: 8/31  L. Reed has tested and reports the back 
                                 up process is working effectively.

                   Update: 10/12 Process is working effectively, item 
                                 dropped.



       VI.  UNIX SECURITY

                   Update: 10/5  H. Matthews working with W. Bartlett,
                                 C. Baltrunas and B. Soley to 
                                 prioritize security issues for Tymnet
                                 code systems.  The three main issues 
                                 are C2 security features in SUNOS 
                                 4.0.3, the internet, and cyphered 
                                 source.

      VII.  Software release engineering procedures are being specified by
            Thom Kelley.  Thom's action item is to document and specify 
            the processes and interfaces by which software is moved from
            NTD to Operations to End Users.  FYI - Future code
            distribution via UNIX systems will be triggered from a OES
            order.

                   Update: 9/14  H. Matthews and T. Kelley developing
                                 the requirements statement.

                   Update: 9/28  Procedures are not being drafted because
                                 the release engineering process for C
                                 code is very complex.  A white paper 
                                 identifying the issues is put forward
                                 for Management review and action.

     VIII.  Public net mass file change requests.

            Presently underway on the PDP-10 is a project to mass update
            consats and switcher code and deploy throughout the public
            net.  A program is required to carry out mass TYM and CMD file
            changes on the UNIX Systems.  J. Smith and C. Baltrunas are
            assigned this task and the program shall be ready when the
            UNIX migration starts.

                   Update: 10/19 C. Baltrunas will work with P. Michel to
                                 specify what are the exact requirements 
                                 so that Carl can write a script to auto-
                                 matically change Tym and Cmd files.

       IX.  It is noted that there are some features of Loadii that are
            not present in BITS.  H. Matthews will arrange a meeting
            to discuss these issues.  This is a critical issue for 
            Subnets.

                   Update: 10/5  P. Whitehurst is assembling user comments
                                 into newly release requirements document.
                                 When complete, she'll call a document 
                                 review meeting to finalize the require-
                                 ments and place a delivery date on BITS
                                 4.00.

                   Update: 10/19 Requirements document is into the offices
                                 of J. Snavely and D. Murtaugh for formal
                                 acceptance.



        X.  SYSTEM OPERATIONS

            File backup (daily and monthly) procedures for the Production
            Systems are not working properly.

                   Action: 9/28  R. Ferguson to reply on FSC preventitive
                                 maintenance policies and procedures for
                                 the SUN systems.

                   Update: 10/19 Operator training is complete, another
                                 class is scheduled for 10/26.  Fremont 
                                 Operations is nearly ready to take on all
                                 aspects of SUN operations.  Furthermore, 
                                 outlines and initial test of a disaster 
                                 recovery plan is being developed.

Subject: yr msg. RE gen problems. 

Mike,

problem 1, if no files on 3400 slot one exist then let me ask a few questions
to try and determine why. 

a. name the date the slot was created
b. name the last time the slot was changed
c. when was the last PDP backup request submitted for this node.

If my suspicions are correct it was installed after early July '89 and has
not been changed since. If so, then I can see how the code wasn't moverd
to the Unix systems. Either way, I need asnwers to these questions.

What you should do to insure all your code is on the Unix systems ( I might
add that missing t and c files are the exception, most are there ) is to
perform a PDP 10 backup request. This moves the code from wherever it is to
the TYM and TYM5 directories on the PDP. When this happens it gets moved
to the unix production directories, too.

2nd problem: If you can send us a hardcopy we may be able to help
further on this, if not I am unsure what we can do for you. 



On either of the two probelms, the netcopy program will copy files from
the PDP to Unix, you can always use this to recover.

What has to happen now is:

1. PI (L.Reed) should regen all converted and pending conversion nodes
   that use 5.22 node code. Nodes already converted will not be reloaded. 
   The newly genned code should replace the old code in the production
   directory.

2. Netcon should reload the newly genned code when circumstances demand.

3. C.S.'s should regen their codes if they have any slots which were missing
   any of the above files. After regen submit an UPDATE request marked 
   "REGEN" and we'll place these on the load schedule.

Other information:

A. Sixty four nodes are converted to Unix and more occur each day. Before
   troubleshooting a node use CKNODE to determine where the production code
   is.

B. Customer ISIS node conversions will resume tonight. 5.33 switcher code
   code conversions continue.

Harry,

I glad you were able to correct the loading problem and resume the
SUN migration so quickly.

Reference your latest OnTyme, it is not clear to me at what point we
are resuming.  Are we resuming with the first or second week of your
old schedule?  What nodes are due?  Maybe its just me whos confused,
but would you send out a new schedule so I can advice my group.

Thanks,

Here is a handy tip to check which nodes are converted to Unix. Log into the
Unix systems and type:

			cknode -a | grep sun

This command gives you all nodes converted to Unix.

			cknode -a | grep mm/dd

This command gives you all nodes converted to Unix on a specific date. A
good use for the date arguement is to find out which nodes were converted
last night. Use this when you come in, first thing in the AM. You should be able
to tell from the node number if your customer was converted last night because
Netcon updates cknode right after a successful Unix cutover.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


It appears the original Unix migration schedule published 6 October is too
agressive. We have had great difficulties keeping up with it. For
example, by today we should have well over 200 nodes converted, in fact we
have 90. According to the original schedule we should be converting nodes in
the 2722 - 3121 range tonight. In an effort to maintain control of this and
get the migration running smoothly we'll not convert customer ISIS nodes
above node number 3121 (switchers will continue).

C.S's should continue to submit update requests, if you have not already done 
so, for ISIS nodes numbered below 3121. We'll catch up on the nodes numbered  
below 3121 prior to moving the migration forward past this number.

Carl, Joe,
  I heard this afternoon that Ken Holcomb has committed Don (i.e. Ron's
group) to support for NTD's and operation's Suns.  I don't know how firm
that is, but that seems to be NTD's plans for support, at least for now.

Subject: Fremont SUNs, ASYNC connection 

Krish,

  After you left, I arranged with FSCO to check the slot code (Joe Smith)
and the TYMCOM:TOM host and we re-genned the slot to set the speed for the
TOM port.  We apparently weren't having any luck, so I had FSCO (Ali)
run some diags on the ASYNCH board and again we found no reason for our
problems.  After Ali finished, I loaded the new code and was able to get
to TOM which reported all the other ports down (Ok since they were all
disconnected at that time).  I then began connecting them one at a time
after re-cableing them ports 1-6 with port 0 connected to TOM.  The ports
on DELTA came up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  I then went and got a tape from BLDG F with another editor (not vi) so
I could modify the conf/"host" files to set mcp0/mcp1 correctly and also
re-configured all the kernals and ttytab files for ttyhf...

  So!  They are all up NOW!

................I will NOT be in until LATE LATE LATE today...................

I stayed at the dta center pretty late, and if you check the timestamp on this
message you can tell what time I went to sleep from working on this.  I think
getting it done was more important than my being in in the morning...

See you all around 1:00 pm.   Call me at home (408) 945 - 4314  if you need
to see me or talk to me before 1 o'clock.


PS.  I hung DELTA accidentally from home, so you may want to reboot it, or ask
      Rick Daniels to hit <break> and "b" to save a trip to the data center
     just to do that.

The next general Sun Systems Migration meeting will be held on Tuesday
May 9 at 10 am in C3-600. A number of issues including YP, Tymfile
directory structures, NFS mounts, and disk partitions have been resolved
in various task force meetings, and in meetings with Sun. A draft report
is being prepared to summarize these findings. A migration schedule has
also been prepared. These items will be discussed.
 
Please plan to attend.

Subject: Fremont SUNs 

Vida,
  I would like to talk to you about the fremont suns and the validations
efforts required by your department.

  There are two issues at the moment:

  How much your group should do...

  Restricting access to the hosts...


  In terms of restricting access... I am in favor of adding a new "group" of
hosts which will include the 6 x.25 hosts, the async tymcom for these hosts
(at the moment one, possibly 6 later on), the two hosts in malvern (x.25) and
probably a tymcom to access these also.

  The idea is to group them like the PDP-10s were grouped, so if the host
numbers changed, more were added, etc... we wouldn't have to update all the
usernames that had access.

  The major work (after setting up the group) is adding all the users that
require access to the machines, one by one...  (You have the list from Phil
Kiefer... plus we have PI, NETCON, VALIDATIONS, etc.)

  COnsidering the normal workload, this may all be a wash.. "all in a days work"
   but it may also be a headache.  Let me know what you think, and when we can
get together to talk about it.


/Carl

Carl,

Thanks very much for your ontyme. 

I agree it is time to talk about the Suns in Fremont and what our
Department will be doing as far as validations to/in the suns are
concerned.

I have rceived 2 ontymes from Phil Kiefer and I am arranging for
Cynthia to begin training on validating usernames in the Suns
with Keith Roan. 


I need to speak with Don Murtaugh on a copuple of things concerning
proceedure before we meet. 

I will call you in the next couple of days to set up a meeting time.

Thanks for your memo

Subject: Username MAIL barred from the new Sun servers. 

User name MAIL needs to be allowed to login to hosts 9928, 9929, 4644, 5060,
8875, 9752, and 10654.  It would be best if these 7 host numbers were added
to the group that includes all the PDP-10 systems, since these Sun servers are
replacing the PDP-10 systems.  Also, add nodes 3713, 4344, 3212, and 2237 to
the same class as the PDP-10 bases.  If you have any questions, ask Carl.

I am trying to use the name MAIL to deliver uucp mail to the Unix systems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The purpose of this memo is to announce the formal handing over of
the Tymnet Suns Code Management Project from Planning Tools Development
(Network Planning) to Network Services organization.
 
Since November 1988, Network Planning has been responsible for
initiating this project and bringing it to an "Operating" State.
Some of the tasks that have been completed include:
 
	o Sizing of the number and location of machines.
	o Tymnet network connection issues.
	o Sun System Networking problems.
	o Tymfile directory structures.
	o Network code directory structures.
	o Code generation tools directory structures.
	o Distribution of disks among the Fremont and Malvern sites.
	o Distribution of home directories on the Sun machines.
	o Checking consistency with current Tymfile backup procedures.
	o System Administration tasks and Organizational Structure.
	o Initial install and bring up of the Sun machines.
	o X.25 install and bring up.
	o Code gen testing and node loading (alpha test).
 
Krish Narayan has been involved in this project since November 1988,
as the Project Leader of this project. We are happy to report the
                                                                Page  2

following status on this project:
 
	o Preliminary Version of "Procedures and Guidelines" written,
	  which includes several recommendations for Operating the
	  Suns.
	o Install of SunOS 4.0.1 completed successfully.
	o Install of YP completed and successful.
	o Tymfile and Network code directory structures in place.
	o X.25 installed and tested out successfully, both in the Sun
	  side and Engine side, with full V.35 connectivity.
	o Nad and bits tested out and verified for workability.
	o Network code brought over from System 33 and installed into
	  the correct structure on the Suns by Network Services.
	o PIRs issued for new versions of Nad, Bits, cpp etc.  for the
	  Sun 4 processor.
 
This project is now in "Operation" and with no major open issues.
This completes Network Planning's role in the migration process for
code generation and associated tools. As of June 1, Network Resources
is supporting this project.  Krish will continue to be available
for consultation to help resolve any unexpected problems, making
sure that the transition is smooth.
 
I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank all of you for the
excellent support you have provided to Krish during this project to make
it a reality. This project has always been a major challenge and we can all
take pride in what we have accomplished.
 
Regards,
 
Jay Parekh.

     I must countermand Jan Krivanec's 1/27/89 memo.  I am sorry about
     the confusion.

     I have been working for some time to upgrade the security features
     of SETOP.  It is finally now being implemented.  Although we have
     tried to make the upgrade as transparent as possible, part of that
     plan is to have all of Network Systems under Network Systems
     control.  Therefore, TYMNET Validations will manage SETOP functions
     for Network Systems.  You all still have your own manager functions,
     as before, but now with more flexibility.  The only added control is
     at the time a new user name is added.  That function will go through
     an audit by TYMNET Validations to insure proper information is in
     the database (of course, we are working the current "cutover
     problem" of getting all existing names and owners in the database).

Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behalf" of another user.

Carl, Joe,
  I heard this afternoon that Ken Holcomb has committed Don (i.e. Ron's
group) to support for NTD's and operation's Suns.  I don't know how firm
that is, but that seems to be NTD's plans for support, at least for now.

Subject: Fremont SUNs, ASYNC connection 

Krish,

  After you left, I arranged with FSCO to check the slot code (Joe Smith)
and the TYMCOM:TOM host and we re-genned the slot to set the speed for the
TOM port.  We apparently weren't having any luck, so I had FSCO (Ali)
run some diags on the ASYNCH board and again we found no reason for our
problems.  After Ali finished, I loaded the new code and was able to get
to TOM which reported all the other ports down (Ok since they were all
disconnected at that time).  I then began connecting them one at a time
after re-cableing them ports 1-6 with port 0 connected to TOM.  The ports
on DELTA came up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  I then went and got a tape from BLDG F with another editor (not vi) so
I could modify the conf/"host" files to set mcp0/mcp1 correctly and also
re-configured all the kernals and ttytab files for ttyhf...

  So!  They are all up NOW!

................I will NOT be in until LATE LATE LATE today...................

I stayed at the dta center pretty late, and if you check the timestamp on this
message you can tell what time I went to sleep from working on this.  I think
getting it done was more important than my being in in the morning...

See you all around 1:00 pm.   Call me at home (408) 945 - 4314  if you need
to see me or talk to me before 1 o'clock.


PS.  I hung DELTA accidentally from home, so you may want to reboot it, or ask
      Rick Daniels to hit <break> and "b" to save a trip to the data center
     just to do that.

The next general Sun Systems Migration meeting will be held on Tuesday
May 9 at 10 am in C3-600. A number of issues including YP, Tymfile
directory structures, NFS mounts, and disk partitions have been resolved
in various task force meetings, and in meetings with Sun. A draft report
is being prepared to summarize these findings. A migration schedule has
also been prepared. These items will be discussed.
 
Please plan to attend.

Subject: Fremont SUNs 

Vida,
  I would like to talk to you about the fremont suns and the validations
efforts required by your department.

  There are two issues at the moment:

  How much your group should do...

  Restricting access to the hosts...


  In terms of restricting access... I am in favor of adding a new "group" of
hosts which will include the 6 x.25 hosts, the async tymcom for these hosts
(at the moment one, possibly 6 later on), the two hosts in malvern (x.25) and
probably a tymcom to access these also.

  The idea is to group them like the PDP-10s were grouped, so if the host
numbers changed, more were added, etc... we wouldn't have to update all the
usernames that had access.

  The major work (after setting up the group) is adding all the users that
require access to the machines, one by one...  (You have the list from Phil
Kiefer... plus we have PI, NETCON, VALIDATIONS, etc.)

  COnsidering the normal workload, this may all be a wash.. "all in a days work"
   but it may also be a headache.  Let me know what you think, and when we can
get together to talk about it.


/Carl

Thanks very much for your ontyme. 

I agree it is time to talk about the Suns in Fremont and what our
Department will be doing as far as validations to/in the suns are
concerned.

I have rceived 2 ontymes from Phil Kiefer and I am arranging for
Cynthia to begin training on validating usernames in the Suns
with Keith Roan. 


I need to speak with Don Murtaugh on a copuple of things concerning

I will call you in the next couple of days to set up a meeting time.

Thanks for your memo

User name MAIL needs to be allowed to login to hosts 9928, 9929, 4644, 5060,

to the group that includes all the PDP-10 systems, since these Sun servers are
replacing the PDP-10 systems.  Also, add nodes 3713, 4344, 3212, and 2237 to
the same class as the PDP-10 bases.  If you have any questions, ask Carl.

I am trying to use the name MAIL to deliver uucp mail to the Unix systems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The purpose of this memo is to announce the formal handing over of
the Tymnet Suns Code Management Project from Planning Tools Development
(Network Planning) to Network Services organization.
 
Since November 1988, Network Planning has been responsible for
initiating this project and bringing it to an "Operating" State.
Some of the tasks that have been completed include:
 
	o Sizing of the number and location of machines.
	o Tymnet network connection issues.
	o Sun System Networking problems.
	o Tymfile directory structures.
	o Network code directory structures.
	o Code generation tools directory structures.
	o Distribution of disks among the Fremont and Malvern sites.
	o Distribution of home directories on the Sun machines.
	o Checking consistency with current Tymfile backup procedures.
	o System Administration tasks and Organizational Structure.
	o Initial install and bring up of the Sun machines.
	o X.25 install and bring up.
	o Code gen testing and node loading (alpha test).
 
Krish Narayan has been involved in this project since November 1988,
as the Project Leader of this project. We are happy to report the
                                                                Page  2

following status on this project:
 
	o Preliminary Version of "Procedures and Guidelines" written,
	  which includes several recommendations for Operating the
	  Suns.
	o Install of SunOS 4.0.1 completed successfully.
	o Install of YP completed and successful.
	o Tymfile and Network code directory structures in place.
	o X.25 installed and tested out successfully, both in the Sun
	  side and Engine side, with full V.35 connectivity.
	o Nad and bits tested out and verified for workability.
	o Network code brought over from System 33 and installed into
	  the correct structure on the Suns by Network Services.
	o PIRs issued for new versions of Nad, Bits, cpp etc.  for the
	  Sun 4 processor.
 
This project is now in "Operation" and with no major open issues.
This completes Network Planning's role in the migration process for
code generation and associated tools. As of June 1, Network Resources
is supporting this project.  Krish will continue to be available
for consultation to help resolve any unexpected problems, making
sure that the transition is smooth.
 
I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank all of you for the
excellent support you have provided to Krish during this project to make
it a reality. This project has always been a major challenge and we can all
take pride in what we have accomplished.
 
Regards,
 
Jay Parekh.

=======================================================================

As of Tuesday morning, 3:00am GEMINI has been upgraded to 4.0.3 with all
the appropriate software (MCP & Sunlink x.25) installed.

I was able to build a circuit via /usr/sunlink/x25/pad to Tymnet and back
into host 9929 for the first time in 4 days.  Nad and bits also work and
to verify their operation, I re-genned i2is and node code for node 3212.
[i2is bombed, one of the 6/6 students modified the cmd file, incorrectly]!

Node code worked fine.  bits was also able to load an x25 slot for the
atlas sun system.

=======================================================================

Mercury, is currently "down".  Nothing is wrong with it, except that I have
nearly (but only "nearly") finished installing SunOs 4.0.3.  I must leave
soon so that I may get some sleep, so the remander of the work on Mercury
will have to wait until Tuesday afternoon.  What remains to be done is the
MCP and X25 sunlink installation and the final customizations to the kernel
file.  It is really taking 4-6 hours per cpu to do the upgrade, but only
because we have to re-install 4.0 to insure that we have all the requisite
software.

=======================================================================

*** If the system crashes as the CS's attempt to use Gemini, please call ***
*** me at home immediately, otherwise I will be at home attempting to    ***
*** get some sleep until noon.  This has been a 20 hour workday today!!! ***
*** Jack, please edit this info an retransmit it to the appropriate few  ***

Apparently, the installation of SunOs 4.0.3 was NOT completed correctly on
GEMINI and MERCURY yesterday.

The kernel gen appeared complete.  However, since some ancilliary files were
not complete, I have initiated the re-installation of the SunOs 4.0.3 upgrade
again, last night and this morning.

As of this writing the servers are in the following states:

  delta      gemini     saturn     mercury   atlas      titan
  4.0 full   4.0 full   4.0 tape1  4.0 full  4.0 full   4.0 full
  4.0.1 ok   4.0.1 ok   4.0.1 ok   4.0.1 ok  4.0.1 ok   4.0.1 ok
             4.0.3 ok              4.0.3 #1  4.0.3 ok   4.0.3 #2

to be completed this morning, another ontyme is forthcoming...

  4.0.3                 4.0.3      4.0.3 #2             4.0.3 ok
  MCP        MCP        MCP        MCP        MCP       MCP
  x25        x25        x25        x25        x25       x25

more later...  I need to get some breakfast and get back to this
marathon 4.0.3 installation so we can ge the user on the systems.

--------------

One problem, please call Phil K and ask for his preferences, but we
overlooked a small inconvenience with the unix usernames.  There is
a length restriction of 8 characters in much of the software and the
Unix utilities.  More than 8 is acceptable to some programs, eg. the
login and csh shells, but it is *DOCUMENTED* that the username field
in the password file /etc/passwd contains a maximum of 8 characters.

Since we are using first-initial last-name, unless you tell me otherwise
I will truncate the names for the field at 8 characters.

For operations, I'm using last name, first initial and will have to get
with Rick Daniels today to rename the users that have their names truncated.

-------------------------

I'll be at the data center x587 after 8am.

The following is the schedule of when the FULL DUMP and
INCREMENTAL tapes must be ready for all hosts:

23 Jun - SETS 1 AND 2 WITH INCREMENTAL TAPES

30 Jun - SETS 3 AND 4 WITH INCREMENTAL TAPES

 7 Jul - SET 5 WITH INCREMENTAL TAPES
 7 Jul - SET 6 (FULL DUMP TAPES ONLY)

14 Jul - SETS 7 AND 8 (FULL DUMP TAPES ONLY)

21 Jul - SETS 9 AND 10 (FULL DUMP TAPES ONLY)

UBACKUP, the software that will be used to take the DUMPS and
INCREMENTALS, is being installed by Dave HOPKINS on some of the
Servers.  As soon as it is installed and we learn how to use it,
DUMPS and INCREMENTALS will be performed on these hosts.

The Center must be ready for this by 23 Jun. 
                                                                Page  2


Thanks for your efforts in the work that has been done and what
must be done to accomplish the above.

Jack,

  All 6 servers are apparently up, with x.25 running fine.  PAD has been
configured to allow x.25 outgoing circuits to act a little nicer.

  We still need the new NAD.

  The Dallas tapes won't arrive till Tuesday morning.

  I expect to have my program finished by then.

  I have a 1:00 meeting with Allyn Morris & friends,
   and the 3:00 MDUAC meeting.

  Most users have been validated, both network and on the suns.


Please check your user id on the network.

operations and acs and psc are all that is left out.
I will be working on that tuesday, while my conversion program is
running.   (I will be working on moving their files, not validation).

Keith and I still need to get together on Tuesday to meet that deadline
(although I haven't had mch time to work on any details of the SA
responsibilities, as yet.)

I've already put in 5 hours today, see you around 10:00 am.

Call me at home if you need me sooner!  408-945-4314.

Subject: re: sun status 


/home directories have been re-configured to allow for a much cleaner
implementation and to stadardize all the partition mount tables (/etc/fstab)
for all servers.  atlas is the only exception, because it is the mail server.

All client workstations are also a little different, but are identical for
each server they occupy space on.

more work has been accomplished on my cmd-file conversion program, but it is
not yet complete... not to worry, we can still have the testing personnell
sharpen their unix editing skills by having them modify their individual cmd,
c00 and c0? files.  they do need the practice!

I will work with fremont ops (morning) and keith (midday-afternoon) to move
the tym files to their correct directories and to work out SA responsibilities.

(I will be at the fremont data center, 10ish).


Meeting with allyn & diana went well.  We need to think about the future which
includes turbo code, but the current ntd structure should map easily into our
source-code directories  and  the staging process for ntd to deliver code to
our staging area on "a" sun server should go reasonably ok.


Joe and I should be able to produce some set-gid scripts this week for the
field to use for the testing.  I'd like all node loads from the suns to be
made out of the ~piload and ~netload  (and ~pscload and ~acsload) directories
for the test.  This way, the file permissions for various groups will work
until we have that problem solved.


I talked to the people in the MDCUAC meeting about a network link between
the machines in NTD, a la x.25, for limited distribution and we felt that
a position paper should be researched showing the pro's and con's of such
a connection in terms of system security.  Then we should make a decision
about using this link for NTD distributions to our staging area, and to
send the TYM and CMD files to Malvern, via a similar link.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


DALLAS will be sending the Center tapes of files stored from
the directory of TYMNET:54 and TYM5:25 to be restored on the
SUN Systems.

Upon receipt of these tapes, Operators are requested to do the
following:

     a.  On GEMINI and SATURN, if you are not at the logon
prompt, enter a control C (^C).  This should put you at the
prompt.

     b.  Mount the tape from System 54 on GEMINI's tape drive
WITHOUT the write ring and load the tape.

     c.  At the prompt, type in 'piload' (lower case please), 
with a carriage return.

     d.  At the next prompt, type in:

         cd /pdp (CR)          (You are now connected to this
                                                                Page  2

                                directory)

     e.  At the next prompt (/pdp piload@gemini%), type in:

         tar -xv               (Files should now be restoring
                                to this directory)

     As each file is restored, it will print out on the screen.
     This may take some time to complete.

     f.  When tape is finished, you should be back at the prompt
(/pdp/piload@gemini%).

     g.  At this prompt, type in:

         cd tymnet (CR)

         ls | /usr/tym/moveit | csh -x (CR)

     h.  At the next prompt, type in:

         logout

     i.  Dismount the tape and place it on the documentation table.

The tape from System 25 is mounted on SATURN's tape drive and the
same procedures are used substituting 'tym5' for 'tymnet' and
'tym5' for 'tym' where appearing.

Thank you,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Hi Phillipe,

We at International have recently become aware of 
the following issue in regard to the upcoming 
Sun migration : 

Currently, the "CMD" files for some X.25  interfaces supported
by the field make references to (INTLTECH)DNIC.NOD .
As I understand it, if these files are ported to the Sun's,
they will  not gen correctly - because NAD cannot 
translate "INTLTECH" to the correct path.

We are considering the possibility of putting this file
into XCOMPAT on the Suns. Pending that, the folks that will be 
performing the "betatest" gens may need to be aware of this.


Regards,


Rajan Mani / INSS

The file (MAIL:74)ROUTER.NET has the list of known hosts and domains.
It says that mail to antares, hobbes, etc, all get sent to tymix.
Tymix knows how to get to all hosts on the ethernets, and has a special
case for doctor and tardis.  (I sent you mail saying that carl@doctor works,
as long as "doctor" is in lowercase.)  Tymix does not know anything about
gemini yet.

Jack,

  In terms of sun availability:  all systems are up.

  FSCO has cables for consat on hand, waiting for installation.
  - will arrange for installation

  Nodes were genned without major incident yesterday evening.
  - NETCON given proper instruction for loading with bits
  - only concern was for loading solo engines (netcon had problems
    running bits in interactive mode to load a solo switcher)
  - check with Phillipe for status of loads by NETCON.

  Meeting arranged with Rick Daniels for operator training and any
  additional procedures required for daily operation of the systems.
  Document forthcoming.

My schedule:
  Will be stopping by data center first today, expect to be back to
  first street by noon.

re: status

all sun servers up.  mercury had RPC portmapper problems (software). rebooted.
all sun servers up and functional.

hardware installed for consat in node 2237.  installed (except for cross-over
cables, which were delivered as the wrong kind).  needed are 16 male-to-female
crossover cables to complete the installation.

new slots genned on the sun systems, appeared ok.
new slots did NOT load correctly using  the bits engine-load "el" command.
    nib (I2IS) and n00 (node code) were ok
    neither the n01 (ACOM tymcom) nor n02 (consat) came up.

reloaded slots n01 and n02 from newly modified (to match the suns) PDP-10
code and all was well.

reloaded slots n01 and n02 from sun and this time, the tymcom appeared ok,
but the consat did not come up.

reloaded n02 consat code from PDP-10 to test the hookup to one of the suns
using a "borrowed" male-to-female crossover cable.

connection stable - consat is up [from the PDP-10]  we need to address this!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PSC production directories are moved to the suns: delta & gemini.

ACS directories are located in dallas, system 34 - will require shipping
and loading later this week.
  - I'm sending a batch request for operations to handle this (this is
    a test... we will see if they can follow directions) no slur intended
    (unix is kinda cryptic at times)

There are still some validations issues, which cynthia is aware of that I
need to address (more time fixing another script to make here job easier).
I expect to work on that wednesday.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

phillippe reports to me, via mail, that his loads were successful.

(note: my unsuccessful loads may NOT be a bits problems, it bears further
       investigation before we point fingers at nad, bits, or the tym/cmd
       files.  I will work with Phillippe on this!)

Validation scripts completed and debugged.

node script completed... should work under all known problem conditions.
please ask phillipe to try it out.  possibly the field may have a problem
with protections, but I believe it will work ok.

new techtip - preliminary - written to set the procedure for modifying
a node, or a =slot.

... any questions?  send me mail.  if the filed has a problem, call me
at home before 10:30 am, otherwise try me at the data center.

I have a 10:00am meeting wiht rick daniels there, but it is being postponed

Jack, (and Harry, does he have a new ontyme yet?)

    All files from systems 25 and 54 have been distributed to the suns.
Last I'd checked the protections and ownership access to the production
files was all ok.  All CMD files have been converted to sun format and
should need NO further modification (unless there are non-standard user
id's in source or patch file names).

   Backup script, nearly complete... attempting to mail from a script is
causing the hold up.  This will be completed today.  A warning is placed
to have the field use the Ontyme EXEC script until the backup script is
in place.

   Node (get/put) script under revision, however, prior version is in
place.  If everyone follows the rules, there will be no problems.  Of
course, educating everyone of the proper rules will be a minor issue and
may take a few days.  Better documentation is required... I'm working on
it, but it takes time to write good documentation, and I've had little
enough of that to make the scripts work.

   Distribution of sources, with gemini as the master, with automatich
checking now in place.  Automatic distribution is forthcoming.

   Fremont ops are working through each server performing a full backup
on each system.  We should soon have a full set of reliable backups.  We
do need to make a coupel of additional stand-alone backups of each critical
partition on each system, and we shall be protected against major disaster.

   The link to NTD was operational last Friday, however, due to problems
with the specific server, that link is currently down.  On our side, re-
initiating the link is somewhat trivial.  I've posted mail to all the
responsible people.

   Additional documentation and released products are now available from
NTD, presumably in B5 bubbnet lab... I plan to get those tapes today and
send via inter-office to Fremont.  This could be (should be) done by Network
Operations, however, I need to review the tape directories to determine
where the files actually should be located on all six servers.

  To the best of my knowledge both NAD and BITS work, other than the SNA/PBH
problems which are over to Pam W. for research.  I will call her back today
to obtain status prior to tomorrow's meeting.

   See you in the office soon.

due to problems with system 33, all of the user directories did NOT make it
to the suns, however, all was completed on the list through the end of cts.

on the script front, I'm still working on them...

I will make the backup.request script available as soon as I meet with Donna
and verify the information she needs to do a backup is complete.

our link is back up between boris and atlas.

i've been chasing down better sources for sna and friends... they are now
moved to the suns from system 26, but again, I have NOT had time or energy
to go in and test to see what problems do/don't exist in the new source files.

due to euske's insistance, we are getting cooperation from ntd.  I have a
meeting at 3:30 to go over our x25 configurations to verify and checkout any
potential problems we may have.

nothing else to report at this point...

   HAVE GOT A QUESTION THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ME WITH:
 
WHEN ISSUING THE FIND COMMAND TO LOCATE A DIRECTORY OR FILE THE SYSTEM
SEEMS TO RETURN A BOGUS PATH NAME. FOR EXAMPLE:
 
WHILE IN MY HOME DIRECTORY (/HOME/GEMINI/FTS/DHOLDERNESS) I ISSUE
"FIND 02167" <cr>
 
AND THE SYSTEM RETURNS WITH /MNT/XD4H/02167,
AND THEN ALL THE FILES FOLLOW. QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE "MNT/XD4H" ALL
ABOUT. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE ASK ME ABOUT THIS. THEY DO THE FIND,
THE SYSTEM RETURNS THE ABOVE AND THEY GET TO WHERE THEY WANNA BE. HOW-
EVER, WE THOUGHT THE CORRECT PATH WAS /TYM/2/02167.
PLEASE HELP CLEAR THIS QUESTION AS IT'S CAUSING SOME CONFUSION.

Subject: current sun status 

re: Thursday's activities.

1)  problem reported about user personal directories in accessible by the
    field users due to owner=root.  This was passed to Earl Sanchez in netqc.

2)  discussed what to do with field-service user-id's with Randy Ferguson and
    Cynthia Hoeke.  most probably will have separate login id's that use the
    same group directories.  eg.  WNFE, CNFE, ENFE instead of hundreds of fe
    directories.  need to research ownership privs before this can work.

3)  staged Malvern in Fremont.
    took all day... Joe and I worked together on this and I left to go to
    class at 6:40 leaving joe to finish up the last tape to send to Malvern.

    Operations will call you to get the address for Malvern, so they can fed-ex
    the tapes tomorrow.

    staging was successful.  "Malvern" was accessible to the net.  (!)

4)  system 25 took a head crash (in dallas) so all work done on that system
    prior to 19:00 cdt 07/19/89 was on tape, all other work is lost.  PI and
    TIP will have to re-do all projects and backups for 7/20.

    due to this, gemini is loaded with inferior code (not the latest) in the
    XCOM slot host 9929.   Also, hosts 5060 and 9752 are down... the XCOM
    slots in their places are host numbers 10655 and 10663 until system 25
    is available to reload these slots.

    Expect some calls until I can re-gen the code.  I am attempting (as I
    speak) to obtain tape backup copies of the code in (PDIXON:25) in my own
    directory on system 54, so that I can reload these 3 slots with the
    proper XCOM slot code.

---- (that was 2 days work) ----

5)  backing up to wednesday's missed status report...

    Tuesday was spent working on database research on the sun in C.  Other
    preparations for Malvern were also on the slate.

    Wednesday was spent working at home... mostly  making calls and making
    sure that preparations for Malvern "staging" were completed:  Host and
    username validations,  node and slot code prepared and slot code genned.

    Contacted FSCO to allow for diagnostics time on the two machines used for
    staging.  All went well, (no complaintes from FSCO as of this time), and
    the systems are NOW back up as themselves.


I'll be in after 10am.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXPLANATION ON THE PHYSICAL AND LOGICAL PATHS. HOWEVER,
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION.
 
WHEN I WAS IN SAN JOSE FOR THE ONE DAY UNIX CLASS GIVEN BY CARL BALTRUNAS
A DIRECTORY TREE WAS DRAWN ON THE BOARD. THIS TREE ILLUSTRATED THE PATHS
USED TO GET TO THE DIRECTORIES, SUB DIRECTORIES AND FILES.
 
EXAMPLE:  IF WE NEED TO FIND THE COMMAND FILE FOR NODE 2547, SLOT 2, PER
          THE TREE WE WOULD USE /TYM/2/02547/C02.
 
          BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE TREE AND YOU NEED TO FIND THE SAME
          FILE, USING THE FIND COMMAND GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT PATH.
 
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE CLASS IN SAN JOSE WENT BACK TO WORK AND STARTED
GIVING CLASSES TO ALL THE REST, UNAWARE OF THE PHYSICAL/LOGICAL PATHS.
THE CONFUSION COMES IN NOW. IF SOMEONE KNOWS A FILE IS IN THE TYM
DIRECTORY BUT DOESN'T KNOW THE ENTIRE PATH NAME THEY ISSUE THE FIND CMD.
THE FIND CMD RETURNS A PATH NAME THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN THE "TYM" DIRECTORY
ANYWHERE IN IT. BUT THEY WERE TOLD THAT THE CMD FILES ARE LOCATED IN THE
"TYM" DIRECTORY.
 
PERHAPS THIS IS A SMALL MATTER. HOWEVER, IT IS CAUSING CONFUSION IN THIS
OFFICE AND, I ASSUME, OTHERS. IS THERE ANY WAY TO MODIFY THE FIND COMMAND
TO LIST THE LOGICAL PATH INSTEAD OF THE PHYSICAL PATH??

Subject: sun status 

As of this writing...
  nad 2.14  and bits 2.10  have been installed on all sun servers in
fremont and also on boomer.

  the x25 slots have been regenned for fremont, and of these, atlas and
gemini have been reloaded.  the difference is the removal of the call-cleared
patch and the inactivity timeout patch.  The line appears to be MUCH MUCH
improved over the response after patsy added the abovmentioned patches.

  we will re-install them later... one at a time to see what they affect...
we still want STS to be involved, and maybe have them re-install them and
test the differences by examining the packet-traces to see what's different
and why the circuit is unreliable in it's "prior" state.

  still needed for nad testing, verification of /pdp/tape10/* with /ntdlib/*
and then moving the files across..  I was expecting to do this tonight (thurs)
but other problems surfaced...

  problems: x25 kept dropping, reloaded gemini and atlas and it appears to
be stable... needs more research, help from STS, etc.

            catalyst, the 3/60 workstation in fremont, appears to half-boot
and then dies waiting for gemini to let it mount it's exported root.  I have
NO idea what is wrong... /tftpboot appears ok, the ethernet seems ok, the
files in /export/root/catalyst appear ok, /etc/bootparams seems ok, /etc/hosts
and /etc/networks seems ok... but catalyst wil not boot.   ** wasted an hour
trying different things, no luck...

   will be in about noon.  call me if you need me earlier.

PS:  I expect to vrify the /pdp/tape10 files between noon and the 2:00 meeting
and hope to have more to report then.

PPS: asked terry kane to have sun look at the xd4 and xd5 drives on flyer.

Subject: Mux Gen and Load into the Public Network 

To All Concered:

	The following Ascii capture is a gen in Nad of our Mux slot code and
a load from the Sun system of that genned code into the public network.
I then was able to log out and log into our Mux slot and build circuits 
from the Mux.  Any questions can be directed to myself or Phil Kiefer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Yesterday, I encountered the following two problems in genning code
for our lab engine, node 3206, on the Sun systems.  

1.  Using "node get 3206", I was able to get only the c## files and
tym file.  I was not able to get the t## files for slots 1-5.  For
the t## files I got the message "permission denied".  Looking at the
the files in the tym/3/03206 directory I see that the files I was not
able to get have file permission rw-r----- and the files I was able
to get have file permission rw-rw-r--.  Node 3206 is our lab engine
and we should have permission to get all its files.  Could you change
the permission of the files I was not able to get so that our group can
obtain these files.

2.  Since I was not able to get node 3206 t## files using "node get
3206, I attempted to get them from the PDP-10 systems using netcopy.
Unfortunately, netcopy was not working either.  The error message I
got was "netcopy error in transmission."  I have used netcopy on
other dates successfully.

Could you please look into both these problems.  Thanks.

Regards,

Eric Takatori

Harry,

On Friday, 8/4/89, we attempted, but was unable to load our lab
engine, node 3322, using Bits on the Sun systems.  Below is a script
of the commands we used to load node 3322.  Could you tell us if the
errors we obtained were due to a problem with Bits or the commands we
entered.  

In the Bits manual, we noticed it mentions using the username "dload"
to load nodes.  Do we need to use this username to load our nodes, if
so we need the password for "dload".  If not can Bits use our
username "intltech" or would intltech need to be in the neighbor GGL.

Subject: Copying files to other users directories? 

To whom it may concern:

	I was wondering who I talk to about getting permission to copy
files into other CTS user directories.  For example, I have modified my
.cshrc to include some basic keystrokes within unix.  Now I wanted to copy
my .cshrc with the modified alias into other CTS Chicago directories.  Any
suggestions and or help??? Thanks....

It has been observed that the various methods of doing directory
listings (ex. ls -l) do not show the year of the file creation.  If
this is changeable, please do.  It may not be important now, but
in the future, a year display can be vital.

As requested, I was trying to log into the Malvern hosts 10655 & 10633
to test them.  However, I was getting the msg "access not permitted". I
looked in valinfo and these hosts weren't listed under my username.
Is this a global issue being pursued by the "sun group" or are the individual
offices responsible for contacting validations ?

Question

	I had defined some of my own macros and stored them under the
.cshrc file to be used when I log in.  I see that Fremont Center gave
all users a new .cshrc file.  Now my question is, Can I have a personal
.chsrc file that will allow me to create my own macro's, then store them
without the danger of Fremont updating all of our .cshrc files?

We seem to have a hole somewhere in our trouble reporting procedures.
This morning, all of the sun systems I attempt to log into are hanging
at the TERM prompt.  Who do I call?  I got through to an operator in
Fremont who was unaware of the problem and was going to page someone.
What is the proper thing to do?

              NEVERMIND ...  I had sent a problem to your
              attention concerning the backspace key not working
              on my PC.  I described that my PC showed a cntrl h
              on my screen whenever I hit the backspace key or
              control h.
 
              But I fixed the problem myself by editing my .login
              file on my userid (randerso).  I changed the delete
              key from cntrl ? to cntrl h.  The cntl ? never
              worked for me.
 
              Everything is ok now.
 
              Thanks,

Contact: TYMNET-NIS in Tokyo, Tim Stafford, 011(81-3)551-6220
Contact: Tymnet Customer Support, Elaine, (703)442-7875
Symptom: The command "R PCOM;ND1234.CTL" on system 37 did not start the
	PCOM job that they were using to gen Engine code.  It just sat there.
	Tim called the Dallas Data Center and got the hotline page number.
Problem: No free PTY pairs were available.  Running (CARL)TTYTAB showed them
	as all being marked "Zapped, Gone!".
Cause:	Unknown, it has been observed before, but not to the extent of
	having all lines 201, 203, 205, ... 307 all out of commission.
Fix:	Manually zeroed out LDBLOG on all PTY lines by using MDDT, ^W,
	-1$0G, LINTAB+201/, <tab>, .+LDBLOG/, 0, etc.

   SYSTEM GETTING BADPAG, RIBERR, RIBHRE AND WRTSAT
   MESSAGES BEFORE IT CRASHED WITH STOPCODE 'UFDER1'. JOE SMITH CONTACTED
   AND SAID TO BRING SYSTEM BACK UP.  FULL DSKCLN DONE AT 8:21.
	DATE:  10-15-89   DOWN:  0912   ANS:  1845
   ALL ATTEMPTS TO COPY OUT 300203 (PER JOE SMITH) FAILED.
   COPY WOULD ABORT. JOE CAME IN AND FIXED BAD PAGES AND ANOTHER 
   ATTEMPT TO COPY OUT 300203 WAS MADE. IT ABORTED WITH UUO ERROR.
   A ONE PACK ASP WAS THEN DONE FOR DSKB3 PER JOE. THE SAVE
   AND RESTORE WENT WELL. BPA1 (300203) IS NOW ON DRIVE D1.
   IT WAS PREVIOUSLY ON DRIVE F1. SYSTEM  WAS RUN THRU A FULL
   DSKCLN AFTER RESTORE AND CAME UP WITH NO PROBLEMS.
Problem:  The system detected a bad block on the disk.  While it was
	attempting to mark the bad block in the BAT pages, it thought
	it got another write error, and ended up putting garbage in
	the BAT page.  The PAKCOPY program refused to copy the data to
	a net disk pack because it said the BAT page was invalid.
Fix:	  I went to the Data Center and manually initialized the BAT pages
	on DSKB3.  I ran a full DSKCLN in CONSOLE mode; it reported only
	two files damaged.  Ironically, one was the log file from my
	program that runs at 7:30am to find damaged files and report them.
	In the process of checking the file system, two soft data errors
	were detected on DSKB3.  I recommended that they copy out the pack.
	PAKCOPY aborted during the copy; they then used the ASP program to
	copy that one pack to tape, and restore it on another disk pack.

Problem:   Bad spot on DSKB10 caused the SATs and LUD.SYS to be damaged.
Fix:	LUD.SYS was restored from the previous night's backup tape.
	Since DSKCLN cannot start until LUD.SYS is restored, and since
	the SATs had not been rewritten because DSKCLN had not run, then
	the newly restored LUD.SYS used pages that were allocated to
	another file.  It was the usual 29 minutes for a FULL DSKCLN,
	29 more minutes for pass two of DSKCLN, and 15 minutes of output
	to the CTY listing each and every multiply-used page.  LUD.SYS
	was re-restored, and the system came up OK.
Note:  The problem on 2-Oct was with DSKB0, this time it was DSKB10.

I have encountered a problem while attempting to gen code for a new slot. 
The node involved is 2146, slot 2.  This is a new X.75 gateway for US
West.  I created the C02 and T02 files on my PC.  I then logged into the
Sun system and ran node get.  It created the 02146 subdirectory and
informed me that the C02 and T02 files did not exist.  I uploaded the new
files via kermit and ran nad.  I then executed node put to transfer the
files to the stageing areas.  Node put told me that the C02 and T02 files
were not checked out and moved the N02 file to stageing.  I then ran node
update, which accepted all my information, gaily informed me that the C02
and T02 files did not exist, and terminated.  It would seem that this
Check-Out/Check-In procedure does not work very well unless the code files
already exist in the production areas.  The man pages do not mention
anything about creating new code, only about how to modify existing code. 

If you have any other questions, I can be reached at (703)556-3278.

Subject: sildview 

Bill,
  I have been playing with a copy of sild (copied from niagara:~wrs/src/sild,
if I remember correctly.. not from any of the sild subdirectories).  I have
a modified version that reads in a font, instead of creating one, for some of
the sizes (creates one if it doesn't find a font).

  I also have a variant program "sildview" which utilizes your "load" code
to read in the .iw file, and the specified font and write it to the screen.
Right now, it simply computes the brightness/contrast stuff and sends it to
a pixrect (the screen).

  I'm going to modify it and a copy of "scload" to make it a little fancier
and acceptE command line aguments for 1) inverse-video, 2) brightness/contrast
settings, 3) clipping offsets [t,b,l & r] to display the picture.

  Joe had the suggestion that the brightness, contrast and clipping info be
available on the first line of the .iw file as initial parameters... maybe by
having sild re-write the .iw file with the appropriate info.

(I suggest maybe reading the new data directly into the pel array and writing
the .iw file after computing the default contrast/brightness and maybe doing
some adjustment check to find the real left edge/top and writing clipping info
to the .iw file initially) ... or some of this anyway.  This requires that all
older versions of sild be trashed, or changed so they don't throw away sild
data files with this extended first line.)  I'm willing to do the work, but
since it is *your* program, I thought you'd like to suggest/direct my efforts.


P.S.  Thank you for the use of the iw/camera setup.  I've called you a couple
      of times with no answer, so we assumed that you have had no immediate
      requirements for your equipment back.  We have taken very good care of
      it and have digitized a reasonable amounbt of stuff.

      I've been using my VCR to power the camera, but expect to be taking it
      home sometime this week.  Let me know if you want the equipment back
      immediately, or if we can utilize it (as we have) in testing my new sild
      versions.

/Carl



PPS.  If you want, I can copy my sildview sources to antares or niagara...
      If I don't hear from you, I'll wait till I make my next barrage of
      changes, then send you a copy.  If you want a pre-release copy, I'll
      hear from you sooner.

Subject: Re: sildview 

As I said on the phone, I like the idea of putting command line arguments in
line 1 of the SILD file.  I think this overcomes the desire to use standard
raster file format.  Anything that is a command line argument should be able
to be changed in the parameter control panel.  Then there should be a SAVE
button to write the first line of the SILD file.  You might pad the first line
to some reasonable length with trailing blanks so you don't have to rewrite
the whole file, or maybe its not worth it.  At any rate, don't require or
assume the blanks are there.

Also add some kind of center weighting is good.  Maybe make it a control panel
parameter.  You could have an icon that shows the general shape of the
weighting.  The patterns I think that there should be is:
  all (almost useless)
  center rectangle (.5X by .5Y)
  center elipse (.25X by .25Y)
  center infinity (.5X by .25Y)
There should be a button that makes the center weight pattern visible for as
long as you hold the left mouse button down (this is tricky, but possible).

I clearly like you croping idea.  You know, where you save the clipping
limits in the SILD file.  I don't know the best way to specify the clip limits.
I think a variety of ways is in order.  You certainly want to be able to type
in the size in pixels, and be able to "jog" the image around.  You probably
want to be able to just draw the box as well.

There should be a way to do a ditherfilter menu.  Perhaps a seperate panel.
You should be able to pick one of the existing filters or type in the name
and options of one of your own.  The filter should just be specified as a
command line, such as "rasfilter8to1 -5" and it should take an 8-bit raster
file as standard input and produce a 1-bit raster file as standard output.
The color map for the 8 bit file should reflect the brightness and contrast
settings currently in force.  (i.e. the filter should not have to deal with
that because you want to be able to use off-the-shelf filters, as well as
be able to use the filters written for this with off-the-shelf raster files.

Enough bable.  This is all just a repeat of how I remember our conversation.
I would like to hack on sild, but it will be a long time, and I don't have
any problem with handing it over to you for now.  If I really get the itch,
I'll worry about that then.  Yours can be the "official" copy.  Have fun!
-Bill

New for version 2.1

Display options that include the following:

	-a		Suppress Author Text
	-c		Suppress Color Cycling
	-d <dir>	Display all pictures in a directory
	-f <file>	Read a text file for picture names
	-h<n>   	Change the display height of a picture
	-l   		List picture information
	-m<x>   	Select view modes.

	Color Cycling continues while next picture is loaded.
	Scroll around in large pictures.
	Pointer Clearing during picture viewing.

Overscan sizing and positioning has also been improved.

New controls:

	Left Mouse 	Button Scrolls around in a picture
	Right Mouse 	Button Continues to next picture
	Spacebar 	Starts and stops the color cycling
	ESC 		Aborts the command line


Using SuperView from WorkBench.

SuperView has a complete WorkBench (Icon) interface built in.  
To use SuperView from WorkBench, you must have an icon for your picture. 
Most all paint programs build icons for you as you save a picture, so 
this should not be a problem.  There are two ways to view pictures at 
this point.  The easy way is to click once on the picture icon, hold 
down the shift key, and then double click the SuperView icon.  You can 
reverse this and click once on the SuperView icon and double click your 
picture icon.  To view more that one picture,  you hold down the shift 
key and click each picture that you want to show and the SuperView icon.  
You don't have to select the icons in any kind of order as long as you 
double click the last icon you select.  The pictures will be displayed 
in the order that you select them.  You can also make the picture icon 
itself run SuperView by putting SuperView in the default tool of the 
icon.  This way you can just double click the picture icon to view it.  
For a detailed description of how this is done, see the article in 
Ami Exchange Mag V1.4.  

After the picture is loaded from workbench, you can stop and start the 
color cycling with the spacebar, hold down the left mouse button to 
scroll around in a large bitmap picture, press the right mouse button 
to go to the next picture,  or press the ESC key to abort. Pressing the 
ESC key will remove the current picture and cancel out any pictures that 
you had selected that you have not viewed yet.


Using SuperView from the CLI

Here is where the real power of SuperView comes out.  
From the CLI,  you can choose many display options that allow you to 
view a picture in different ways.  The command line from the CLI is

1> SuperView [option[...]] <fileName> [[option[...]] <fileName>].... 

You can use up to 255 characters on the command line.  
Here is a list of the options and how to use them.

	-a	Suppress Author Text

If you use this option, no Author text will be displayed from the AUTH 
chunk in the IFF file.  

Example: 

1> SuperView -a Mickey


	-c	Suppress Color Cycling

This option will prevent the picture from color cycling.  If you use this 
option,  the spacebar will not start color cycling.  

Example:

1> SuperView -c Spray


	-d <dir>	Display all pictures in a directory

The -d option will take the name of a directory instead of a picture 
name and display every picture that if finds in that directory.  
SuperView will overlook files that are not pictures, so you wont have 
to worry about having non-picture files in the directory.  Any options 
that you select before the directory name will stay in effect for each 
picture in the directory.  After the directory has been displayed, 
SuperView will continue on with the rest of the command line.  This 
option works well with the -s option. 

Example:

1> SuperView -d df0:
1> SuperView -s10 -c -d df0:
1> SuperView -s10 -d -a df1: -r


	-f <file>	Read a text file for picture names

This option will read a text file and use it as a script to display 
pictures.  The format of the file is the same as the format of each 
picture on the command line.  

Example:

-a Mickey
-s10 MyPicture
-d -s10 -c df0:
GreatPic
-x200 -y100 BigPic

Each picture in the file can have its own options.  When all of the files 
have been displayed,  SuperView will continue with the rest of the 
command line.

Example:

1> SuperView -f MyScript
1> SuperView -f MyScript -r
1> SuperView -f MyScript -s10 Spray


	-h<n>   Change the display height of a picture
	-w<n>	Change the display width

These two options change the display size of a picture.  You can use one 
or both of them on a picture.  These options change the display size of 
the picture, not the size of the picture.   If you tell it to use a 
smaller display size than the picture is, you will be able to scroll 
around in the smaller display area.  The best way to under stand this may 
be to try it.   

Example:

1> SuperView -w320 -h200 Mickey
1> SuperView -w320 -h200 -m Mickey
1> SuperView -w200 -h100 -x60 -y50 Spray


	-l   List picture information

If you want to know the size of a picture, or if it is HAM or HalfBrite, 
then this is your option.  This will list out the size of the display 
area,  the size of the picture, what type of file it is (ILBM, ACBM, 
ANIM), any display modes, number of colors and bit planes. 

Example:

1> SuperView -l Mickey
1> SuperView -l -s10 Mickey
1> SuperView -l -w400 Mickey


 If you want to save this information to disk or printer,  you may 
redirect the output:

1> SuperView >Prt: -d -l df1:

This line will show each picture on drive df1: and list the information 
to the printer.


	-m<x>   Select view modes  
		h = HAM 
		r = HiRes 
		l =Lace
		b = HalfBrite

This will allow you to change any display modes that you want.  The 
display modes that are supported are,  Hi-Res (640 display), 
Lace (interlace), HAM (Hold And Modify), and Extra-HalfBrite.  If you 
just select -m option without any letters following it, all modes will be 
cleared.  If the modes are clear, you will get a standard lo-res screen.  
This is good for taking a Hi-Res, Lace picture and making it Lo-Res.

Example:

1> SuperView -w320 -h200 -m Mickey
1> SuperView -w320 -h200 -ml Mickey

This will give you a 320 X 200 picture of Mickey that you can scroll 
around in.  

	-o   Override the Auto Overscan 

This will cause SuperView to display the picture exactly like the IFF 
file said to.  No attempt to size or place the picture is made.

Example:

1> SuperView -o Spray


	-p   Disables Pointer Clearing

If you don't want your pointer to disappear when showing the picture,  
then use this option.

Example:

1> SuperView -p Mickey


	-r   Repeat command line

This will cause SuperView to repeat the command line in a loop.  With 
this option, the -s and -d or -f options, you can make a slide show.  
This is the only option that you put after everything else and everything 
past the -r is ignored.  The only way to stop this is to hit the ESC key.

Example:

1> SuperView Mickey Spray -r
1> SuperView -s10 Mickey -s5 Spray -r


	-s<n>  Display picture for n seconds

This option will remove the picture after n seconds.  You can still 
continue by pressing the right mouse button or ESC key.  This option 
and the -d option work well together.

Example:

1> SuperView -s10 Mickey
1> SuperView -s10 -d df1:


	-t[<n>]	Double Buffer

This option will take two (default) or more pictures and cycle them to the 
front at a rate of 60 times per second.  This may not seem useful,  but 
there are some reasons for including it.  Double Buffering is mostly used
to hide the area that you are drawing in until it is ready to be displayed.
Most of the time it is a animation.  Durring some test with Double Buffering
I found that if you swap complete screens,  you can also change the colors.
Try this,  load up a paint program,  make a red (filled) box in the middle
of the screen.  Now save this as pic1.  Next change the box to blue and
save as pic2.  Then type the following line

1> SuperView -t pic1 pic2

Notice that the box is now a different color.  This is real useful in
smoothing out pictures and you can make it look like you have more than
32 colors on the screen at once.  More info on how to use this option
will be made available on the AmigaLine BBS at (405) 354-8061 including
a way to make Hi-Res 4096 color photos from the amiga.

If you want to buffer more than two pictures,  supply the number of 
pictures after the -t option like

1> SuperView -t4 pic1 pic2 pic3 pic4


	-u	Dual Playfield

Did you ever wonder what dual playfield was like.  Well with this option,
you can take any two pictures that are three bit planes (or less) and 
display them in dual playfield mode.  After the picture is displayed, 
you can scroll around in each picture (if the picture is larger than the
screen).  To do this, hold down the left mouse button and slide the mouse
around.  The back ground picture will scroll,  now release the button and
hold it down again,  this time the front picture will scroll.  Each time
you press the left button the scrolling picture will change.  To use this 
option,  type in the fore ground picture first and then the back ground
picture like

1> SuperView -u pic1 pic2


	-x<n>	Change the position of the display area x
	-y<n>	Change the position of the display area y

The -x and -y options are used to position the display area on the screen. 
For overscan, you need to shift the picture to the left and up from the 
normal 0x 0y so you use  -x-16 to shift left and -y-8 to shift up. Also, 
if you want to change the display size with the -w and -h options, you 
can center the smaller screen with these options.

Example:

1> SuperView -x20 -y10 Mickey
1> SuperView -w200 -h100 -x60 -y50 Spray

 
If you have any problems with the program, you can leave me a message
on AmigaLine BBS at (405) 354-8061....

ok, ok... so the dates and the protections are wrong... you can't have
everything the first time.  as soon as I find out what format the dates
are stored in and how to map {NO, LK, RUN, RD, AP, UPD, CP, ALL} into
unix <rwx> I'll fix that stuff.  (Isn't that what CHMOD and CHOWN are for?)

PS. Joe, Osman:  If you happen to know where the date-time stuff is in the
    documentation, drop me a line, so I can incorporate this stuff soon!

Why didn't you try the obvious?  For 12:29:12 PDT, use 4434344010 octal.
(((((1989-1970)*365+1+1+1+1+1)+(31+28+31+30)+(17-1))*24+(12+7))*60+29)*60+12.
Everything in Unix is based on the number of seconds since 1-Jan-1970 0:00 GMT
which is 31-Dec-1969 16:00 PDT.  (Try "od -c foo.tar" on a file created today)

yeah... welll... I thought that that was the date, but I wanted to be sure...
...absolutely sure... before I put it into the code.  Now, I'm sure!

acturlly i have date-since-1-1-64 + minutes since midnight
to convert to seconds since 1-1-70 and that is pretty trivial.

CARL, THE VERSIONS OF BITS AND NAD AND TYMLIB THAT HAVE BEEN
INSTALLED ON THE FREMONT SUNS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TARRED OFF BORIS, WHICH 
WAS RUNNING 4.0. STEVE DID A LOT OF TESTS ON BITS AND NAD ON 4.0. IN 
CHECKIGN WITH ALEX TING, HE MENTIONED THAT TYMLIB TOO WAS CHANGED FOR 
4.0. I JUST TALKED WITH DAVE HOPKINS, AND HE IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. 
DAVE WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM.

RE- UNIX TAPE

GUYS, APPARENTLY THE VERSIONS OF NAD, BITS, TYMLIB THAT WAS INSTALLED
ON FREMONT WERE NOT THE CORRECT ONES. CARL TRIED TO USE BITS AND IT
DID NOT WORK. AFTER TALKING TO A FEW PEOPLE, INCLUDING LES SEZTER, THE
OPINION IS THAT WE NEED THE VERSIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING
ON BORIS-THIS SHOULD INCLUDE THE MODIFIED VERSION OF TYMLIB 2.02,
NAD 2.12 AND BITS 2.10-THESE ARE MENTIONED ON THE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
PORT TO SUN OS4 DOCUMENT. ANYHOW, THE UNIX PRODUCT TAPE THAT IS ON
BORIS IS BELIEVED TO BE THE CORRECT ONE TO BE INSTALLED ON FREMONT.

DAVE, IF YOU ARE GOING TO FREMONT TO INSTALL THIS TAPE, CAN YOU MAKE
SURE THAT YOU GET IT FROM BORIS AND , IF POSSIBLE, GO THERE
IN THE MORNING SO THAT CARL CAN USE IT IN HIS TRAINING CLASS IN
ATLANTA IN THE AFTERNOON(6/2). IN ANY CASE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT
ALL THE CORRECT VERSIONS ARE INSTALLED ON FREMONT BY MONDAY BECAUSE
OF THE FIELD TRAINING CLASS ON TUESDAY, JUNE 6TH.

SO, IN SUMMARY, WE NEED THE UNIX PRODUCT TAPE PACKAGE FROM BORIS
A.S.A.P. AND PLEASE CALL KRISH NARAYAN OR MYSELF IF YOU HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS OR NEED ANY TYPE OF ASSISTANCE. I AM AT X7359 AND KRISH
AT X7507.

AGAIN, THANKS FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION TO THIS URGENT MATTER.PHILIPPE

We are sending the following memo to you as managers in the license tree.
Please ensure that all users under your management comply.

The Validations Department is in the process of updating our current infor-
mation on employees who have status names.

We appreciate your cooperation, and we hope you understand that this is a
necessary step to improve the security of our Network. Basically, it will 
provide accountability, and will give us immediate access to the person that
owns the status name.

This security enhancement is particularly significant in light of the recent
unfortunate publicity about Tymnet Security practices. Call me (X7316) if
you'd like a copy of the article.



We are requesting that anyone who currently has a status name, run our exec
** license.req. This exec will prompt you for the information that we need
in order to update our files. It will be available on or before 12-12-88.

People who have not provided the required information by January 13,1989,
will be barred from setting license after that date.

I don't want to print an ever-increasing FACT.LOG every day, but I do

Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behalf" of another user.

1. is 39 still up somewhere (i.e. 39's packs)?

   of FRMRUN library on 74 that causes problems?

			      MARRIAGE HUMOR



       Mostly from ``Another Almanac of	Words at Play'', by Willard
       Espy.

	  + ``It doesn't much signify whom one marries,	for one	is
	    sure to find out next morning it was someone else.'' --
	    Rogers

	  + ``If you are afraid	of loneliness, don't marry.'' --
	    Chekhov

	  + ``The most happy marriage I	can picture would be the
	    union of a deaf man	to a blind woman.'' -- Coleridge

	  + ``Were it not for imagination, sir,	a man would be as
	    happy in the arms of a chambermaid as a duchess.'' --
	    Dr.	 Johnson

	  + ``If a man hears much that a woman says, she is not
	    beautiful.'' -- Haskins

	  + ``A	man does not look behind the door unless he has
	    stood there	himself.'' -- Du Bois

	  + ``A	lover tries to stand in	well with the pet dog of
	    the	house.'' -- Moliere

	  + ``Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing; a
	    confusion of the real with the ideal never goes
	    unpunished.'' -- Goethe

	  + ``In matrimony, to hesitate	is sometimes to	be saved.''
	    -- Butler

	  + ``A	woman may very well form a friendship with a man,
	    but	for this to endure, it must be assisted	by a little
	    physical antipathy.'' -- Nietzsche

	  + ``Men who cherish for women	the highest respect are
	    seldom popular with	them.''	-- author unknown

	  + ``Woman inspires us	to great things, and prevents us
	    from achieving them.'' -- Dumas

	  + ``Nature has given women so	much power that	the law	has
	    very wisely	given them little.'' --	Dr.  Johnson

	  + ``The great	question... which I have not been able to
	    answer... is, "What	does a woman want?''  -- Freud

	  + ``Home life	as we understand it is no more natural to
	    us than a cage is to a cockatoo.'' -- Shaw


	  + ``Marriage is like a cage; one sees	the birds outside
	    desperate to get in, and those inside desperate to get
	    out.''  -- Montaigne

	  + ``For a male and female to live continuously together
	    is...  biologically	speaking, an extremely unnatural
	    condition.'' -- Robert Briffault

	  + ``Marriage is low down, but	you spend the rest of your
	    life paying	for it.'' -- Baskins

	  + A wedding is a funeral where a man smells his own
	    flowers.

	  + A man is not complete until	he is married -- then he is
	    finished.

	  + Marriage is	a rest period between romances.

	  + Marriage is	the sole cause of divorce.

	  + Marriage is	a trip between Niagra Falls and	Reno.

	  + Marriage is	an institution -- but who wants	to live	in
	    one?

	  + Marriage is	the process of finding out what	kind of
	    person your	spouse would have really preferred.

	  + Marriage is	the triumph of imagination over
	    intelligence.  Second marriage is the triumph of hope
	    over experience.

	  + Marriage is	not a word; it is a sentence.

Subject: TURBO MEETINGS, ETC. 

I have the following items of information that you need to be aware of.

        - There will be a brief Turbo meeting Fri., 3/10, in F - 655 at 3:00.

        - There will be a meeting to review Turbo limitations on Mon., 3/13,
          in F - 655 at 1:30.

        - QA will be responsible for two documents regarding Turbo.

                One is the document that goes out with the release of
                Turbo reporting the results of our tests.

                Two is a document which states the
                limitations of Turbo at a high level.
                (Example: There must be at least one SIO link to
                 the Turbo for loading.)

The second document will be the topic of discussion at the Monday meeting.
Please bring to that meeting a list of the limitations you can
identify for your product and any others you are aware of.  This is not a 
composition test.  Bullet items will do.

Mary,
  I did not receive/read your Ontyme about Friday's meeting until late on
Friday... 

  This next week, I will be away taking an Intensive C class offered by the
UC Santa Cruz Extension in Santa Clara 9-5pm.  If we need to get together
please send me mail:
    on antares:  carl, or doctor!carl
    on PDP-10s:  carl@F74     (this also works from antares)
    on Ontyme:   TXS.C/Baltrunas

This means I will not be at the meeting on Monday 3/13.  I will let Joe
know about the meeting (he should also have gotten your mail) and depending
on his schedule, I expect he will be at the meeting.

-Carl

PS.  Have you heard anything more about the release of TEFS?  Mar 3 has
     come and gone, and Joe and I are still waiting for the 1.10 release.
     As of friday 3/10, I have not heard anything.

As you may have noticed in my previous posting, I've invented a new name

that says what we do.. Not just SUPPORT, we are software engineers, so we
should publish that fact, make the company realize that we think, design,
create, (in effect: engineer) and provide support, hand-holding, etc....

Please, no flames... I don't remember our exact "real" name anymore, I mean
I use it so often... sigh!

	    us than a cage is to a cockatoo.'' -- Shaw


	  + ``Marriage is like a cage; one sees	the birds outside
	    desperate to get in, and those inside desperate to get
	    out.''  -- Montaigne

	  + ``For a male and female to live continuously together
	    is...  biologically	speaking, an extremely unnatural
	    condition.'' -- Robert Briffault

	  + ``Marriage is low down, but	you spend the rest of your
	    life paying	for it.'' -- Baskins

	  + A wedding is a funeral where a man smells his own
	    flowers.

	  + A man is not complete until	he is married -- then he is
	    finished.

	  + Marriage is	a rest period between romances.

	  + Marriage is	the sole cause of divorce.

	  + Marriage is	a trip between Niagra Falls and	Reno.

	  + Marriage is	an institution -- but who wants	to live	in
	    one?

	  + Marriage is	the process of finding out what	kind of
	    person your	spouse would have really preferred.

	  + Marriage is	the triumph of imagination over
	    intelligence.  Second marriage is the triumph of hope
	    over experience.

	  + Marriage is	not a word; it is a sentence.

Subject: TURBO MEETINGS, ETC. 

I have the following items of information that you need to be aware of.

        - There will be a brief Turbo meeting Fri., 3/10, in F - 655 at 3:00.

        - There will be a meeting to review Turbo limitations on Mon., 3/13,
          in F - 655 at 1:30.

        - QA will be responsible for two documents regarding Turbo.

                One is the document that goes out with the release of
                Turbo reporting the results of our tests.

                Two is a document which states the
                limitations of Turbo at a high level.
                (Example: There must be at least one SIO link to
                 the Turbo for loading.)

The second document will be the topic of discussion at the Monday meeting.
Please bring to that meeting a list of the limitations you can
identify for your product and any others you are aware of.  This is not a 
composition test.  Bullet items will do.

              TURBO ENGINE SYSTEM INTEGRATION TEAM STATUS REPORT

7:48AM  3/20/1989
Current Events
--------------
1) We spent friday configuring the system with an X.25 slot on GP.130, which
   is connected to another X.25 slot in 4013.  The intent is to benchmark the
   X.25 product and prove or disprove the claim of 5000 cps of user data 
   capacity for a Turbo.  We still have yet to set up Thruput host slots,
   but we do have virtually everything else configured.  With a little luck
   we will produce X.25 capacity figures by end of day today.

Problems/Issues
---------------
1) There seems to be a "wall" at around 170 packets per second.  Although the
   machine still seems to have cpu capacity at this level, we cannot induce it
   to build more packets.
2) IOC-8 ports have proven unreliable and unstable.  Any attempt to place even
   a small amount of traffic on these ports results in ports going into a state
   where the node code thinks they are transmitting packets but they are not.
3) Sync lines (Tymsync) are unstable, and exhibit similar behavior as IOC-8
   ports, even on an IOC-4.  We observe the correlation between issues 2 and 3 
   with Alain's open NSRs.

NOTES AS PER MARCH 2, 1989 PROGRAM REVIEW:

(1)  Slippage due to NTD delays including LTD.  In addition on 
     4/17/89 NTD predicts Single Node Code + X.25 will be 
     released with known and documented deficiencies.

(2)  Pending SAS sales status. 

(3)  Performance figures will include Single Node Code, X.25 only, 
     Single Node Code + X.25 and multiple GPs with Single Node 
     code and serveral X.25s.

(4)  Slippage due to use of machine for UL and FCC.

(5)  Turbo-Engine will be able to run in a virtual sub-net upon 
     initial release.  However, billing by port numbers (should 
     this be desired) will be impossible until MIS modifies billing 
     software to accommodate different port number format utilized 
     by Turbo-Engine.

In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 31 Mar 89 7:24:58 PST

The CRON program reads (SYS)CRON.CTL and executes particular programs at
specified times.  In some cases, it is more reliable than SUBMIT/XEXEC when
it comes to logging in programs that run at system startup.

It is named after the cron program on Unix.  When you get your Sun manuals,
look up cron in section 8 and crontab in section 5.  It's worth knowing about.

Subject: sildview 

Bill,
  I have been playing with a copy of sild (copied from niagara:~wrs/src/sild,
if I remember correctly.. not from any of the sild subdirectories).  I have
a modified version that reads in a font, instead of creating one, for some of
the sizes (creates one if it doesn't find a font).

  I also have a variant program "sildview" which utilizes your "load" code
to read in the .iw file, and the specified font and write it to the screen.
Right now, it simply computes the brightness/contrast stuff and sends it to
a pixrect (the screen).

  I'm going to modify it and a copy of "scload" to make it a little fancier
and acceptE command line aguments for 1) inverse-video, 2) brightness/contrast
settings, 3) clipping offsets [t,b,l & r] to display the picture.

  Joe had the suggestion that the brightness, contrast and clipping info be
available on the first line of the .iw file as initial parameters... maybe by
having sild re-write the .iw file with the appropriate info.

(I suggest maybe reading the new data directly into the pel array and writing
the .iw file after computing the default contrast/brightness and maybe doing
some adjustment check to find the real left edge/top and writing clipping info
to the .iw file initially) ... or some of this anyway.  This requires that all
older versions of sild be trashed, or changed so they don't throw away sild
data files with this extended first line.)  I'm willing to do the work, but
since it is *your* program, I thought you'd like to suggest/direct my efforts.


P.S.  Thank you for the use of the iw/camera setup.  I've called you a couple
      of times with no answer, so we assumed that you have had no immediate
      requirements for your equipment back.  We have taken very good care of
      it and have digitized a reasonable amounbt of stuff.

      I've been using my VCR to power the camera, but expect to be taking it
      home sometime this week.  Let me know if you want the equipment back
      immediately, or if we can utilize it (as we have) in testing my new sild
      versions.

/Carl



PPS.  If you want, I can copy my sildview sources to antares or niagara...
      If I don't hear from you, I'll wait till I make my next barrage of
      changes, then send you a copy.  If you want a pre-release copy, I'll
      hear from you sooner.

Subject: Re: sildview 

As I said on the phone, I like the idea of putting command line arguments in
line 1 of the SILD file.  I think this overcomes the desire to use standard
raster file format.  Anything that is a command line argument should be able
to be changed in the parameter control panel.  Then there should be a SAVE
button to write the first line of the SILD file.  You might pad the first line
to some reasonable length with trailing blanks so you don't have to rewrite
the whole file, or maybe its not worth it.  At any rate, don't require or
assume the blanks are there.

Also add some kind of center weighting is good.  Maybe make it a control panel
parameter.  You could have an icon that shows the general shape of the
weighting.  The patterns I think that there should be is:
  all (almost useless)
  center rectangle (.5X by .5Y)
  center elipse (.25X by .25Y)
  center infinity (.5X by .25Y)
There should be a button that makes the center weight pattern visible for as
long as you hold the left mouse button down (this is tricky, but possible).

I clearly like you croping idea.  You know, where you save the clipping
limits in the SILD file.  I don't know the best way to specify the clip limits.
I think a variety of ways is in order.  You certainly want to be able to type
in the size in pixels, and be able to "jog" the image around.  You probably
want to be able to just draw the box as well.

There should be a way to do a ditherfilter menu.  Perhaps a seperate panel.
You should be able to pick one of the existing filters or type in the name
and options of one of your own.  The filter should just be specified as a
command line, such as "rasfilter8to1 -5" and it should take an 8-bit raster
file as standard input and produce a 1-bit raster file as standard output.
The color map for the 8 bit file should reflect the brightness and contrast
settings currently in force.  (i.e. the filter should not have to deal with
that because you want to be able to use off-the-shelf filters, as well as
be able to use the filters written for this with off-the-shelf raster files.

Enough bable.  This is all just a repeat of how I remember our conversation.
I would like to hack on sild, but it will be a long time, and I don't have
any problem with handing it over to you for now.  If I really get the itch,
I'll worry about that then.  Yours can be the "official" copy.  Have fun!

As  we  discussed,  there  is  also  a need for two directories to be set up
under  /NTDLIB.    The  first is RELCODE and the second is DEVCODE.  Both of
these  directories  will  include  source  files  to  be  referenced  during
assemblies.      Please  let  me  know  if  I  can  provide  any  additional

===============================

Francine,

     Usernames  fblas, lbustillo, verickson and spurcell have
been validated with the password  of  sum mer .  I have targetted
each of these usernames and  jwagner  to host the Sun servers in 
Fremont.  See below for an explanation:



     I have targetted usernames listed in your ontyme to the
following SUN hosts:

     4644-Saturn
     5060-Mercury
     8875-Atlas
     9752-Titan
     9928-Delta
     9929-Gemini

     Your people must use the colon option to reach one of these
hosts.  The validation within the Sun (secondary logons) is being
handled by Cynthia Hoeke (X7086 NSC.C/Hoeke).  Please contact her
for any problems you encounter after reaching your destination host.

     If you have more questions, please let me know.

Thank you,

	Is there any way I can set two different TERMs in same .login file?
	
	Is it possible you can give us half hour some time this week to answer

THIS PROJECT IS ADDING A 16 PORT TERMINAL INTERFACE CONSAT
SLOT ON N2237/FREMONT.  EQUIPMENT (2-PSM ASYNC D/BDS, 2-PSM 
ASYNC BREAKOUT CABLES, 4-RIBBON CABLES, 17 JJ CROSSOVERS)
SHIPPING TO YOUR SITE YESTERDAY, 6/21, I'M TOLD.

I'M ALSO TOLD THAT FSC WILL NOT BE DOING THE INSTALL; THEREFORE,
THERE WILL BE NO PROJECT REPORT.  TYMNET IS GENNING NEW NODE
CODE FOR N2237 & SUN SYSTEM INSTALLERS WILL DO THE INSTALL OF
HARDWARE.... THIS WAS EXPEDITED - INSTALL TODAY, 6/22?

JUST F.Y.I....

Jack,
  please relay to tom that the x29 log that I thought had user id's of
each person that logged in DOES NOT.  I saw the list of users in a binary
file (which requires some amount of work to pull the usernames out).

I will attempt a few file restructures and see what kind of a list we
can generate for tom sometime on wednesday.  i will also update the documents
on how to gen/load a node (if I have time).

 >>> this WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY -- IF NTD HAD DELIVERED A FULL UNIX PRODUCT
     TAPE... we have a few products: nad, bits, cksum ... but no documentation
     was included, so I cannot even point the cs's at te manual pages...
     Could we have a little pressure from you or tom... bot phillippe and I
     have repetedly asked for this software from diana.    (both, not bot)

 >>> expect to be in around 10ish.  If you need me earlier, please call me
     at home and wake me up.

-goodnight

UPDATED:  06-29-89

RESTORE PROCEDURES FOR TAPES RECEIVED FROM DALLAS ON SUN SYSTEMS
________________________________________________________________


DALLAS will be sending the Center tapes of files stored from
the directory of TYMNET:25, TYM5:54, and NETLOAD:25/54 to be
restored on the SUN Systems.

     GEMINI - (TYMNET:25)

     SATURN - (TYM5:54)

     GEMINI - (NETLOAD:25/54)

Upon receipt of these tapes, Operators are requested to do the
following:

     a.  On GEMINI and SATURN, if you are not at the logon
prompt and 'top' is running (this is like a SYSTAT on the
PDP-10's), enter 'q' without a carriage return.  This should
put you at the prompt.

     b.  Mount the tape from System 25 on GEMINI's tape drive
WITHOUT the write ring and load the tape.

     c.  At the prompt, type in 'piload' (lower case please), 
with a carriage return.

     d.  At the next prompt, type in:

         cd /pdp (CR)          (You are now connected to this
                                directory)

     e.  At the next prompt ((/pdp) piload@gemini%)), type in:

         tar -xvi              (Files should now be restoring
                                to this directory)

     As each file is restored, it will print out on the screen.
     This may take some time to complete.

     f.  When tape is finished, you should be back at the prompt
((/pdp) piload@gemini%)).

     g.  At the next prompt, type in:

         cd tymnet (CR)       (If restoring TYMNET files)

            or

         cd tym5              (If restoring TYM5 files)

           or

         cd netload (CR)      (DO NOT ENTER AT THIS TIME)

         (DO NOT ENTER THE FOLLOWING COMMAND STRING FOR
          USERNAME NETLOAD.  CARL WILL LET ME KNOW WHEN
          IT CAN BE USED FOR THIS USERNAME)

         ls | /usr/tym/moveit | csh -x (CR)

         This may take some time to complete.

     h.  When completed and at the next prompt, type in:

         logout

     i.  At the prompt, type in:

         top (CR)

     j.  Dismount the tape and place it on the documentation table
to be held for three (3) days and then recycled.

Please contact Carl BALTRUNAS if any problems.

Thank you,


Rick

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


On June 20, I submitted a list of directories which we need to have
set up on the Sun systems for Payment Systems usage.  I have received
no notification from you as to whether these accounts have been
validated.  If they have been, then I need to know what
the hierarchial structure is and what the passwords are for
each username.  We cannot begin working on this system until we  
receive access to it.

I would appreciate it if you would let me know exactly what
accounts have been set up so that we can begin working on the Suns.
If you have any questions, please contact me at (301)840-6103.

        ================================================================   
        Summary of Changes:   
     
        o Patch to send timing dianostic to all nodes.   
     
        o Patch to handle the invalid TID properly during the new  
          normal logins.   
     
        o Modification to Patch file to compensate for inadequate  
          patch area definition in the source file. Patch file was 
          overflowing the patch area leading to a truncation of the
          patch file, resulting in exclusion of some later patches 
          from the nib file. This has been corrected.    
     
        o Patch to correct the Supervisor from sending garbage to  
          nodecode during normal login preprocessing.    
     
        o Patch to prevent sup from crashing if Null 0E msg arrives.    
        ================================================================

Philippe, (jack),
  please not the following change to my schedule'd plans today...

  please pass on to Harry ....

  1) I will not be at the fremont data center until 12 noon.  They
     had a power failure at 9pm last night and did not receive power
     again until around midnight.

  2) I talked with Joe Smith and he and I went in to help make sure the
     PDP-10s all came up ok.

  3)  I'm leaving the center as soon as I send this message.

  4)  The suns stayed up, although almost all of the network nodes in
      the center were down.

  5)  Field service laoded nearly all of the nodes... apparently this is
     because netcon didn't have information on which nodes were neighbors
     and who was responsible for loading them.

---------------

  6)  while here, I received mail from patsy dixon about the x25 changes to
      the configurations.  in any case the new slot code is too large so I
      rebuilt the nib, n00 and slot code after increasing the x25 slot sizes
      from 175 to 178.  I reladed the node... and after an unsuccessful try
      to load the slots from the sun server, reloaded both slots from the
      pdp-10s.

  7) more later.  goodnight.

IN FOLLOWING UP OUR PHONE CONVERSATION WITH JACK SNAVELY AND
CARL BALTRUNAS THIS AFTERNOON, THE FOLLOWING PROBLEM WAS
ENCOUNTERED WHEN TRYING TO GEN NODE 2041, SLOT 1,
ACOM.203 ON THE SUN SYSTEM.

WHEN GENNING WE GET AN ERROR WHEN WE REACH THE FOLLOWING
PATCH: (ASYNCPAT)ACOMTO.203.

    (asyncpat)acomto.203, line: 64 (1) error: Operand out of range
  In (asyncpat)acomto.203, line: 67 (1) error: Operand out of range

      "             "      line: 72 (1)    "       "

THIS GEN WORKS FINE ON THE PDP10'S, BUT WILL NOT GEN ON THE SUN
SYSTEM.

NODE 2041 IS SCHEDULED FOR LOADING FROM THE SUNS ON MONDAY, 7/17.

PLEASE LET THE ABOVE DISTRIBUTION KNOW WHEN OR IF THIS WILL
BE FIXED IN TIME FOR THE SCHEDULED CONVERSION.

late.  I'm really upset that your usernames did not get validated when I
had your production directories done... SInce esther and jery were both on
the system, I didn't follow up.  I'm really sorry.

  We have been experiencing some problems, mostly with source files and the
patch files referencing non-standard directories.  This is part of the "why"
I need to check with you about some of your group directories.  If I get a
chance, I will stop by and talk to jerry, since he's even on the same floor
that I'm on.

  As of "right-now" about 1/3 to 1/2 of the names on the list, mostly from
your group have been validated... you were in there twice, llet me

your group have been validated... you were in there twice, so I removed your
second occurrance and moved jolee martinex into your slot, so as not to
leave any holes.

  I have an early meeting, and will try to call you after the meeting.  Please
call cynthia hoeke, 408-922-7086 to inquire about status, also have her send
you an ontyme with the list of validated usernames, since she'd doing the
work, it'll be easier for her.

Thanks... please let me know if there are any other problems.

/carl

PS.  done't worry about backups and schedules as they stand... we do expect
     some problems in the beginning... that is why we set such an intensive
schedule, so we'd get the ball rolling... and push this project through on
time.

Subject: sun status 

due to problems with system 33, all of the user directories did NOT make it
to the suns, however, all was completed on the list through the end of cts.

on the script front, I'm still working on them...

I will make the backup.request script available as soon as I meet with Donna
and verify the information she needs to do a backup is complete.

our link is back up between boris and atlas.

i've been chasing down better sources for sna and friends... they are now
moved to the suns from system 26, but again, I have NOT had time or energy
to go in and test to see what problems do/don't exist in the new source files.

due to euske's insistance, we are getting cooperation from ntd.  I have a
meeting at 3:30 to go over our x25 configurations to verify and checkout any
potential problems we may have.

nothing else to report at this point...

sna01.r04 and pbh07.r05 have been moved into place... please have the
field re-test their slots and report back to us on any problems.

as for the async acom - the explicit patch reference to acomto.??? is now
a duplication of the patch as it has been incorporated into the released
patch file... pam says to remove it (the explicit reference) and it should
work ok.

the backup.request script is nearly complete... donna & i need more time
meeting to go over everything.

node get/put/etc  script now leaves cmd and tym files in the cs's dirs.
althgough it removeds them from pi's directories (at the moment).\


been pretty busy... will be regenning and reloading the xcom slots to the
larger window/packet size we all agree shoiuld bve used... reload will
take place tonight.

user directories except for some individual directories have been moved
to the sun... they will be moved to the individual directories sometime
today.

- g'day all.  g'night!

Subject: "Harry, Lists for directories have"... 

     
Harry,    
     
Lists for directories have been submitted for validation on the Sun systems.    
The first problem which needs to be addressed is to get all of the    
requested directories validated on the systems.  I will forward an    
Ontyme to Cynthia Hoeke to handle that situation. 
     
As I explained to Carl, Payment Systems utilizes two directories for source
code when assembling our slot files.  These two directories (DEVCODE) and  
(RELCODE) need to be in the same branch of the system as (SOURCE) and 
(BETATEST) but must be under the control of Payment Systems.  In Carl's    
last memo to me, he stated that problems had been experienced with our
directory requests involving source and patch files referencing non-standard    
directories.  I need to get together with Carl to find out what specific   
problems he is having in implementing our requests.    
     
After all directories have been established, we can then begin migration of
code over to the Sun systems.  I appreciate your assistance in getting this
problem resolved.

        The file(s) above have been modified for the following reason(s):  
     
        The following NSRs have been addressed by this release:  
.    
        2127    LU discrepancy causes crash 
        2153    XRAY NS command has headers put on wrong columns
        2156    Assembler warnings refer to unknown symbols
        2158    XRAY OH and OD commands do not check octal radix
        2162    XRAY CL command can not detect an out-of-range number
        2174    XRAY GP command does not accept five-digit host number    
        2204    XRAY NS command always has zero for its EFFICIENT field   
        2210    GGHOST@DSZT95

        2254    Patch macros should not use bells for non-error event
        2255    No gateway accounting in DISIN   
        2280    Line report assumes code size    
        2456    XRAY HS command bug for a slot   
        2495    XRAY BSZ command clobbers memory 
.    
      Changes in this version/revision may affect the memory requirement.  
.    
      Although  memory requirements remain essentially unchanged from those
      for  version  5.40,  test  generation  may  ensure  that  the  memory
      allocated in System configurations is adequate to  support  the  Node
      Code or Gateway slot.   
     
        ================================================================   
        This Code is intended for Controlled testing only and should not   
        be generally deployed.
     
        ** THIS CODE IS NOT TO BE USED WITHOUT TYMNET QA APPROVAL **  
     
        This code is now available on systems. For further Tymnet
        release date and system information, contact Quality
        Assurance.  This code will be deleted after tests are completed    
        and this function is incorporated into the baseline.

Subject: system status 

Harry,
  I mentioned this to you informally, but since Jack also wants to be kept
up-to-date, here is the current status:

1)  James & Earl are working on moving the personal directories into the
    individual users' areas.  (They began this on Friday, and expect to be
    completed sometime today).

2)  PVC code files were distributed on Friday evening.

3)  Research on the data-base for keeping track of nodes has been done and
    it will take a little more than expected to complete.  It appears that
    a program must be written to manipulate the database.  This activity is
    under way and I still expect to complete it today.

4)  X.25 slots have been regenned on the PDP-10s for four of the six systems.
    these will be reloaded sometime today (as soon as the load strings have
    been determined).  All should be able to be done as slot loads.

5)  One of the systems will have to be taken down, probably at 2 pm today
    (this will be 5pm eastern) in order to give us 2 hours to make a backup
    of the system to ship to malvern by fed ex (pickup time around 4pm).
    I will post a message on the system.
    Note:  This may be more difficult than it seems... Rick Daniels is out
    today, and I don't have a car, and someone "has to" be on site.

6)  Patch files have been moved and compared.  All modified patches and new
    patches have been installed on gemini - and distributed.

Carl,

We would like to begin moving some of our code over to the Sun systems.
When we were together, you mentioned that to move code over, we would
have to cut a tape at the Fremont data center and then have it moved
to the Sun directory.  Please send me more specific instructions as to how
we should go about moving our code over.

Thanks...Merton

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This  memo  is a notification of code released to the  Operations 
Fremont  Sun  Servers.   

This is not a typical release notice,  usually Operations will be 
receiving release notices from Tom Turner upon the QA approval of 
code  and  the release of such code to the Fremont  Sun  Servers.  

This memo is unusual due to the fact that the code being released 
to  Operations  was  believed to have been unused  and  obsolete.  
Because of it's absence,  a user of the code has been discovered.  
Therefore  this  is not a typical release of code  just  approved 
from QA but merely an update to the Operations libraries.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


The  following  code has been released to the Operations  Fremont 
Sun Servers:

Subject: sys problems 

 
	I wish to report that there are these problems in the Sun system:
 
 
   1)  If I delete the files from "Gemini", the deleted files will still exist 
       on "Titan";
 
   2)  If I create some files on "Titan", they won't show on "Gemini";
 
   3)  I am not able to use BITS to load node code on either "Gemini" nor
       "Titan", it works before;
 
   4)  The command "CP" only works if you copy files one by one, it is 
       impossible to copy a group of files from other directory to the present
       directory at one time(such as: 
 
       		> cp ../filename.* *.* 
	 
       it works before).
 
 
       When it's convenient, please let me know what happents.  Thaks.

     have  any  customers that have not upgraded to the current version in 
     
     each release level.  ( Reference  the  product  status reports in the 
     
     TECHREF directory on system 38  -  BETA.JUL , LIM.JUL , FULL.JUL  and 
     
     ALLPRD.JUL.)  You can contact me at (408) 922-7520  or  via ontyme at 
     
     NSC.T/TURNER.   This is being  done so that  the  transition from the 
     
     PDP-10  environment  to the  UNIX  environment  can  be  accomplished 
     
     easier and to insure that  old unsupportable code is not moved to the 
     
     UNIX environment.  Your help in this matter is greatly appreciated.

        ================================================================   
        The file(s) above have been released for the following reason(s):  
     
     
        TII 5.31 is released to Limited Release Status.
     
     
        Changes due to new patch:  
     
        A)   NODE CODE:    
        ---------------    
     
        A.1   Patch to make Node perform well as an ISIS switcher.    
     
        A.2   Tymfile verification of enabled proper switches.   
     
        A.3   Another fix to the line attach logic to reduce changes of a  
              line not coming up when it should come up.    
     
     
        B)   GATEWAY: 
        ------------- 
        B.1  No changes for Gateway which is still not supported in 5.31
     
        NOTE:  
        Prior release documentation incorrectly described Gateway as  
        supporting multi-based hosts.  Multi-based hosts is a feature which
        has NEVER been implemented in any version of Gateway.    
     
        C)  ISIS SUPERVISOR BASE:  
        -------------------------    
        NOTE:    
        Version 5.31 is intended for use in the following Node Code
        configurations: general Node Code and ISIS Supervisor Base.
     
        ================================================================   
        This  Code is intended for General use within Tymnet and will be   
        supported for a period of 18 months after this version is super-   
        ceeded.
     
        This code is now available on systems. For further TYMNET release  
        dates or system information please contact TYMNET PROGRAM
        MANAGEMENT. 
     
        Testing should be coordinated with SCOTT WEDEL

Subject: Mail to BRAHMB. 

The MAILER started having problems Sunday night / Monday morning when it
noticed the mail for BRAHMB had not been read for 30 days (since 22-Jul).
It attempted to return-to-sender all 737 messages, and died with a SAIL
GC error (out of string space).  Once an hour the MAILER attempted to
restart the return-to-sender, and died each time, creating a 20,000 page
temporary file.

I have copied the original file (with 737 messages) to (BRAHMB)MAIL.OLD,
its size is 1076 disk pages.  New mail should arrive OK now.

As I am "added", every time the host get's reloaded, I go away... please
have this corrected.  Apparently 1800 was reloaded, or there was a power

There were two problems.  1) Somebody deleted username OPER.  Without this
username, DSKCLN won't run.  2) Something got set wrong in the memory
controller.  This caused the terminal to beep when characters were typed
and caused "DDT" to no be recognized.  Running memory diagnostics caused
the memory controller to be reset.

The monitor requires that the following user names be valid for normal
operation:  SYS, UFD, OPER, XEXEC, SUBMIT, PERPOPER, FTSYS, MPL, SPL.

The first call came in at 11:00pm, Saturday night.  I was on the phone with them
for an hour, trying to get the system up in single user mode to check if the
LUD had been damaged.  We were unable to use the DDT command, and I think it was
due to the memory controller in the KS2020 being in an unusual state.  I had
them call in the FE to run memory diagnostics.  As I expected, the diagnostics
found nothing wrong, but they put the system back into a known state so that
DDT could be used.  The second call was at 3:00pm, Sunday afternoon.  I spent
two hours talking the FE through booting the system, bringing the KS2020 up
in single user mode, and running DSKCLN in check mode.  The DSKCLN program
found nothing wrong with the file structure, however the name "OPER" was not
a valid username on that computer.  After reloading the LSI-11 base, the
system was brought up in "KMC" mode and I was able to log in as "JMS".
After re-instating username OPER, the system came up OK.

The last call from TRW was at 12:55am this morning.  They rebooted (IPL'ed)
the system after an inexperienced operator kept switching tape drives which
caused both tape drives to be hung.  Their written procedure included typing
Control-M to get back to the KS10> prompt which was not working.  I told them
that Control-M was required to generate the FS character on their Teletype
terminal, but the ADM21 terminal they hooked up instead uses Control-\ to
generate that character.  The system was back up by 1:10am (15 minutes).

What would be a good place to start looking for the sources to (SYS)LETTER?
They're not on disk, and on F23 LETTER says BLOCK DOESNT EXIST when tryig
to add a new letter.			/Joe

         1)  NSR 002825 Add new back pressure feature for Autostatus command.
             ESC 238480    
     
         2)  NO.NSR     Add new Tymfile macro parameter to define patch area
                        sizes for PATHIS, PATCH0, and PATCH1 so RAM can use 
                        the Patch Library.    
     
         3)  NO.NSR     Move PATHIS and PATCH0 areas to end of segment 0.   
     
         4)  NO.NSR     Move PATCH1 area to end of segment 1.
     
         5)  NO.NSR     Print the reason why a Warmstart failed prior to    
                        performing a Coldstart.    
     
         6)  NSR 003046 Fix circuit building problem after Warmstart command 
             ESC 252874 so RAM sessions are written to tape.  
     
         7)  NO.NSR     Fix the Warmstart problem so it works with multimeg.
     
         8)  NO.NSR     Fix the Copyrecords problem so it copies all tapes  
                        instead of just the first tape.

              RE:  BACKSPACE KEY
 
 
 
              I log in with randerson:9752;pword.  My username is
              randerso;edi**ts.
 
              When I log into the Sun, my backspace key doesn`t
              work.  Everytime I press the backspace key,  is
              echoed back to the screen.
 
              When I log in, my terminal type is set for vt-100.
              I have used to Comm packages; Tymcomm and Crosstalk
              Mk IV.  Both of these are set for VT-100.  I last
              logged in roughly a month ago and the backspace was
              working at that time.
 
              Please fix this problem for me.

        The file(s) above have been modified for the following reason(s):  
     
         1. Nucleus sends A0/A1 message by itself for set backpressure/    
            release backpressure.  
     
         2. Reset the "UBA" bit in the CTA table to show that slot    
            "out-of-band" control has been removed.    
     
         3. Limit the amount of data/service for the input buffer.    
     
         4. Each port can only send one pack of data to oring at a time    
            in order to prevent a single port from monopolizing service 
            and causing the other ports to drop circuit from inactivity.

       12. It is not recommended to enable all of the features in one

           the code.  Even a two meg engine cannot provide the adequate    
           memory size to accommodate the code.  Please consult with

Some folks missed the original post of Apple's letter concerning the
proposed anti-discount legislation aimed at universities that
participate in Apple's (and others') university consortium
selling/pricing schemes. As a favor to the net, here it is again:
 
(original post follows:)
.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an open letter I received (secondhand) from Apple Computer. It
regards a set of proposals floating around the House of
Representatives which affect the ability of college students to
purchase computers at university prices. (This, of course, refers to
all makes of computer equipment, not just the Apple stuff.) The
recipient and I felt this might be of interest. (I am not affiliated
with Apple, nor is this posted by their request or permission.)
.
The letter follows (verbatim):
.
To: College Faculty and Students
From: Apple Computer, Inc.
Re: Federal legislation to limit your ability to buy personal computers
on college campuses
.
As you know, Apple Computer and other computer manufacturers work with
colleges and universities to conduct a special program so that you can
buy personal computers for educational purposes at large discounts
from retail price. Some businesses who sell our products at higher
prices, however, are complaining to the federal government about the
discounts made available to you through your university or college.
They would prefer you to buy computers from them at higher retail
prices. Because the Congress has been hearing only from these
businessesmen [sic] and not from the students and faculty, the
politicians are now considering ways to restrict you in the college
and university community from purchasing computers at education
prices.
.
The current proposals being considered would do the following:
.
     (1) prevent students from buying computers at education prices
from your campus reseller unless they get a permission slip from a
professor which states that the computer is required for a particular
class; and
.
     (2) prevent college faculty and staff from purchasing computers
through the campus resale program at education prices altogether.
.
Is it fair that only students who take specific classes be able to buy
computers inexpensively? Should adults be required to get a permission
slip in order to buy a computer? Will faculty members be equally
enthusiastic in using computers for class projects if their right to
buy computers on campus is taken away? At Apple, we believe the answer
to these questions is an emphatic NO. Computers are an educational
tool that you can use for many different productive and creative
purposes. Do you need a permission slip to buy a textbook, a
calculator or a typewriter? No. Then why should you need one to buy a
computer?
.
If you feel as strongly as we do that limiting the sale of computers
to college students, faculty and staff is bad public policy, you need
to let the men and women in Congress know. Your letters will have an
impact. If a Congressman gets letters from you and your colleagues or
fellow students, he will have to think twice about limiting your right
to buy computers. The follwing Congressman [sic] in the House of
Representatives are the most active on the subject:
.
     J. J. Pickle (D-TX)
     Beryl F. Anthony, Jr. (D-AR)
     Ronnie G. Flippo (D-AL)
     Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND)
     Harold E. Ford (D-TN)
     Charles B. Rangel (D-NY)
     Andrew Jacobs. Jr. (D-IN)
.
     Richard T. Schulze (R-PA)
     Raymond J. McGrath (R-NY)
     Rod Chandler (R-WA)
     E. Clay Shaw, Jr. (R-FL)
.
Please write to them at U.S. House of Representatives, Washington,
D.C. 20515. They are all members of the subcommittee which is
deliberating on this subject, the Oversight Subcommittee of the House
Ways and Means Committee. This subcommittee may make a legislative
recommendation on it very soon.
.
Since Apple is opposing this legislation, we can best coordinate our
efforts with you if you send us a copy of your letters to these
government officials. Please send the copies to:
.
     Chuck Jacob
     Apple Computer, Inc.
     1550 M St., N.W., Suite 1000
     Washington, D.C. 20005
.
If you have any questions on this issue, you can call Mr. Jacob at
(202) 872-6260. Together, we must prevent the Congress from
restricting your freedom to buy a personal computer.

              RE:  BBXS 6.02
 
 
              In preparation for the Unix migration, I have been
              attempting to gen ND2060, slot 2; a BBXS slot.
 
              I would like to know where 6.02 source code is
              located.  I used a short-cut method by calling Phil
              Sneddon and asking him where to 6.02 source code.
              Phil said to take my file and change all references
              from 6.01 to 6.02.
 
              Unfortunately, this code is not genning!  My nad
              gen error is saying that the first library file of
              my command file can not be found.  The file is
              (SOURCE)bbxs06.i02 and the error message is
              nad/nad68:  File not found.  I have tried different
              forms of letter capitalization but to no avail.
 
              My userid on the Sun is randerso and I am homed to
              Titan, under acs directory.

        A.1 
        Changed some Load Immediate instructions into Load Address 
        instructions in order to avoid Turbo translation errors. 
        See labels: DATM10 and BFR030.    
        (NSR: none. Internal testing)
     
        A.2 
        Fixed PVC logic to properly update the AELCNT counter 
        (Active External Port Count per line). 
        See labels: IDONE3, IZAP33.  
        (NSR: none. Internal testing)
     
        A.3 
        The message pointer needed by the routine RESETP has been  
        properly set up. See labels: PSUB8, RTD182, RTD187, RTD340.
        (NSR: none. Mercury testing) 
     
        A.4 
        Fixed contention conditions background/foreground caused by the 
        fact that the link layer receiver and the link layer transmitter
        have been separated. See new handling of FGLOCK. 
        In version 5.06 there were two locks: FGLOCK and TXLOCK; starting    
        with version 5.07, there will be a unique lock: FGLOCK.    
        (NSR: none. Mercury testing) 
     
        A.5 
        Changed several RX3 instructions into RX1 instructions.    
        See labels: LIM200, DATAMS.  
     
        A.6 
        Decreased the Addenda Accounting Message report rate. 
        Starting from version 5.07 each port gets reported every   
        32 minutes (the report time period was 16 in the previous  
        version).
        See labels: T64S, INI139.
