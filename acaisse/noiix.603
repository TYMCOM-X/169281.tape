: Patch name: NOIIX.603              Product and Version: ISCS 6.03
:     Author: JCR                           Organization: STS
:   Customer: PUBLIC CONSATS                Date Written: 5/5/88
: Description of Problem:  		  	 Updated: 11/28/88
:
:	This is a copy of (QSATS)ISCS06.PAS which was written to
:	disable request for IIX-capable circuit in PNR. That one
:	made it necessary to SETFLAG(NOIIX,ON) unless Outdial was
:	included while this one ALWAYS disbales IIX unless PAD or
:	Telex is included. Although the original problem of sending
:	data to X.25 before IIX negotiation is complete has been
:	corrected in ISCS 6.03, many Public Net X.25's have patches
:	which clear or hang calls with IIX bit set.
:
:	This patch updated 11/28/88 to incorporate (ASYNCPAT)STAT.603
:	which disabled request for extended logon status, but was in
:	conflict with original NOIIX.603 in that they both patched
:	the same area. We assume that we ALWAYS want to disable re-
:	quest for ELS since failure to do so causes erroneous circuit
:	failure messages in some case.
:
:	To disable IIX and ELS, use NOIIX.603.
:	To disable ELS only, use STAT.603.
