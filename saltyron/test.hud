1.  FILES
---------

READ.TXT      This file provides general information on THESYS.

TYMCOMM.COM   This is a modified TYMCOMM that enables you to run TYMCOMM if
              you are using COMM 1 at 9600 baud.  This modified version  of
              TYMCOMM 4.1.1 is the only  one that will support THESYS.   To
              run this program, type "TYMCOMM" <return> at the C:/ prompt.


2.  LOADING TYMCOMM ONTO YOUR PC
--------------------------------

    In order to use THESYS, you  MUST USE THIS MODIFIED VERSION OF  TYMCOMM
    4.1.1.   This  version  has  been  modified  to  support  THESYS  while
    maintaining  all  the  features  available  on  the original version of
    TYMCOMM 4.1.1.

    Copy this disk's version of  TYMCOMM.COM onto your PC.  If  you already
    have a version of TYMCOMM  named "TYMCOMM.COM", rename YOUR version  to
    "TYMCOMM.OLD".

    Log into TYMCOMM by typing "TYMCOMM" <return> at the C:\ prompt.

    If you have not set your password, follow the instructions in Part 3.

    For THESYS applications and instructions, see Part 4.


3.  SETTING YOUR PASSWORD
-------------------------

You will need  to set your  password for your  username on time  accounting
upon  your  initial  entry  into  THESYS  and periodically thereafter.  The
following instructions are provided to accomplish this:

  A.  Establish  your  network  connection  via  the  version  of   TymCOMM
      installed by NTD Program Management.  TIME ACCOUNTING WILL NOT RUN ON
      ANY OTHER VERSION.

  B.  Upon  "please  log  in:"  Type:  Control-R,  Control-C,  and the word
      "THESYS"  <return>.
 
  C.  Upon "Username:" Type in YOUR username <return>.

      IF YOU ARE UNSURE OF YOUR  USERNAME, CALL ME AT 408/922-6746.

      YOU HAVE 5 ATTEMPTS TO SUCCESSFULLY  LOG IN.  If you receive a  "user
      authorization failure" message, you have made an unsuccessful attempt
      to log in, hit  the <return> key to  get a second "username"  prompt.
      You have 20 seconds between login attempts before the host drops your
      circuit.  AFTER 5  UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT  LOGGING IN, YOU  WILL BE
      LOCKED OUT OF THE SYSTEM FOR SOME TIME.

  D.  Upon "Password:"  Type in  YOUR password  <return>.  If  you have set
      your password already, go to step 3F.

      IF THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE LOGGING INTO THESYS, YOUR  PASSWORD
      IS "CHANGE_ME" WHERE THE "_" SIGN IS THE "UNDERSCORE" CHARACTER.

  E.  To  set  your  password,  at  the  "$"  prompt,  type  "set password"
      <return>.

      Upon "Old password:" prompt, type in your present password  <return>.
      (eg. change_me)

      Upon "New password:" prompt, type in YOUR NEW password.

      NOTE: YOUR PASSWORD MUST BE AT LEAST 6 CHARACTERS LONG.  YOU MAY  USE
      ALPHABETIC, NUMERIC, THE "$"  SIGN AND THE UNDERSCORE  "_" CHARACTERS
      ONLY.   I  RECOMMEND  YOU  EMBED  AT  LEAST  ONE  NUMERIC, "$" OR "_"
      CHARACTER IN YOUR PASSWORD FOR INCREASED SECURITY.

                           Examples:  pass_word
                                      time$acctg
                                      tym4acctg

      Upon  "Verification:"  prompt,  type  in  YOUR  NEW  password   AGAIN
      <return>.

      You have now established your  new password.  Use this password  with
      your username whenever logging onto the THESYS.

      * For  more information  on "Set  password" command,  type "help  set
      password" at the  "$" prompt.  To  get out of  help command, use  the
      <return> key.

  F.  To enter time accounting, at the "$" prompt, type "THESYS" <return>.

  G.  To log-off of time accounting:

      If you are at a highlighted prompt,  hit F10 key.  If you are at  any
      other prompt,  type "log".   Wait for  the "please  log in" prompt to
      come up and then hit "control-break" to exit to your PC prompt.
 

4.  LOGGING IN
--------------

  A.  Establish your network connection via TYMCOMM.
  B.  Upon "please log in:"  Type: Control-R, Control-C, THESYS
      <return>.
  C.  Type in your username <return>.
  D.  Type in your password <return>.
  E.  You are now in VAX/VMS operating system.
