                               Q.A. Testing


    1.0 Introduction

       1.1 Document Purpose

          This document is written to present a  formal  understanding  of
          the  role of the Q.A.  Support in the release of TYMNET products
          to the Customer of  TYMNET.   It  is  designed  to  specify  the
          requirements  and  the  limitations of Q.A.  Support to exercise
          new or re-released products.

          This document will clarify the activities of Q.A.  Testing as  a
          service to developers.

          The document, when accepted, will be a policy statement  on  the
          activities of Q.A.  Testing in future releases of new or revised
          products.  It is also a policy  statement  as  to  the  expected
          activities of the Q.A.  Testing support function.


       1.2 Q.A.  Testing Overview

          Q.A.  Testing will be a combination  of  hardware  and  software
          tools  and  of support personnel that will perform Certification
          testing on NTD released products.  The testing will be developed
          to give a rapid but thorough examination of the released product
          to verify conformation to specification and relative  performace
          statistics.

          The testing support is designed into two levels:

             * Phase I  in  which  a  basic  Certification  test  will  be
             performed  and  the  test  plus  the  results returned to the
             requestor within 24 hours.

             * Phase II in which additional tests beyond certification are
             performed to confirm accounting records, loading performance,
             and other conditions that might give a measure of performance
             in  user  community.  Because of the need for data reduction,
             this test will be designed to complete within 3 days.

          The testing performed will attempt to prove all functionality as
          specified  in  the  specification.  Tests will be performed in a
          controlled environment and under conditions that  allow  for  no
          unexpected  outside  interferance.  The tests must be repeatable
          and lend themselves to automated post-test analysis.

          Testing will attempt  to  prove  functionality;   will  look  at
          responses  to bad input data;  and will look at inopportune data
          arrival conditions.
                                                                    Page 4


       1.3 Q.A.  Testing Support

          Q.A.  testing is currently under development in that a  research
          program  is  under  way to find out how some of the NTD products
          are currently being tested.  This activity involves two  people.
          The  results  of  their  efforts will used to create the testing
          environment for the automated portion of the testing function.

          The creation of a test environment is the responsibility of  one
          individual  and  will  be mostly in place by the end of December
          1985.  The environment will be called ATF and  will  attempt  to
          test nearly all of the NTD products that are based on the Engine
          technology.


       1.4 Q.A.  Testing Activities

          * Incorporation of test senarioes into the test environment.

          * Research into products needing to be tested.

          * The physical connection of hardware into the test environment.

          * ATF monitoring and problem correction.

          * Test councelling.

                                                                    Page 5


                               Q.A> Testing


    2.0 Testing

       2.1 Testing Purpose

          What is the purpose of testing;  why is testing necessary;   and
          who  has  the  responsibility  for  testing are normal questions
          during the development  cycle.   I  would  like  to  present  my
          opinions:

             * The purpose of testing is to detect  flaws  that  may  have
             been  overlooked  during  development.   The developer is not
             always capable of seeing problems due to being too  close  to
             the product.  This also includes flaws that are re-introduced
             into the product by fixing another area of the code.

             * There may be configurations that cannot  be  found  in  the
             developers arena.

             * Large volumes of data are not easily verified by developers
             due to the lack of productive time.

             * Why testing is necessary  comes  down  to  the  concept  of
             professionalism.   Customers want a perception of performance
             confirmed during testing.



             * TESTING is NOT a QUALITY assurance function.   The  quality
             goes in before testing begins.




             * The responsibility for testing is defined within  the  test
             plan.   Structured  analysis  can sometimes catch the obvious
             and sometimes catch some of the problems at the  extremes  of
             the design.


       2.2 Q.A.  Testing Role

          Q.A.  Testing will provide, where appropriate,  a  Certification
          environment  that  will  be  a  sufficient exercise to measure a
          product's   compliance   to   specifications.    The    expected
          measurements will be recorded over the scheduled test period.

          In order to provide for a test enviroment,  Q.A.   Testing  will
          configure  the  Q.A.  network so that a test environment will be
          available at test time.

                                                                    Page 6


       2.3 Test Acceptance

          Q.A.  Testing will accept products that  are  contained  in  the
          testing  library  of  the Q.A.  Unit.  The other aspects of Q.A.
          verification will take place within the Q.A.  Unit.  These other
          items pertain to the documentation requirements.

          Testing will normally not be scheduled in that it will  complete
          3  days  after  submission  by  the  development  groups.  It is
          therefore not reasonable to place this milestone on  a  definite
          schedule.

          Acceptance of  a  product  for  testing  by  the  Q.A.   Testing
          function will be dependent on the completion of the testing plan
          and the subsequent test plan senarioes.   These  items  will  be
          provided  by the Q.A.  Unit and will be expected to be delivered
          prior to the product delivery
                                                                    Page 7


                               Q.A. Testing


    3.0 Test Posture


       3.1 Pre-work and acceptance

          Q.A.  Testing Support will  review  the  test  requirements  for
          product   test   and   will  determine  its  capacity  for  test
          performance.  The outline of what  will  be  actually  attempted
          will be accepted by the Developers and a tentative time schedule
          will be agreed to in writing with respect to test start.


       3.2 Test Activities

          Results of the tests  will  be  compiled  and  shared  with  the
          developers.    Since  the  test  environment  is  to  be  mostly
          automated,  only  the  test  result   report   compilation   and
          distribution is required.

       3.3 Test Write ups

          A formal report  will  accompany  each  Phase  II  test.   These
          reports  will  be submitted to management and the Project leader
          or manager for the product under test.

       3.4 Post Test Activities

          Q.A.  Testing will maintain a database  of  product  performance
          statistics  that  will be made available to product managers and
          developers.
