   SYNOPSIS

           Simple file transfer protocol slave program.

   SYNTAX

           R (SPL)SFTP

   DESCRIPTION

           Invokes  a  slave  process  to  handle  simple   file  transfers.
           Transfers are restricted to text files.  There is no  checksum or
           retransmission protocol to detect  or recover from errors,  it is
           assumed this function is provided by the network.

           Commands  consist  of a  four  character command  followed  by an
           optional  argument  followed  by  end-of-line.   The  end-of-line
           convention used to terminate commands determines  the end-of-line
           used in data transfer.

           The slave will answer with the welcome message:
                   220 SFTP server v?? ready.

           The following commands may then be sent to the slave:

           HELO master-system-name

                   This command is optional and merely  provides information
                   for  file  creation and  any  logs that  may  be  kept in
                   future.  Possible responses are:
                           250 okay

           READ filename

                   This command reads a file from the slave system.   If the
                   file is successfully opened, a response
                           252 File data follows
                   is sent followed by
                           <cr><lf><file><^d><cr><lf>
                   In the body, <file>, the character <^d> is sent twice for
                   each real occurance  to eliminate confusion with  the end
                   of file sequence.  The possible failure responses are:
                           450 File being modified: file-name
                           501 Illegal file name: file-name
                           550 File not found: file-name
                           550 No such user: file-name
                           550 File protected: file-name
                           554 File selection error code 'octal-integer
                   Also, the non-fatal error message:
                           211-Block mode not available
                   may precede the 252 message in cases where the network is
                   temporarily out of block  IO buffers.  After the  file is
                   transfered, the final status is reported if successful:

                   If  the  READ  command  is  terminated  by  <CR><LF>,  no
                   translation occurs.  If the command is terminated by only
                   <LF>, all  occurances of <CR><LF>  in the  file (Tymcom-X
                   end-of-line) are translated to <LF> when sent  (Unix end-
                   of-line).   The end  of file  mark,  <^d><CR><LF>, always
                   contains  <CR>.  In  all cases,  SFTP will  remove PDP-10
                   style  line  numbers  (as left  by  the  SOS  editor) and
                   embedded and trailing nulls.

           WRIT filename

                   This commands accepts a  file to be written on  the slave
                   system.  If the file is successfully opened, a response
                           354 Start file input; end with <eot><crlf>
                   is sent.  The master should then send the contents of the
                   file  using the  same escape  mechanism  described above.
                   After  the end  of file,  <^d><cr><lf>, is  received, the
                   following message will be  sent if the file  transfer was
                   successful:
                           250 file-name decimal-integer chars
                   Or if unsuccessful, one of the error messages:
                           451 Black ball received - data lost
                           451 IO.DER Device error for DSK:file-name

                           552 IO.BKT Disk full or quota exceeded
                   The following errors are possible in response to the WRIT
                   command:
                           450 File being modified: file-name
                           452 Disk full or quota exceeded
                           501 Illegal file name: file-name

                           554 File selection error code 'octal-integer
                   In addition, the  following advisory message  may precede
                   the 354 message  in response to  the WRIT command  in the
                   event  the  network  is unable  to  provide  a  block I/O
                   buffer, resulting in a less efficient transfer:
                           211-Block mode not available
                   The following errors are possible in response to  the end
                   of file <^d><cr><lf>:
                           451 Black ball received - data lost

                   A <CR> preceding a  <LF> is optional, and if  absent will
                   be provided by the program to meet  Tymcom-X conventions.
                   In block mode input (if available), there will be a 15-20
                   second delay  after sending the  end of file  mark before
                   the system responds.

           NOOP

                   Response is
                           250 okay

           HELP

                   Response is
                           214-Commands implemented:
                           214 HELO, READ file, WRIT file, NOOP, HELP, QUIT

           QUIT

                   Response is
                           221 Service closing transmission channel
                   followed by LOGOFF.

           STOP

                   This command is typically used for debugging.   It causes
                   the  server  program  to  immediately  terminate  without
                   logging out.

           All  messages  from  the  SFTP  slave  will  be  terminated  with
           <cr><lf>.  Commands and data are not echoed.

           It is very important that the master program properly process any
           error messages that may  be created.  In most cases,  this simply
           means reporting them  to the user  and terminating.  In  order to
           test error processing, the following otherwise illegal file names
           may be specified with the  READ or WRIT commands to  simulate the
           error conditions indicated:
                   .0      file not found
                   .1      user not found
                   .2      file protected
                   .3      file being modified
                   .8      illegal file name
                   .12     disk full or quota exceeded
                   .17     unknown file selection error
                   .18     unknown IO error
                   .19     device IO error
                   .20     data IO error
                   .21     disk full or quota exceeded
                   .31     black ball
           Each of these conditions should be tested to make sure the master
           program  responds properly.   Errors 0-17  are detected  when the

           file  is  opened and  prevent  the data  transfer  from starting.
           Errors 18-35 are detected in the process of transfering data.  In
           a READ, these errors cause the data transfer to stop and  an EOT-
           CR-LF sequence to  be sent followed by  the error message.   In a
           WRIT, these errors do  not interrupt the data transfer,  but wait
           for  the  EOT-CR-LF  to  be  received  from  the   master  before
           outputting the error message.
