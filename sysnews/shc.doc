     The following is the functional specification for SHC, a program to
supplement  BCHARG in  the processing  and charging  of Batch  and Spool
requests.

     SHC is to be run by the same operator who runs BCHARG in performing
the bulk of Batch and Spool request processing.  It is intended to  be a
makeshift  means  of  levying  SHIPPING  and  RECEIVING   charges  which
heretofore had either gone unassessed, or been erroneously added  to the
postage charges in BCHARG.

     To simplify operating procedures,  it is possible to  apply postage
charges along  with special  handling charges  using SHC,  obviating the
need to re-run  BCHARG to do so.   This will take the  affected requests
out of "HOLD" status, just as running BCHARG would.

     When the operator runs  SHC, he or she  is prompted for his  or her
oper name and password, and then for data identifying the  request(s) to
be charged, as well as the nature of the charges.

     The  commands  which the  operator  can enter  in  response  to the
"Request(s)" prompt are as follows:


     nnnnn             A specific request number, for which SHC searches
                       first the holding  file, and then  the completion
                       file(1).

                       This  is  the  command  normally  used  to charge
                       individual requests.  SHC will prompt for postage
                       charges  when  it  picks  up  a  record  from the
                       holding  file,  presuming  that  both   types  of
                       charges will be known at the time SHC is run.  In
                       this  event,  SHC  will  complete   the  request,
                       eliminating the need to re-run BCHARG to do so.

     CHANGE nnnnn      Alters special  handling charges  already applied
                       to the named request.  It will be used  mainly to
                       clean up  requests for which  one or more  of the
                       charges  (SHIPPING,  RECEIVING,  or  POSTAGE) was
                       incorrect.

     HELP or           Prints a summary of this list of options.
     ?

     QUIT              Exits SHC to exec level.

---------------
     (1) When BCHARG  is run,  if the  "HOLD" response  is given  to the
"POSTAGE" prompt, the request in question is placed in the holding file,
PARCHG.DAT,  to  await   the  application  of  delivery   charges.   The
completion  file  is BATsss.mmm  (where  "sss" is  a  three-digit system
number, and "mmm" a three-character name for the current month).

     STATUS nnnnn      Print the completion status of the named request.
                       This consists of  a brief summary of  each record
                       on file pertinent to the named request.

                       This command  is for  use occasionally,  when the
                       paperwork describing the history of a particiular
                       request has been lost or mangled, and a  recap is
                       is needed.

     UNPROCESSED       Charges all requests in the holding file.

implementation  of  special handling  charges.   They are  job  types 14
(SHIPPING)  and  15  (RECEIVING).   The  following  diagrams  detail the
formats for these accounting records.  As usual, words 0 through  10 are
header information, identical for all job types, while words  11 through
16 are particular to each job type.
