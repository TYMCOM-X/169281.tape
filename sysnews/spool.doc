THIS REFLECTS VERSION 6.00 OF SPOOL

     This manual is a companion to the SPOOL USER'S  MANUAL,
and   supplements  the  information   in  that  manual  (see
(*6NEWS)SPOOL.DOC). The information in this manual describes
the  operation of remote printers  for  SPOOL  and  commands
associated   with   printing  remote  requests.   The remote
printers supported by SPOOL are CDC, 2780, Data Products (DP)
and Vogue.

     In addition to the commands  described  in  the  USER'S
MANUAL,  additional  commands  are  available  to designated
people to print spooled requests.  In order to access  these
commands,   license  must  be  set  using  the  SET  command
described below.   The  SET  command  should  be  the  first
command issued after entering the SPOOL system.


                      Status Commands

     The Status commands (STATUS, REPORT, and LIST)  may  be
executed  by  operators.  Operators receive information only
for their printer location and their district.  In addition,
when operators execute one of the above commands, additional
information is provided.  Two additional  status  words  can
appear in the status line.

  HOLD  The request has been placed on HOLD by an operator.
  TRAN  The request is in a transfer state and needs to be
        transfered by the operator to a different
        printing site.

     If  there  are  any  requests  to  be  transfered,  the
operator  will  be reminded of this fact before each command
is  processed  and  until  all  the   requests   have   been
transfered.

     Information concerning the type of paper and number  of
pages  is  also  given  for  the  STATUS,  REPORT  and  LIST
commands.  The number of pages that the operator sees is the
least  number of pages required to complete the request, not
the number of pages that will be charged.

     Also, if a request requires a full character set (upper
and  lower)  printer,  it will be flaged as "FC".  This will
appear after the type of paper required for the request.


     When a request is printed, the  accounting  information
is  written  to  one of two places.  If there is no delivery
charge, the information is written  directly  to  accounting
and  no  further  action is required.  If there are delivery
charges the information is held so that the operator may add
the  charge.   Remote  operators  use  the  program 1RCHARGE
                                                      Page 2


(TYMCOM-IX) or RCHARG (TYMCOM-X) to  complete the request.

     The hardcopy  for the request will  tell you if RCHARG
or 1RCHARGE needs to be run.  If the  hardcopy  says  RCHARG
must  be run  against the  request, it  must be done even if 
there is no delivery  charge so that the accounting  records
will  be  completed  for the  printing.  In such  a case the
request  should  be charged  off with  .00  entered  for the 
delivery charge.
                                                      Page 3


                       PRINT Command

     There are four options for this command which can  only
be used by operators.  This command does the printing of the
spooled files on the printer.  When  the  request  has  been
completed,  a  hardcopy is produced for the request.  At the
onset of the first PRINT command issued, the  operator  will
be  asked if his printer has a full character set (upper and
lower).  If the reply is "NO", only those requests which  do
not specify the FULLCH option when spooling will be printed.
Should any of those requests  have  lower  case  characters,
they  will  be converted to upper case before being printed.
If the printer does not have a full character set,  requests
that  require  it  (via the FULLCH option) can be printed by
the  PRINT  <number>  command.   Those  requests   will   be
converted  to  upper  case  before being printed.  The print
options available are detailed below.  After the first print
command  is  issued,  the operator will be asked what remote
printer is being used.  The operator  must  respond  with  a
valid printer name.

PRINT [ALL]

     This command will sort all pending requests  (PEND)  by
type  of  form and number of parts before printing.  If only
one type of form is needed for printing, the  operator  will
be  told  to  mount  that  type  of  form  on  the  printer.
Otherwise, if several different types of forms are needed, a
summary  of  the  forms  is printed and the operator will be
asked which type of form he wishes to print.   All  requests
for  the  form  specified  will  be  printed and the process
repeated until all requests for all forms are completed.


PRINT FORM

     This command is used for printing all pending  requests
for  one  type of form.  The system will prompt the operator
for the type of form desired, tell him how  many  pages  are
required, and then print all pending requests for that form.


                                                      Page 4


PRINT <number>

     This will print only the  request  specified.   If  the
request  is  anything  but  PEND or HOLD, confirmation as to
whether the request is to be redone  is  required.   If  the
printer  has been flaged as not a full character set printer
and the request requires it, the operator will be  asked  if
he  wants to print it.  If so, the request will be converted
to upper case before  being  printed.   The  type  of  paper
required   is   then   typed   and  the  program  waits  for
confirmation of the forms on the printer.   The  request  is
then printed.

     This is the only command which will print a job on HOLD
status.    In   the  event  that  multiple  forms  paper  is
unavailable, the request may be redone multiple  times,  and
only one charge is recorded in the accounting.

     Due to the possibility that  a  user  may  specify  the
wrong  print  switches  when  he  makes  a  spool request, a
feature has been included for the operator to  override  the
user's print switches.

     On the PRINT <number> and  RESTART  <number>  commands,
the  operator  will  be asked OPTIONS:.  This is effectively
asking the operator  what  print  switches  to  use  on  the
request.   The  operator  may  specify the use of the user's
original switches by a carriage  return,  or  he  may  enter
switches   which   will  override  only  those  switches  he
specifies.  Switches available are:  HEAD,  NOHEAD,  SINGLE,
DOUBLE, FORTRAN (TYMCOM-X), NOFORTRAN (TYMCOM-X) and LINES=.



PRINT <number> Filename

     This command is used to print an individual file  of  a
request.   The file is printed in its entirety and only once
regardless of how  many  copies  the  requester  wants.   No
accounting record is created.

                      RESTART Command

     The RESTART command is used to restart a  request  that
has  been  only partially completed.  The system will prompt
for the request number, file name, restart copy  number  and
restart  page  number.  The copy number can be obtained from
the last file title page  of  the  file  in  question.   The
restart page number is the physical page to restart printing
on.  Page numbers on the listing cannot be relied upon as  a
correct  indicator  as a restart printing point in the file.
A carriage return indicates to begin printing at  the  start
of  the  file.   When  the  file is found, SPOOL proceeds to
print that file and all succeeding files for the request.

                        HOLD Command

     This is a  utility  command  which  is  used  to  place
individual  requests on hold, such as when there is no paper
for the request.  Once a request is on HOLD status, it shows
up  as PEND on user STATUS commands, but are not included in
the ALL commands for PRINT.  The only way that requests  may
be taken off HOLD status is to be printed by the operator or
canceled by the user or the operator.

                       CANCEL Command

     Since users can only cancel requests which are  pending
or  on  hold,  it  is  necessary  to allow someone to cancel
requests which are in other status states.   Therefore,  the
operator   can  cancel  anyone's  request  regardless  of  a
request's status.
                       DELETE Command

     This command is for deleting a file from a request  and
should  only  be  used  when  a file cannot be printed, i.e.
file is bad or binary.

                      TRANSFER Command

     A request goes into transfer status when the  requester
indicates  he wants his request printed at a different site.
This command must be used against any request that has  TRAN
status.   The  TRANSFER command is the only operator command
which can be used against a request which  in  TRAN  status.
The  TRANSFER  command  will  move  the  request to the site
desired with the operators assistance.   When  the  operator
issues  a  transfer  command  against the request, the SPOOL
system will tell him the location to  transfer  the  request
to.   The  operator  will enter a node number and an address
will  be  typed  out   that   must   be   confirmed.    Upon
confirmation,  the  request will now belong to the new site.
In place of a node number, the word "CENTER" may be used, in
which case, the request will be moved to the computer center
for printing.

                      TRANSFER Command

     In  order  to  determine  which  requests  need  to  be
transfered, the operator should issue the STATUS command.

     In order to get  the  node  numbers  for  the  TRANSFER
command,  the  operator  should  log into the IMS system and
call 1PNUPD.  The command PPA will give a complete  list  of
printer location addresses and the associated nodes.



                      HARDCOPY Command

     This command will ask  the  operator  for  the  request
number  and  the requester name.  All information entered by
the requester at the time of spooling will be typed  out  on
the operator's terminal.



                        SET Command

     This command is used by potential remote operators.  It
will ask for your license username and license password.  If
the user has Remote Print ability, the user will be  flagged
as  a remote operator.  This command should be issued before
the remote operator issues a STATUS, REPORT or LIST  command
as  it  will allow the operator to see the pages and type of
paper needed with each request.

       NOTIFICATION OF REQUESTS WAITING TO BE PRINTED

     In order for the remote operators to find out  if  they
have  any pending requests to be printed at their site, they
must log into the IMS system and while at  the  EXEC  level,
issue  the  command  1NOTIFY.   This program will respond by
listing all systems that  have  pending  requests  for  that
site.

          (Revised to reflect Version 7 /16-Aug-82)

                   TRANSPORTATION CHARGES

     Since we are unable to determine transportation charges
(postage  charges  or  courier  service  charges)  until the
listing is complete and ready to be sent,  charges  must  be
entered  by the operator.  The program used to enter charges
is RCHARG on the TYMCOM-X and 1RCHARGE  on  the  TYMCOM-IX.
RCHARG  is to be run by the office printing remote requests
for those  requests  which  are  not  designated  as  pickup
requests.

     To run the program the operator types

R RCHARG on TYMCOM-X systems

1RCHARGE on TYMCOM-IX systems

     Operation of the  two  programs  is  nearly  identical.
RCHARG  requires  SP  licence  to be  set  from  within  the
program.   RCHARG  will ask for the  user name and password.

    RCHARG prints the date and time as in this example:
