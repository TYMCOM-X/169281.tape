                              SUMMARY OF CHANGES                              _______ __ _______

            Updated COMMAND SUMMARY of ONCE Dialogue.

            Updated COMMAND SUMMARY of FILES Subsection in ONCE.

            Updated COMMAND SUMMARY of PACKCOPY.

            Reformatted entire document.   All  3330  procedures  are  together
       (Part  I).   All  3652  procedures  are together (Part II), and all 3650
       procedures are together (Part III).

            Replaced all referencing to the RENAMING of (SYS)XEXEC.SAV  to  use
       of the command NOINITIA when rebuilding with ALL-FILES.

            The ASP and ADDING packs procedures are now valid for all Systems.

            Added APPENDIX I to use when rebuilding and entering the  NAMES  OF
       PHYSICAL UNITS.


                                         NOTE

           Until TITO is changed to automatically give files  their  proper
           license,  (or  until  Managers  are given "QM" license) Software
           Support will need to be notified to give the following file  its
           proper  license  for  it  to  run  properly  after  an ALL-FILES
           restore:

ONCE DESCRIPTION


                            "ONCE" ON THE TYMCOM-X                            ______ __ ___ ________

       DESCRIPTION       ___________

            When the system is loaded, the name of the monitor and time of  its
       creation  will  be  typed as they are now.  If sense switch 4 is not on,
       the system will begin auto-reload procedure.

            The system will not ask for the time and date to be  typed  in,  it
       will try to get them from the supervisor.  Failing this, it will request
       the first person to log in to give the time and date.

            The auto-restart sequence  will  consist  of  running  DSKCLN.   If
       DSKCLN  encounters  no  major  errors  (See  MM#5  on  DSKCLN  for error
       typeout).  Copycrash will be run.  This program will copy the crash file
       if one is present and output a message to this effect.  CHKPNT will also
       be started automatically.  (See MM#3 on CHKPNT).  When these things have
       been  done,  an  automatic schedule of 0, 400000, or 100000 will be done
       depending on conditions (See MM#2 on INITIIALIZATION and COPYCRASH)).

            When the system is initially loaded, if sense switch 4 is  on,  the
       system  will enter the "ONCE" dialogue.  The "ONCE" dialogue will prompt
       with "ONCE>" and wait for commands.

       ENTERING FILES DIALOGUE       ________ _____ ________

            The files dialogue is used to examine and change parameters of  the
       disk system.  There are two ways in which the files dialogue is entered.
       The first way is for the Operator to set sense switch  4  and  give  the
       command "FILES" when the prompt "ONCE>" is typed.

            The other method in which the files dialogue is  entered  is  as  a
       result of errors detected in the "HOME" blocks on the disk as the system
       is  brought  up.   The  "HOME"  blocks  store  information   about   the
       configuration of the disk system.

            There are "THREE" classes  of  errors  which  may  be  detected  on
       bringing up the system.  The "FIRST" class is extremely minor (I.  E., a
       unit off-line) and the system will just print a message telling  of  the
       condition.   The  "SECOND"  class  contains  those errors which may need
       fixing, but which the system can "LIVE WITH".  These are errors such  as
       the disk being off-line.  This class of errors results in the question:

       MINOR ERRORS - BRING SYSTEM UP ANYWAY?

            A POSITIVE answer will result  in  the  system  being  started.   A
       NEGATIVE answer will cause the message:

       ENTERING FILES DIALOGUE...
         TYPE "GO" TO RETURN TO ONCE.

            and the "FILES" will be started.
                                                                         Page 6
ONCE DESCRIPTION


            The "THIRD" class of errors are those  which  the  system  can  not
       accept  (I.  E., part of a File Structure missing).  This results in the
       message:

       ERRORS WHICH PREVENT BRINGING SYSTEM UP
       ENTERING FILES DIALOGUE...

         TYPE "GO" TO RETURN TO ONCE.

       LEAVING FILES DIALOGUE       _______ _____ ________

            The "GO" command at the "FILES*" prompt indicates that  the  "FILES
       dialogue"  is  to  be  terminated.   Entering "GO" at the "ONCE>" prompt
       indicates that the "ONCE" dialogue is to be terminated  and  the  system
       brought  up.   It  will  always  be the last command given to the "ONCE"
       dialogue.

            When the system is brought up with the "ONCE" dialogue and  a  unit
       has bad "BAT" blocks, the following will be asked:

       DO YOU WANT TO INITIALIZE THE BAT BLOCKS ON THIS UNIT?

            A POSITIVE ANSWER WILL RESULT IN

       NOT NORMALLY DONE, ARE YOU SURE?

            A positive answer to this question also will result  in  the  "BAT"
       blocks  being  rewritten  to indicate that there are no bad spots on the
       unit.

       ONCE DIALOGUE ERROR MESSAGES       ____ ________ _____ ________

            The following is a list of errors which may output:

       BP# IS OFF-LINE
       DO YOU WANT IT TO BE 1)ON-LINE, OR 2)DOWN?  (TYPE #)

            (The message may say BPB, BPC, or BPD instead of BPA.  This message
       indicates  that  the controller is OFF-LINE (turned off, in local, etc.)
       If it should be OFF-LINE (for example, if  the  disk  is  sick  and  the
       controller  turned  off)  the  Operator  should  type  #2  (CR).  If the
       controller should not be OFF-LINE, turn it ON-LINE  and  type  #1  (CR).
       The  controller  will  then  be  checked again to make sure it is really
       ON-LINE.
                                                                         Page 7
ONCE DESCRIPTION


            # = A, B, C, D, ETC

            %% = 0, 1, 2, ETC

       BP#(%%) IS OFF-LINE

            One of the units is OFF-LINE.  This may be  an  expected  condition
       and  the  system will try to come up anyway.  (The unit might be a spare
       drive which is turned off).

       BP#(%%) IS WRITE PROTECTED
       DO YOU WANT IT TO BE 1)WRITE-ENABLED, OR 2)WRITE-PROTECTED? (TYPE #)

            This is much like the controller OFF-LINE  message.   It  is  never
       normal for a unit to be ON-LINE and WRITE-PROTECTED.  

       BP#(%%) FIRST HOM BLOCK HARDWARE READ ERROR
       BP#(%%) SECOND HOM BLOCK HARDWARE READ ERROR
       BP#(%%) FIRST HOM BLOCK CONSISTENCY ERROR
       BP#(%%) SECOND HOM BLOCK CONSISTENCY ERROR

            These are all errors detected while trying to read the home blocks.
       Each  unit  has  two  copies of its home blocks.  Unless both blocks are
       bad, the good block will be  used.   In  this  case  simply  report  the
       problem  to  TYMCOM-10 Systems Support Service.  If both blocks are bad,
       the system will assume that the unit is not in a file  structure.   This
       may  also  lead to other error messages which will cause you to need the
       ONCE dialogue, but in itself is considered a minor error.  

       MORE THAN ONE LAST UNIT IN STR DSKB

       MORE THAN ONE UNIT WAS FOUND IN FILE STRUCTURE.  THIS ERROR  FORCES  THE
       ONCE DIALOGUE.  

       LAST UNIT WASN'T FOUND IN STR DSKB
       TWO LOGICAL UNIT 4'S FOUND IN STR DSKB
       LOGICAL UNIT #1 MISSING FROM STR DSKB

            All of the above errors force the ONCE dialogue.  They are  usually
       caused  by  having  the  wrong  set of disks on-line (such as the System
       Packs and a CE pack on-line at the same time).  

       ?NO STR'S IN "SYS" SEARCH LIST

            The "SYS" search list indicates which STR'S to use when  trying  to
       access  "SYS"  (I.   E.,  The R command or when logging in).  This error
       forces the ONCE dialogue.

       TWO LOGICAL STR 2'S FOUND IN "SYS" SEARCH LIST
       LOGICAL STR #1 MISSING FROM "SYS" SEARCH LIST

            These errors force the ONCE dialogue.
                                                                         Page 8

ONCE CHANGING PARAMETERS


       CHANGING PARAMETERS       ________ __________

            The "ONCE" dialogue is set up with a number  of  standard  options.
       In  general,  the  standard  options  should  be used at all times.  The
       information below should be sufficient for all but very special cases.

            When it is necessary for the "ONCE" dialogue to ask for a parameter
       to  be specified, it will print the current value, the minimum value the
       parameter may have, and the maximum value the parameter  may  have.   It
       will  then  wait  for the new value of the parameter to be typed in.  If
       (CR) is typed, the value of the parameter remains unchanged.  If certain
       parameters  are  changed  for  an  existing  structure or a unit in that
       structure, it may require that the structure be refreshed.  If  this  is
       true, a message will be printed:

       "CHANGE WILL CAUSE STR TO NEED REFRESHING"

            This is almost always a "BAD" change to make.  The best way out  is
       to  type (CR) when the parameter is requested.  Parameters should not be
       changed from the default values except in exceptional circumstances.
                                                                        Page 12

                              DISK PACK HANDLING                              ____ ____ ________
                               (MOUNTABLE PACKS)

            A damaged disk pack can represent a potential loss of  200  million
       bytes  of  valuable  information,  a  substantial repair bill and costly
       downtime.  It can also damage the disk drive, most often by damaging one
       or  more  heads.   In turn, the drive damages the next packs used on it,
       and when those packs get damaged, still more drives are damaged.

            Observing the following handling  procedures  should  prevent  disk
       damage.

           1.  Use carts whenever you can, or else support packs 
               against your body when handling them.

           2.  Keep the bottom cover on at all times.

           3.  Check the pack before taking it off the shelf
               by its handle.

           4.  Keep the pack out of the way when opening a
               drive.

           5.  Be as gentle and careful as possible when
               loading a drive.  Keep the pack vertical, and
               don't drop it the last few inches.  Don't yank
               the cover back out.  Remember, it's lighter now.

           6.  Never stop a pack with your hands.

           7.  Use racks to store empty and full covers;
               never stack cover sets.

           8.  Take immediate action when a HEAD CRASH is
               suspected:  inspect for BLACK or BROWN dust
               near window and shut down the drive if you 
               find some.  Inspect heads for debris.  Reexamine
               the pack.  Turn disk drive and pack over to
               TYMCOM-X/FSC maintenance.

           9.  Always treat a disk pack like the precision
               mechanism it is -- remember, a two-inch fall
               can lose 200 million bytes of data!

                       PACK COPY PROGRAM ON TYMCOM-10'S                       ____ ____ _______ __ ___________

                                 INTRODUCTION                                 ____________

            The PAKCOP program is  the  general  purpose  utility  package  for
       establishing,  copying and otherwise dealing with the disk packs used on
       the TYMCOM-X for file storage and swapping.  Through  this  program,  ID
       information,  HOM  and  BAT page parameters, and pack zformatting can be
       established.  One of the most commonly used capabilities is the  copying
       of  entire packs to other packs, either to provide off-line backup or to
       enable replacing error-prone disk packs with other packs.

            Since the effects of this program are so extensive, the interaction
       of  other  processes  on  the  TYMCOM-X  must  be eliminated:  PAKCOP is
       therefore a "STAND-ALONE" program - it can only be run after the  system
       has  been  taken  down;  it must be the only job running.  The important
       consequences of this program also require that the operator maintain the
       highest  level  of  caution  and attentiveness while running it from the
       console teletype.  The  RESTART  and  LIST  commands  (described  below)
       should  always  be  used  whenever  packs are moved.  During copies, the
       running packs should be write  protected.   All  pack  labels  and  tags
       should   be  kept  accurate.   In  general,  a  good  precaution  is  to
       DOUBLE-CHECK EVERYTHING whenever you are using PAKCOP!

                              COMMAND DESCRIPTION                              _______ ___________

            When the PAKCOP program is loaded, it will print its version number
       and  request  that the date and time be typed in.  PAKCOP will check and
       print the status of all units on the teletype.  PAKCOP  has  information
       assembled  into  it  about which units are on what SA-10, which channel,
       etc.

            Units are named by  their  device  addresses  because  of  possible
       differences  in configuration between systems.  The device address is in
       octal.  The low order digit corresponds to the  number  on  the  address
       plug.   If an SA-10, SA-10 channel, or 3672/3674 kontroller is off-line,
       PAKCOP will report that along with a list of the units  it  expected  to
       find on that device.  Examples:  

       KONTROLLER OFF-LINE, UNITS 340-347

            If a unit is off-line  (turned  off,  no  address  plug  with  that
       number, etc.) the report will be:

       "300 OFF-LINE"

            If the unit is on line, the report will be

       "301 ON-LINE"  (and one or more of the following msgs.)

       DUAL DENSITY (unit is a model II with twice model I capacity)
       WRITE PROTECT (the read read/write switch is in read)
       UNFORMATTED  (pack format improper; needs reformatting.)
                                                                        Page 20
PAKCOP


            Next the program prompts with "PAKCOP>" for a command.  When typing
       to  PAKCOP,  rubout  and control U can be used just as at monitor level.
       Typeout may be suppressed with control O.  Commands may be abreviated to
       as  many  characters  as  make them unique.  Three characters are always
       enough.  When waiting for a command, PAKCOP  will  ring  the  bell  once
       every  two  seconds.   PAKCOP may be aborted at any time and returned to
       command level by typing the (esc) or (alt) key.

                               GENERAL COMMANDS                               _______ ________

       SHH

            This command causes PAKCOP to stop ringing the bell.  Its effect is
       canceled whenever a command is executed.

       HELP

            This command causes a list of commands with a short description  of
       each to be printed.  THERE ARE SOME COMMANDS IN THIS LIST THAT OPERATORS                            _____ ___ ____ ________ __ ____ ____ ____ _________
       ARE NOT TO USE WITHOUT FIRST CONTACTING "TYMCOM-10" SUPPORT PERSONNEL.       ___ ___ __ ___ _______ _____ __________ ___________ _______ __________

       STATUS

            This command prints out the  status  (unformatted,  write  protect,
       etc.) of each unit which is on-line.

       RESTART

            This command causes the program to retest the status of all  units.
       If  a unit is turned on or changed from read to read/write or read/write
       to read, this command must be used for PAKCOP to sense the new status of
       the unit.  It should be used whenever packs are moved.

       BOOTS

            This command causes PAKCOP to check the units on-line in an attempt
       to find a copy of the boot program.  If it finds one it loads it in core
       and starts it.  If one is not found a message is typed and a restart  is
       performed without needing the bootstrap tape.
                                                                        Page 21

                                 UNIT COMMANDS                                 ____ ________

            The following commands require a unit or  a  set  of  units  to  be
       specified.   A  single unit is specified by typing its number.  A set of
       units may be specified by typing a list of numbers as 300,301  or  "ALL"
       may  be  used.   If ALL is used, the command will affect all units which
       are on-line.  If the unit number of a drive which is off-line, or  if  a
       bad  string  (not  numbers, etc.) is typed the operator will be asked to
       retype the drive list.  Each of the following commands  is  followed  by
       either  (list) or (one unit) to indicate whether the command will accept
       a list of units or only one.

       LIST (list)

            This command lists information from the HOM and BAT  pages  on  the
       unit.   If the HOM and BAT pages are not correct or have hardware errors
       one or more of the following messages may appear:  

       FIRST HOM PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       SECOND HOM PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       FIRST HOM PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR
       SECOND HOM PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR
       FIRST BAT PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       SECOND BAT PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       FIRST BAT PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR
       SECOND BAT PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR

            The information printed from the HOM and BAT pages is:

       UNIT ID: 280203
       STRUCTURE: DSKB LOGICAL UNIT: DSKB0
       NO COPY DATE       OR      LAST COPY DATE 12-NOV-1973
       NUMBER OF BAD REGIONS: 1
       NUMBER OF BAD SECTORS: 1
       RECORD,HEAD,CYL 5,13,107
       1 RECORDS(S)  12-NOV-1973     OR     NO DATE


                                         NOTE

           (If there are no errors indicated  in  the  BAT  pages  'NO  BAD
           SPOTS' will be printed.)

       The following command is a VERY DANGEROUS command to use.  If it is used                                  ____ _________
       at  any  time other than shown in this document, you will not be able to
       bring the system up.  If you inadvertently  use  it  when  you  are  not
       suppose to, STOP and call your Shift Supervisor, Operations Coordinator,                   ____
       or Operations Manager immediately.  Throughout this  document,  whenever
       this command is used, there is a WARNING message.                                        _______
       ***********************************************************************

       INIT (one unit) (See "WARNING" above)
                                                                        Page 22
PAKCOP


            This command initializes the HOM and BAT pages on a unit.   If  the
       unit already has HOM pages, PAKCOP will ask 

       UNIT ALREADY HAS HOM PAGES, OVERWRITE? 

            An answer of YES is required (or Y or YE) in order to write new HOM
       and BAT pages.

            The command will then prompt

       'ID:'.  

            The ID to be specified is any  6  characters.   However,  the  copy
       command  expects  the  first  two character to be the system number, the
       second two characters to be  the  pack  set  number  and  the  last  two
       characters to be the pack number.

       NEW
       (one unit)

            This command changes the ID in the HOM page on the  selected  unit.
       The unit must already have valid HOM pages.  The prompt is

       'ID:'.

            The 3330 type disks have the ability to  use  alternate  tracks  to
       take  care  of  bad spots on a pack.  A track may be marked as defective
       with a pointer to its alternate.  Every  time  the  defective  track  is
       referenced,  the alternate will be read or written instead.  This avoids
       problems with inconsistant BAT pages on a copy.  PAKCOP can  report  and
       check  the alternate tracks that have been set up.  A fresh pack has 133
       possible alternate tracks.

       VERIFY (list)

            This command checks the formatting of  the  entire  pack.   If  the
       formatting is correct, the message 

       'VERIFIED UNIT 367'

            will be printed.  If the format is not correct, an  error  will  be
       printed:

       'UNIT 301 BAD ALTERNATE TRACK SETUP ON CYL 135 HEAD 15'

       or

       'INCORRECT FORMAT' 

            followed by 

       'UNIT 300 DOES NOT VERIFY'

            If the bad alternate track message is printed,  give  the  printout
       and  the  pack  to  your Shift Supervisor.  The VERIFY command calls the
       AVERIFY command.
                                                                        Page 23
PAKCOP


       ZFORMAT (list)

            Zero out all alternate track assignments.  This command  wipes  out
       any  previous  bad  track  information  and  formats  the  entire  pack,
       including alternate cylinders.

            This command establishes the correct format on a pack.  The  format
       command  calls  the  AFORMAT  command.  It also calls the VERIFY command
       when it has finished to insure that the format has been  correctly  set.
       If PAKCOP believes that the pack is already formatted, it will ask:  

       'UNIT 300 ALREADY FORMATTED, REFORMAT?'

            An answer of YES will cause the pack to be reformatted.   If  there
       are no errors, the message

       'UNIT 301, ALTERNATE TRACKING ZEROED'

            will be printed.  Possible errors are:

       UNIT 301 DOES NOT VERIFY
       (the format was written with no error indication but won't verify)

       UNIT 301 BAD ALTERNATE TRACK SETUP ON CYL 135 HEAD 15
       (save the printout and notify the Shift Supervisor)

            Any hardware error will be followed by the message

       'FORMAT ABORTED'.

       COPY (list)

            The copy command has several options which are  selected  by  sense
       switches  1,  2 and 3.  The COPY command will always print out a list of
       the options as currently selected.  The normal  mode  of  operations  is
       with none of the switches on.

            SWITCH 1 [40] OFF

       alternate tracks will be assigned for pages
       indicated bad in BAT pages on the destination pack (sense switch 1)

            SWITCH 1 [40] ON

       copy will abort if any bad regions are
       indicated in the BAT pages on the destination pack (sense switch 1)

            SWITCH 2 [20] OFF

       copy will abort on read errors from source pack
       for pages not marked bad (sense switch 2)

            SWITCH 2 [20] ON

       read errors from source pack will be reported but
       copy will continue (sense switch 2)
                                                                        Page 24
PAKCOP


            SWITCH 3 [10] OFF

       alternate tracks will be assigned for pages
       with read or write errors on destination pack (sense switch 3)

            SWITCH 3 [10] ON

       copy will abort on read or write errors on
       destination pack (sense switch 3)

            After printing the options currently in force, PAKCOP
       prompts with:

       'SOURCE DRIVES:'

            A list of source drives may be specified. Since the program takes
       advantage of I/O overlap, copying more than one drive at a time
       is an advantage.

            After the list of source drives is typed, the following
       is repeated for each source drive.

       "COPY FROM 300 TO:"

            PAKCOP now wants the unit number of the destination drive
       for the specified source drive. After this number is
       supplied, any of a number of errors may result.

       SOURCE PACK NOT FORMATTED
       DESTINATION DRIVE IS NOT FORMATTED
       SOURCE DRIVE NOT WRITE PROTECTED
       DESTINATION DRIVE IS WRITE PROTECTED
       DESTINATION DRIVE IN USE BY A COPY 
       (the destination drive specified for more than one copy operation)
       DRIVES NOT OF THE SAME DENSITY 
       (one is dual density and the other is single density)

            Any of these messages will cause this copy (not all of them) to
       terminate. Whenever a copy terminates, a message will be printed

       "COPY FROM 300 TO 301 ABORTED".

            PAKCOP will not read the HOM and BAT pages on both units.
       Any HOM or BAT page errors will abort the copy.  The HOM ID'S
       of both units will be checked as well as the copy dates. When a
       copy is completed, the copy date of the destination pack is set
       to the current date. Any one of a number of messages may
       now be printed

       DESTINATION COPY DATE LATER THAN SOURCE COPY DATE
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION SYSTEM NUMBERS DIFFER
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION UNIT NUMBERS DIFFER
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION SET NUMBERS ARE THE SAME
                                                                        Page 25
PAKCOP


            Then the message 

       "COPY FROM (TIME/DATE/NODATE) 280203 TO 280103 (TIME/DATE/NODATE)

       OK?" 

            will be printed.  The units are specified by their HOM ID'S in this
       message.   If  the  answer is not YES, the copy will be aborted.  If the
       answer is YES, the copy will proceed as follows:

            The BAT pages of the destination unit  will  be  checked.   If  any
       pages  are indicated as bad, they will be checked by writing and reading
       some selected data patterns.  If any are really found  to  be  bad,  the
       copy  will  either abort or attempt to assign alternate tracks depending
       on the setting of sense switch 1.  If alternate tracks are  assigned,  a
       message will be printed as 

       'CYL,HEAD 407,3 ASSIGNED AS ALTERNATE FOR CYL,HEAD 125,8' 

            If no more alternates are available, the message 

       'NO MORE ALTERNATE TRACKS AVAILABLE' 

            will print and the copy will be aborted.

            After the BAT pages on the destination pack have been checked,  the
       copy  will  proceed  by reading data from the source unit, writing it on
       the destination unit, reading it back from  the  destination  unit,  and
       comparing  the  data.   If  no  errors are detected the HOM pages on the
       destination pack are then updated with the copy date and  the  structure
       information from the source pack.  The BAT pages of the destination pack
       are cleared.  A final message is printed:  

       "COPY COMPLETED FROM 301 TO 300"
                                                                        Page 26

           1.  Always change the label information when a pack
               is copied.  Write PACK ID and serial number of pack on label.

           2.  Always keep drives with source (copy from packs)
               in READ only.

           3.  Always issue RESTART and LIST commands whenever
               drive/pack status changes (packs are moved).

           4.  Keep PAKCOP hardcopy with the swap out
               pack following a copy.

           5.  Always DOUBLE and TRIPLE check everything.

           6.  Under NO circumstances is the SOURCE pack
               ever to be left on a drive that is NOT
               WRITE PROTECTED.

           7.  The LIST command should be run before and after
               each COPY command to verify that the right packs are
               being used and that the copy was successful.

           8.  Drive plugs are NOT to be moved unless directed by Center
               Manager, his Designated Representative, or Shift Supervisor.

PAKCOP ERRORS


       ERRORS       ______

            In most cases unrecoverable errors will be reported.  The only case
       in  which  this  is  not true is if the program interprets the error for
       some other purpose.  For example, the copy command when  it  is  testing
       pages marked bad to see if they are really bad.

            There are five places where errors may happen:  Reading the  source
       pack;   Writing  the  destination  pack;   Reading the destination pack;
       Checking data after readback;  And writing the updated HOM pages.

            If any read or write errors occur, they are analized to see if they
       are  data errors or probable hardware errors (overrun, etc.) If they are
       hardware errors the error and a message 

       PROBABLE HARDWARE ERROR ON SOURCE PACK
       WRITE ERROR ON DESTINATION PACK
       (PROBABLE HARDWARE ERROR)
       READ ERROR ON DESTINATION PACK
       (PROBABLE HARDWARE ERROR)

            is printed and the copy is aborted.

            For a read error on the source pack which is a probable data  error
       the BAT pages on the source pack are checked.  If the error is in a page
       marked bad, the message

       "ERROR IS IN A PAGE MARKED BAD. CONTINUING"

            is printed and the copy continues.

            If the error is in a page not marked in the  BAT  pages,  the  copy
       will  abort  after  typing  the  error if sense switch 2 is not set.  If
       sense switch 2 is set, the error will be printed followed by

       "CONTINUING".

            For read or write errors on the destination pack, either  the  copy
       will  abort  after  printing the error (sense switch 3 set) or the error
       will be printed and an attempt made to assign an alternate  track.   The
       copy will abort only if an alternate track can not be assigned.

            Data compare errors always abort the copy with the message

       "DATA DOES NOT COMPARE BUT NO HARDWARE
       DETECTED ERRORS"

            Failure to write the updated HOM pages results in the message 

       "CAN NOT WRITE HOM PAGES ON DESTINATION
       PACK AFTER ALL PAGES COPIED".

            The destination pack may contain  incorrect  copy  date  and  other
       wrong data.
                                                                        Page 30
PAKCOP ERRORS


            After an error during a copy you  should  recopy  the  packs  again
       possibly using different disk drives.

            PAKCOP only prints  error  messages  for  non-recoverable  hardware
       errors.  If the unit goes off-line the message 

       "UNIT 363 HAS GONE OFF-LINE"

            will be printed.

            All other error mesages start with 

       "UNRECOVERABLE ERROR ON UNIT 361
       CYLINER 107,HEAD 2,RECORD 14"

            The messages which may print from the SA-10 are 

       SELECT ERROR
       BUS IN PARITY ERROR
       CONTROL ERROR
       LENGTH ERROR
       INTERUPT ERROR

            Error output from the status byte would be:

       ATTENTION
       BUSY
       UNIT EXCEPTION

            And from the decoded sense bytes the following:

       BUS OUT PARITY ERROR
       OVERRUN
       INVALID TRACK FORMAT
       NO RECORD FOUND
       PROTECTION FAILURE
       DATA CHECK
       COMMAND REJECT
       UNIT IS WRITE PROTECTED
       EQUIPMENT CHECK
       PERMANENT EQUIPMENT CHECK

            The following will be printed only if no sense can be made
       from the sense bytes returned:

       UNKNOWN ERROR BYTE 1 BIT 2
                                                                        Page 31

            At this time change all pack ID'S to be  the  same  as  when  first
       started.   This  is  necessary  in case of a rebuild if you use ASP DUMP
       tapes.  The pack ID'S' must match those at the time of the ASP save.

       Do not use the "INIT" command here.  If you do, you have overwritten the
       "HOME"  and  "BAT"  pages,  and will not be able to bring the system up.
       You will need to "RE-ZFORMAT", "RE-INITIALIZE" and redo  the  "COPY"  on
       all packs that were done incorrectly.

REBUILD 3675'S WITH A/F TAPES


               REBUILDING THE FILE SYSTEM WITH "ALL-FILE" TAPES               __________ ___ ____ ______ ____ __________ _____

                          (3330'S MOUNTED ON 3675's)                          _______ _______ __ _______

       REBUILD AUTHORIZATION       _______ _____________

            This document outline the procedures for rebuilding a TYMCOM-X file
       system  from  ALL-FILES  and  BACKUP  tapes.  The Center Manager, or his
       Designated Representative, and the  TYMCOM-10  Systems  Support  Service
       should verify that a REBUILD is necessary.

       PREPARATION       ___________

            The current version of the following tapes will  be  needed  during
       the REBUILD.

           A.  Tape with copy of SYSTEM.SAV or NEWMON.SAV for system being
       REBUILT.

           B.  Tape with copy of TITO.SAV.

           C.  Tape with copy of PAKCOP.SAV 

           D.  Most current set of ALL-FILES for system being REBUILT.

           E.  HARDCOPY directory of Tape #1 of ALL-FILES.

           F.  All BACKUP tapes taken after latest ALL-FILES.

       PROCEDURE       _________

            Enter  the  DOWNTIME  message  announcing  the  situation.   Use  a
       reasonable  estimate  of  how  long  the rebuild will take.  The message
       should be in the following form:

               "SYSTEM X IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. WE ESTIMATE ITS
                RETURN TO SERVICE AT "HHMM TIMEZONE" TIME ON "MM/DD"."


                                         NOTE

           As the rebuild progresses, the downtime estimate may need to  be
           revised.   If so, change it using two or three hour increments -
           this avoids the tendency to annoy users with shorter revisions.



            Remove the clobbered pack/packs and get other pack/packs ready.  It
       is  essential that the pack/packs which is suspected to be clobbered not
       be used.  Request TYMCOM-X/FSC maintenance to check out the hardware  to
       determine if it is safe to use.

            Remove the PLASTIC CRESCENT LABELS.  Identify each pack/packs  with
       their ID'S and SERIAL NUMBER on ALUMINUM SPINDLE in center of pack.  Use
       "BLACK" felt pen only.  Mount pack on disk drive.

       After the System is down, and it is at the "BOOTS" prompt, load  in  the
       "PACKCOPY"  version from disk.  The "PACKCOPY" program PAKCPX.SAV should
       be called before taking the disk drives off-line.  If not,  the  program
       will  have  to  be  loaded  via tape.  It may be helpful to list out the
       "HELP" commands after entering the date, time, and after the  status  of
       drives prints out.

                          CHECKING DISK DRIVE STATUS                          ________ ____ _____ ______

       Before performing a "PACKCOPY", you need to put the pack to be copied to
       "ON-LINE"  and  in  "READ/WRITE" mode.  All other "PACKS" must be put in                                                                 ____
       "READ ONLY" mode.

       Go to the back of the module, and after opening the double doors, locate
       the  panel  that  has "CE MODE" and "SERVICE BYPASS" on it.  You will be
       working with the toggle switch under "CE MODE" only.  

       If drive is OFF-LINE, move "CE MODE" toggle switch to  middle  and  then
       push "ATTENTION" button on drive to put it "ON-LINE".

                          PUTTING ONE DRIVE OFF-LINE                          _______ ___ _____ ________

       To take drive "OFF-LINE", move "CE MODE" switch in  direction  of  drive
       you want "OFF-LINE".

                     PUTTING BOTH DRIVES (MODULE) OFF-LINE                     _______ ____ ______ ________ ________

       Toggle "CE MODE" switch to "A" then "B", then return  to  middle.   Both
       drives are now "OFF-LINE".


                                         NOTE

                       * * * * * C A U T I O N * * * * *

           If the "CE MODE" switch is left in either position, "A" or  "B",
           that drive cannot be brought "ON-LINE" until the switch is moved
           to the "MIDDLE".

            Enter  the  DOWNTIME  message  announcing  the  situation.   Use  a
       reasonable  estimate  of  how  long  the rebuild will take.  The message
       should be in the following form:

               "SYSTEM X IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. WE ESTIMATE ITS
                RETURN TO SERVICE AT "HHMM TIMEZONE" TIME ON "MM/DD"."


                                         NOTE

           As the rebuild progresses, the downtime estimate may need to  be
           revised.   If so, change it using two or three hour increments -
           this avoids the tendency to annoy users with shorter revisions.



            Take the UNIT that caused the problem OFF-LINE.  Put the spare UNIT
       ON-LINE.  Refer to PAKCOP, PART II, for these procedures.  The UNIT that
       caused the problem will need to be written up and reported to FSC.

            After the pack/packs are online, set sense switch #4 and FTALOD the
       correct PACKCOPY tape.

       After the System is down, and it is at the "BOOTS" prompt, load  in  the
       "PACKCOPY" version from disk.  The "PACKCOPY" program PAKCPX.SAV for the
       "BLOCK" monitor, or the PAKCP5.SAV for the  "PAGE"  monitor,  should  be
       called before taking the disk drives off-line.  If not, the program will
       have to be loaded via tape.  It may be helpful to list  out  the  "HELP"
       commands  after  entering the date, time, and after the status of drives
       prints out.

       Before performing a "PACKCOPY", you need to put the pack to be copied to
       "ON-LINE"  and  in  "READ/WRITE" mode.  All other "PACKS" must be put in                                                                 ____

       Go to the back of the module, and after opening the double doors, locate
       the  panel  that  has "CE MODE" and "SERVICE BYPASS" on it.  You will be
       working with the toggle switch under "CE MODE" only.  

       If drive is OFF-LINE, move "CE MODE" toggle switch to  middle  and  then
       push "ATTENTION" button on drive to put it "ON-LINE".

                          PUTTING ONE DRIVE OFF-LINE                          _______ ___ _____ ________

       To take drive "OFF-LINE", move "CE MODE" switch in  direction  of  drive
       you want "OFF-LINE".

                     PUTTING BOTH DRIVES (MODULE) OFF-LINE                     _______ ____ ______ ________ ________

       Toggle "CE MODE" switch to "A" then "B", then return  to  middle.   Both
       drives are now "OFF-LINE".

           If the "CE MODE" switch is left in either position, "A" or  "B",
           that drive cannot be brought "ON-LINE" until the switch is moved
           to the "MIDDLE".

REBUILD 3650'S WITH A/F TAPES


               REBUILDING THE FILE SYSTEM WITH "ALL-FILE" TAPES               __________ ___ ____ ______ ____ __________ _____

                          (3350'S MOUNTED ON 3650's)                          _______ _______ __ _______

       REBUILD AUTHORIZATION       _______ _____________

            This document outline the procedures for rebuilding a TYMCOM-X file
       system  from  ALL-FILES  and  BACKUP  tapes.  The Center Manager, or his
       Designated Representative, and the  TYMCOM-10  Systems  Support  Service
       should verify that a REBUILD is necessary.

       PREPARATION       ___________

            The current version of the following tapes will  be  needed  during
       the REBUILD.

           A.  Tape with copy of SYSTEM.SAV or NEWMON.SAV for system being
       REBUILT.

           B.  Tape with copy of TITO.SAV.

           C.  Tape with copy of PAKCPX.SAV, or
               Tape with copy of PAKCP5.SAV (If rebuilding System 74)

           D.  Most current set of ALL-FILES for system being REBUILT.

           E.  HARDCOPY directory of Tape #1 of ALL-FILES.

           F.  All BACKUP tapes taken after latest ALL-FILES.

       PROCEDURE       _________

            Enter  the  DOWNTIME  message  announcing  the  situation.   Use  a
       reasonable  estimate  of  how  long  the rebuild will take.  The message
       should be in the following form:

               "SYSTEM X IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. WE ESTIMATE ITS
                RETURN TO SERVICE AT "HHMM TIMEZONE" TIME ON "MM/DD"."


                                         NOTE

           As the rebuild progresses, the downtime estimate may need to  be
           revised.   If so, change it using two or three hour increments -
           this avoids the tendency to annoy users with shorter revisions.



            Take the UNIT that caused the problem OFF-LINE.  Put the spare UNIT
       ON-LINE.   Refer  to  PAKCOP,  PART III, for these procedures.  The UNIT
       that caused the problem will need to be written up and reported to FSC.

            After the pack/packs are online, set sense switch #4 and FTALOD the
       correct PACKCOPY tape.

                (5)  All BACKUP tapes taken after latest ASP dump.

       PROCEDURE       _________

            A.  After it has been determined that a REBUILD is necessary  issue
       the "TMS downtime message using the following format:

               "SYSTEM X IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. WE ESTIMATE ITS
                RETURN TO SERVICE AT 'HHMM TIMEZONE' TIME ON 'MM/DD'."
                                                                       Page 104
REBUILD USING "ASP" DUMP TAPES


            Use a reasonable estimate of how long the rebuild will take.


                                         NOTE

           As the rebuild progresses, the downtime estimate may need to  be
           revised.   If so, change it using two or three hour increments -
           this avoids the tendency to annoy users with shorter revisions.



            B.  It is  essential  that  the  pack  which  is  suspected  to  be
       clobbered not be used for the REBUILD.

               (1) If it is a 3330 disk  pack  that  was  clobbered  this  pack
               should be cycled out and another pack cycled in.

               (2) If it is a 3350 disk  pack  running  on  3650's/3652's,  the
               unit(s)  will  be placed OFF-LINE and written up for checking by
               FSC.  The spare UNIT running on the string should be used.

            C.  After the pack is online, set sense switch #4  and  FTALOD  the
       correct PACKCOPY tape.  ZFORMAT and INITIALIZE the pack that is replaced
       with the same pack ID.  When completed, put all packs ON-LINE  and  take
       the   PAKCOP  tape  off.   FTALOD  the  current  running  SYSTEM.SAV  or
       NEWMON.SAV monitor tape.

       ************************************************************************
       ************************************************************************

            If the system should CRASH during the ASP restore, return here  and
       FTALOD  the  current  running SYSTEM.SAV or NEWMON.SAV and continue with
       step D.
       ************************************************************************
       ************************************************************************

            D.  After the monitor  has  loaded,  enter  CONSOLE  at  the  ONCE>

       the FILES* prompt.

            F.  Enter DISSOLVE and a YES answer.

            G.  At the next FILES* prompt, enter DEFINE with a YES answer.   At
       this  point  enter  all the BP'S that are on line as reported when FILES
       was entered at the ONCE> prompt in step E.  Enter two  carriage  returns
       after the last one is entered.

            H.  Next enter the REFRESH command with a YES answer.

            I.  At the next FILES* prompt, enter TYPE ALL.  This  command  will
       let  you  know  if you missed anything when entering the BP'S in step G.
       If you did, start over from step F.

            J.  The next command to be entered is GO at the next ONCE> prompt.

            K.  At this time enter  READONLY.   After  the  status  of  drives,
       memory  online,  and  the statement 'To automatically login, etc' prints
       out, you will be asked to log in.  The log in procedures are  documented
       in PDPTAP.M1A under FREMONTDOC on System 74.


            L.  After logging in, set date and time,  and  change  schedule  to
       600000.

            M.  Mount and load the current copy of ASP.SAV that is  being  used
       on the system.

            N.  Start restoring all ASP tapes.

            O.  After all ASP tapes are restored, get KLDCP attention.  Enter a
       ^X (Control X) on the terminal.

            P.  Enter SP (CR), DT0 (CR), P BOTLOD  (CR),  GO  (CR),  and  press
       carriage return for each '>.' prompt.  After BOOTS:  prints out, enter a
       carriage return if coming  up  on  (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV.   If  coming  up  on
       (SYS)NEWMON.SAV, then type in NEWMON and a carriage return.

            Q.  If there are NO BACKUP tapes to be restored, then type in  FULL
       at the ONCE> prompt and continue with paragraph X.

            R.  If BACKUP tapes are to be restored then,  at  the  first  ONCE>
       prompt  enter  CONSOLE;   at the next ONCE> prompt, type in NOINITIA and
       then type in FULL at the next ONCE> prompt.

            S.  Once DSKCLN has started, YOU  MUST  WAIT  until  it  completes.
       After  DSKCLN completes, the statement 'Initialization completed ?  date
       and time not set' will print out.  Terminal will BEEP a couple of times.
       Now  you  can  log  in.   In  any case, wait at least TWO MINUTES before
       proceeding.

            T.  At this time you will need your Shift Supervisor set STATUS for
       you,  or  someone  who does have enough LICENSE to set STATUS, to insure
       all files on the BACKUP tapes are restored properly.

            U.  After STATUS has been set, type in R BOOTS and  press  carriage
       return.

            V.  Call TITO from disk and start restoring all BACKUP  tapes.   Be
       sure you set the following switches.

                *FLAGOFF

                *MODE OLD TAPE

            W.  After all BACKUP tapes are restored, bring the system down with
       TAKEIT,  using  HANG  option.   At  the  BOOTS:  prompt enter a carriage
       return  if  coming   up   on   (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV.    If   coming   up   on
       (SYS)NEWMON.SAV,  type  in  NEWMON  and a carriage return.  At the ONCE>
       prompt, enter FULL.

            X.  When system comes up, set STATUS, type in  R  BOOTS,  and  then
       place the following ACCESS.MSG on the system.

                 System (SYSTEM NUMBER)  has  (WHAT  CAUSED  REBUILD)  and  the
            system  has been rebuilt from the ASP tapes taken (DATE) and BACKUP
            tapes taken (DATE) through (DATE) on (DATE).  If you  have  special

            we will be happy to assist you.

            Y.  Do a SYSTAT DISK and check PACK ID'S with slap tags.  Pack ID'S
       may or may not have changed.  If they did, update the slap tags.
                                                                       Page 107
FILE PACK ADDING


                              ADDING A FILE PACK                              ______ _ ____ ____

       NOTIFICATION       ____________

            This section outlines the procedure for adding a pack to  the  file
       structure.   System  Resources  Allocation  (SRA) will notify the Center
       Manager, or his Designated Representative, before pack(s) are added to a
       system.   This notification should be made within a reasonable amount of
       time to allow the Center to make preparations.

       PREPARATION       ___________

            Before adding a FILE PACK to a system, certain preparations  should
       be performed first.

            A.  Are there enough Disk Drives on the System?  If not,  are  they
       available and when can they be added?

            B.  Are Disk Packs available?  If not, when will they be available?
       If adding to 3650's/3652's has the UNITS been DSF?  If not, this must be
       done first.

            C.  Determine what the PACK(S) ID will  be  and  write  them  on  a
       CRESCENT TAPE LABEL and put on the pack cannister(s).  On 3650's/3652's,
       tape the label to the disk drive.

            D.  Special-schedule the  system  down  and  inform  Users  of  the
       schedule by issuing the ACCESS.MSG and the BROADCAST.MESSAGE.

            E.  ACCOUNTING and BACKUP should be completed.

            F.  Mount the pack/packs to be used  on  a  spare  disk  drive  and
       remove  the crescent PLASTIC LABEL.  Write the pack ID and SERIAL NUMBER
       on the Aluminum Spindle in the center of the pack (3330's  only).   Make
       up slap-tags with the same information.

            G.  Use next ASP rotating set of tapes for FIRST ASP dump.

            H.  Make up a NEW set of tapes for  ASP  dump  to  be  taken  after
       pack/packs is/are added.

            I.  Before starting TAKEIT make sure SSW #4 is set and run  a  PSP.
       If  the PSP shows HDEV, HDAT, SATFAILS, RIBS, or THUNGS errors, save the
       PSP output.

            J.  At the appropriate time, ususally TWO  hours  before  scheduled
       downtime, issue the PSCHED letter.  Issue the DOWNTIME message after the
       system is down.

            K.  Now is the time to check to make sure you have the correct  ASP
       tapes  for  the  system  and  that  ALL labels and straps are identified
       correctly and dated the date the ASP dump is taken.
                                                                       Page 108

                              TAKING SYSTEM DOWN                              ______ ______ ____

            After performing all of the above, the system  can  be  taken  down
       using these procedures:

           1.  Run TAKEIT with BOOTS-LOADED option.

           2.  After the system is down at BOOTS:, press
               carriage return to load the current running SYSTEM.SAV.


                                         NOTE

           If system is suppose to be up on NEWMON,  enter  NEWMON  at  the
           BOOTS:  prompt and then press carriage return.


           3.  After the monitor has loaded, the system is at ONCE> dialogue
               mode.  (Be careful while in this mode).

           4.  At the ONCE> prompt, enter CONSOLE and a carriage return.


                                         NOTE

           If there were any HDEV, HDAT, SATFAILS, RIBS, or THUNGS reported
           when  running  the PSP, continue with next step, else go to step
           12 and continue.


           5.  At the next ONCE> prompt, enter FULL and a carriage return.

           6.  Once DSKCLN has started, YOU MUST WAIT until it completes.
               After DSKCLN completes, the statement "initialization completed
               ? date and time not set" will print out.  terminal will BEEP
               a couple of times.  Now you can log in.  In any case, wait at
               least TWO (02) MINUTES before proceeding.

           7.  Do a CTRL-Z L and type in OPER and a carriage return.
               (CTRL-Z, L, and OPER will not output to CTY/TTY).

           8.  After the carriage return is entered, 'please log in:' will
               output along with the statement:

               'date not set, type date as mm-dd-yyyy'

               Enter date as:  04-27-1987 (cr)

           9.  The next statement that outputs is:

               'type time as hh:mm'

               Enter time as: 08:00 (cr)

           10. Next, set status, and run TAKEIT with BOOTS-LOADED option.
                                                                       Page 109

           11. Repeat steps 2 through 4 above.

           12. At the next ONCE> prompt, enter READONLY (cr).

           13. Login as explained in steps 7 through 9 and continue with
               next step.

           14. SET STATUS and then change schedule to 600000.

           15. At the TYMCOM-10 prompt (!), enter:

               '!'R ASP (cr)                                     
                  (approximately 10 to 12 minutes for each save and
                   verify tape)

           16. After the ASP Save has completed, and the tapes verified
           then type in:

               ^X
               'KLDCP'
               '.'SP (cr)
               '>.'P BOTLOD (cr)
               '>.'GO (cr)
               '>.' (cr)

            At the BOOTS:  prompt, type in PAKCOP.  Type in the date and  time.
       After  the  disk drive status prints out, and it is verified, type in SH
       at the PAKCOP prompt.  Put the running set in READ ONLY mode.  (Pull  ID
       plugs on 3330's).  Put the pack(s) to be added on-line and in READ/WRITE
       mode.  Make sure the pack(s) are on the next HIGHEST BP'S to be added.

            At the PAKCOP prompt in PAKCOP enter RESTART.  The  BP'S  that  you
       are adding to the file structure should report as the only ones on-line,
       all other should report being  off-line.   ZFORMAT  and  INITIALIZE  the
       pack(s).  When initializing the pack(s) give them the same set number as
       the running set.  You should do a LIST and check the ID'S  in  case  you
       made a mistake.

            IF YOU DID ENTER THE PACK(S) ID INCORRECTLY, USE THE "NEW"  COMMAND            __ ___ ___ _____ ___ _______ __ ____________ ___ ___ _____  _______
       TO  CHANGE  IT.   DO  NOT  USE THE "INIT" COMMAND AND OVERWRITE THE HOME       __  ______  ___   __  ___  ___ ___ ______ _______ ___ _________ ___ ____
       BLOCK INFORMATION.         _____ ____________

            If  this  should  happen,  you  will   need   to   RE-ZFORMAT   and
       RE-INITIALIZE the pack(s) you are adding.

            Upon completion of the above put all packs on-line.  At the  PAKCOP
       prompt,  enter  BOOTS  and a carriage return if coming up on SYSTEM.SAV.
       Enter another carriage return at the BOOTS LOADED prompt.   The  monitor
       is now loading.

            If coming up on NEWMON.SAV, then enter (^X) Control X at the PAKCOP
       prompt.   Enter  SP,  P BOTLOD, and GO.  After BOOTS prints out, type in
       NEWMON.  The monitor is now loading.
