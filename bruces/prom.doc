The  purpose of this  document is to  outline  those steps necessary to pull
the  PICO firmware code down to a prom burned and burn the proms.  It should
be noted that the responses from the prom burner  may differ depending  upon
the manufacturer of the prom burner.


The path for the firmware code for PICO Version 1.10 is:

     /home/gemini/nts/bruces/pico


The filename for the code is:

     PICO110.rom		(Note UPPER and lower case letters)



The  addresses used for  splitting the file  and  burning  the proms depends
on the amount of RAM in the prom burner:

     128K RAM  uses address 10000
     256K RAM  uses address 20000


The family code and pin out for the different proms we use are as
follows:

     Manufacturer	Family Code	Pin Out Code
     -----------	------ ----	--- --- ----

     Toshiba     	   5A		    4E
     Intel


Checksums for the EVEn and ODD proms for PICO 1.10 firmware are as follows:

     EVEN	
     ODD	



The  following  steps  will  be  necessary  to  insure  the  proms  are done
successfully:


  o  Log terminal connected to prom burner into GEMINI and CD to  the  above
     directory.  Verify the checksum of the firmware file  is good  by using
     CSUM10 command.  The checksum should be:

       0WIZFIM5


  o  Ready the prom burner:

       Command Entered			Response From
       On  Prom Burner			 Prom Burner
       ---------------			-------------


       SELECT 8 7 START			MOT EXORMAX
     
       START				FORMAT NO 087 **
     
       COPY PORT RAM START		INPUT PORT 0

     
  o  On the terminal logged into GEMINI, type
  
       cat PICO110.rom          (Note UPPER and lower case letters)


     If the download is working the 0 (from INPUT PORT 0) will change into a
     clock, with a rapidly moving hand.  When the input is finished the prom
     burner will display:

    
       INPUT DONE xxxx

  
  o  Splitting  of the  data in  the prom  burner RAM is the next step.  The 
     starting  address  will depend  upon the  number of  bytes in the  prom
     burner RAM (see above):


       Command Entered			Response From
       On  Prom Burner			 Prom Burner
       ---------------			-------------
       
       SELECT A 5 START			SPLIT RAM 20000
       
       START
       
     
     The  prom burner will  once again change  the 0  (from SPLIT RAM 20000)
     into a clock,  indicating the RAM  is being split.   Once the splitting
     is complete the prom burner will display:

       SPLIT RAM **


  o  Burn  the  EVEN  half of  the  prom set.  The EVEN half  goes  into IOC
     location 5H.

       Command Entered			Response From
       On  Prom Burner			 Prom Burner
       ---------------			-------------
       
       COPY				COPY RAM FROM
       RAM				RAM ADDR/SIZE
       0				RAM 0000/SIZE
       DEVICE				CO RAM>DEV ADDR
       
       START				FAM 00 PIN 00
       5 E A 4 				FAM 5E PIN A4
       
       At this point a red LED should light up on the UniPak 2 (or whichever
       device is being)  used to  indicate the  a the  blank prom  is  to be
       inserted into.  
       

       START				TEST DEVICE     0
 				       	PROGRAM DEVICE  0
					VERIFY DEVICE   0
					PROGRAM DONE xx yyyy


       The "xx yyyy"  is the  checksum for the  EVEN prom,  and should match
       the  checksum listed in the beginning of this document.  Note this on
       the  label to be used to cover the window  on the prom  after it  has
       been burned.

  o  Burn  the  ODD  half of  the  prom  set.  The  ODD half  goes  into IOC
     location 5L.

       Command Entered			Response From
       On  Prom Burner			 Prom Burner
       ---------------			-------------
       
       COPY				COPY RAM FROM
       RAM				RAM ADDR/SIZE
       20000				RAM 20000/SIZE
       DEVICE				CO RAM>DEV ADDR
       
       START				FAM 00 PIN 00
       5 E A 4 				FAM 5E PIN A4
       
       At this point a red LED should light up on the UniPak 2 (or whichever
       device is being)  used to  indicate the  a the  blank prom  is  to be
       inserted into.  
       

       START				TEST DEVICE     0
 				       	PROGRAM DEVICE  0
					VERIFY DEVICE   0
					PROGRAM DONE xx yyyy


       The "xx yyyy"  is the  checksum for the  EVEN prom,  and should match
       the  checksum listed in the beginning of this document.  Note this on
       the  label to be used to cover the window  on the prom  after it  has
       been burned.


  o  The  process is  complete,  insert  the proms  into a  PICO engine  and 
     run the IOCBug Self Tests 1-9.
