Guys,

Here  is a  brief recap  of the screw job NTS got today under the directionf
of Don Murtaugh ......

There  is NO  longer an  NTS organization .... the new structure under  Don
Murtaugh is called Service Management and is broken down as follows:

                        Murtaugh

Doug Ellenberg        Roger Babcock                   Peter O'Harrow

                      Diagnostci Tools Support       Support Maintenance
                                                          
Some STS	        Some STS			Some STS
                        Ed Mooring/Sandra Nilluka       NTS Hardware


As you will notice there are two KEY people missing from the chart:

    DON JOHNSON
    RON VIVIER

Don is now  a dotted  line report  to Murtaugh  handling  the Field Service
contract and related issues.

Ron is now a direct report to Murtaugh doing special projects.

Tim Kochmann  is still    manager of  our  hardware  side  although  he  is
a direct report to Peter.

Now  for my  personal opinion ......... the death of  NTS is  a major  blow
to  not only  us but to  the support of  the field and it's customers.  You
will no  longer  see the emphasis placed  on  supporting the  customer that
Don Johnson,  Ron Vivier  and  Tim Kochmann have  shown in the past.  There
is  NO way that  Peter  or  Don Murtaugh  will be as  supportive  of  field
offices and customers needs as NTS was.   We all know the level of  support
you  see with  custom  interfaces (PBT/PBT,  PTI/PHI, etc)  and those  were
under Peter in the past ....

From the BTT HK/HSBC standpoint I think you'll  see minimal loss in support
since  both Tim and I have no  intention of changing  the level  of support
unless we are directed to do so.

We won't leave you guys hanging in the wind, although some areas may not be
as available as in the past, such as travel to your areas to assist in  the
support effort.

I will FAX you a copy of the limited org chart in the morning .......
