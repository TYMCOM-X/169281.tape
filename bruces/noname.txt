Subject:  Conference Call/PICO-Gateway Update

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thomas,

My mistake concerning the conference call, I was thinking on Hongkong time
not California time.  The call will go as scheduled.

As  a quick  update to  the C&W gateway problem on the PICO, we reproduced
the  problem on  the PICO  in our lab, and also a full engine.  It appears
the  problem is related to old-style versus new-style resets, and is being
looked  into by  Scott Wedel from STS Node Code support.   I may have some
more information on the resolution tomorrow.

The  replacement PICO's are  still in  the lab being checked out to insure
we  don't have any  parity errors,  or other hardware failures.  I hope to 
have them on their way by Monday.

I gather  the Buffalo upgrade did  not go very smoothly, I don't know many
of the specifics,  but we were fortunate Jim Stein was involved.

Any problems with the Trustee's PICO??  

I  had one  hell of a time checking out of the hotel on Saturday, it seems
that  with the sale  our old  owner cancelled  my credit  card and I could
not  check out.  Jerks!  I got  to the airport 25 minutes before my flight
left, luckily my bags made it on the flight.  Lake Tahoe was GREAT!

Thank you for the kind words in your OnTymes, but I must honestly day that
I didn't do anything that any other member of NTS would have done.

I'll try and get some more information on the status of PICO firmware, the
gateway, etc., and send you a more detailed OnTyme then.

Best regards,
Bruce
