_____________________________________________________________________

Below is the recap of nodes 2351 and 2374 installed in Buffalo  during 
last  weekend.  A very detail report was sent by Bruce Shepherd.   I'm 
modifying  his  report so that the Bank can have a better  picture  of 
what's going on last weekend and a guideline for future PXL files  set 
up.  Thanks, Bruce.

A brief recap of the problems in bringing up the MMB PXL:

  o  Mismatch  in  BAUDR setting between the  hardware  and   software 
     resulted  in  the  persistent failure  of  BITS   to  load  slots 
     successfully.  (solved on Saturday)

  o  The   SDLC   slot  continually   crashing   with   a   protection 
     violation  once the slot was loaded.  This was the result of  the 
     buffer  management.  (problem has been identified and  fixed  but 
     sdlc  links are still not up.  Might not be BT related  but  will 
     find it out later)

  o  TII sync line to node 2112 shows too many line errors.   Clocking 
     was checked and is fine.  So it's down to the physical line,  the 
     modem   eliminator or  the  sync  board  on  2112 as  the  cause.  
     This can be resolved  when time  permits, but we would  like   to 
     schedule is as soon as possible  to clean  up the  node code link 
     which could potentially cause an intermittent node code crash  of 
     type  xx63 or 264.  This might not be a new problem.  It  may  be 
     there  for quite so time but the link hasn't been monitored  till 
     now.

Area need improvement:

ISIS  tymfile  originally  sent to Charles Averett by   the  GDN   and  
forwarded  to   Bruce was not the same as the code that was eventually 
loaded.   This  did  lead to some confusion on  the  precise  intended 
configuration.   GDN must be more accurate in the ISIS  tymfiles  they 
send to AMUNET to avoid this confusion.

Guideline for future PXL ISIS tymfile:

    o  LBOOT set  to  0 

    o  The NEWARN set to 1 only if consat is 6.40 or above.

    o  ISIS  tymfile  equates not  needed or should be noted with  ISIS
       13.02 and Node Code 5.61 and above are as follows:

          o  SUP    set to 0 (this is the default)
	  o  OLDSUP set to 0 (this is the default)
	  o  REBILD set to 0 (this is the default)

	  o  NCHAIN set to 3 (not required)
	  o  EFFEXC set to 1 (this is the default)

	  o  NLINES is calculated during the assembly
	  o  SILINS is calculated during the assembly
	  o  NLUS0 should no longer  be the  aggregate  of SILINS and
             NLINES as NLINES is  actually recalculated  to be  equal
	     to the total (sync and SIO) lines in node code.

	  o  PHSIZE set to $0 400 (not necessary for 5.61)
	  o  P1SIZE set to $0 800 (not necessary for 5.61)

          o  DMAMAP should be scaled  down to precisely what the slot
	     requires or the additional memory is unusable by anyone.
	     Node code needs only 25Kb, but the DMAMAP calls for 32Kb
	     so we are wasting 7Kb.  The SDLC  slot  only needs  29Kb
	     and we have 40Kb allocated.

          o  To insure  the correct  line  speed  reporting with node
	     code 5.61, the TIILNK macro should have  the line  speed
	     specified.  

          o  For sync lines  always set  NSYNC to $A 8 if only the SP
	     card  is  present, or to $A 16  if both  SP  and  SE are
	     installed.

Please have one of you staff calling me for a sample isis tymfile.  

Merry Christmas
Thomas

Further  to  my  status  updated to you  on  December  23,  SDLC  slot 
continually crashing is fixed.  The root cause was that when more than 
5  lines are configured, very large buffer storage area  is  addressed 
with  a  halfword  store addressing instead of  using  fullword  store 
addressing.   To  enable fullword store addressing, put  the  below  2 
lines in the SDLC tymfile:                 
                         FL   FWBBF
               FWBBF     EQ   1

I  have regenned node 2351 files and save them in ~hsbc/temp.  Do  the 
following to move all files from ~hsbc/temp to ~hsbc/hkbnet:

     1. log into HKBNET
     2. delete/rename all nw2351.* 
     2. CD ../TEMP
     3. MV NW2351.* ../HKBNET

NW2351.TYM   has   been  modified  according   to   Bruce   Shepherd's 
recommendation.  Please use it as a sample tymfile for all your PXLs.  

It  appears there were host numbers conflict in the current SDLC  slot 
hosts  2182-2187  compares to Charles  Averett's  1382-1387.   Charles 
finally  decided  to  cease the set up till the  validations  are  all 
cleared.  

Alright, that's all for now.  Do you have any updates from Charles?

Merry Christmas,
Thomas
