-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
     
David,    
     
In  regards to the PICO  BBU problem, I think we need to approach this at  
the  source of  the problem, not the end result.  The problem with simply  
replacing the  3/4 amp fuse (part number 330003-004) with a 1 amp fuse is  
the increased  risk of  providing 12v  to the PICO  boards, the result of  
which could be fatal to the PCB's. 
     
We have not been informed of any fuse failures outside of the four (4) at  
HSBC Canada  and two  (2) or three (3) isolated cases at HSBC GDN.  There  
are over one-hundred (100)  other units  in the  field  (at  FORD and  in  
Saudi  Arabia)  that are  installed with  BBU's  and we  haven't had  any  
problems  reported on  them.   I have had from two (2) to ten (10) PICO's  
operational in the NTS lab with BBU's and not experienced this failure.    
     
I  am in the  process of checking with MD-CSC  to determine if the PICO's  
that have experienced  the fuse  failures were built in the same batch on  
the chance that we may have seen  a batch  of defective  fuses.   This in  
itself  will  be  difficult  to determine,  but  my  contacts  at CSC are  
checking. 
     
There  are very few  items that could cause the fuse to blow, the primary  
ones being a power  surge into the  PSU or  a defective fuse.  On the off  
chance  that there  is a design flaw somewhere in the BBU module, I would  
like to propose that  should another  HSBC Canada  unit fail  the unit be  
sent back to BT TYMNET San Jose  for testing.   I can arrange  to provide  
a replacement unit for the  failed one.   What we will do with the failed  
unit is turn it over  to NTD Product  Support Engineering for analysis of  
the BBU failure.    
     
I  know this isn't the answer you were looking for but the risk of damage  
to  the PCB's with a 1 amp fuse is not one we care to take at  this time.  
We  have  not  had  a  historical  problem  of BBU failures when they are  
properly adjusted,  and do not feel  that the masking of the symptom with  
the fuse change would be beneficial.    
     
Feel  free to  contact me at  408-922-7585 if there are any problems with  
this approach. 
     
Best regards,  
Bruce

Edward,   
     
From the PICO sent down here  by MDISI there is nothing that points towards
a design flaw anywhere.  The box is in good condition outside of the  fuse,
and the rework done in Canada doesn't appear to be a factor.
     
I  will talk  to some more people from Product Support today, but I suspect
that there is no design problem, as was mentioned to HSBC Canada.  The root
cause  of the  problem is still unknown and I will try some testing here to
blow the fuze in the lab.
     
I  know this isn't  the answer  you need  for the Bank, but at this point I
don't  have a clue  as to what caused the fuses to blow in Canada.  I would
NOT replace all of the fuses that are currently installed, nor would I risk
putting a 1 amp fuse in place of a 3/4 amp fuse.  
     
I  hope to have  some additional  ideas this afternoon and will contact you
when I have more.   
     
As a side note the replacement PICO will be sent out this morning, FINALLY!
We  have had massive problems  getting the necessary sign-offs on the order
from our people here and obviously a PRIORITY 1 shipment has little meaning
to  the order  entry people.   I apologize for  the delay and assure you it
won't happen again.  This WILL change!  
     
That's it for now ...    
     
Best regards   
Bruce

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     
     
Edward,   
     
The  following memorandum  is intended  to  outline  the plan of action BT 
TYMNET National Technical Support (NTS) is undertaking in order to resolve 
the PICO Engine battery backup problem being encountered in Canada.   
     
As  a brief recap  of the problems being encountered the 3/4 amp fuse that 
is contained on  the  Battery  Charging Card (part number 470303-001)  has 
blown on  seven (7) PICO engines  in the  HSBC  Canada network.   The root 
cause of  this fuse failure  is unknown at  this time,  but  replacing the 
fuse  with  another 3/4 amp  fuse has  resolved the  problem.  Each of the 
seven failures has been  at a different location  with no repeat  failures 
encountered  to date.   The end result  of the blown fuse is that the PICO 
engine suffers a hard unrecoverable failure which requires a field service 
dispatch to replace the entire PICO engine.  
     
This  fuse failure is viewed  as a very serious issue to NTS, and although 
we have seen very limited failures outside of Canada (total of five in the 
HSBC GDN over the past two years,  none at US domestic sites  and possibly 
1 in  the Middle East),  we none the less are working towards some form of 
explanation  and resolution.  Of the three (3) PICO engines equipped  with 
BBU's currently up and running in the NTS lab,  I have  not encountered  a 
fuse failure in any  although each  unit has been  operational for over 18 
months.   
     
The  PICO engine sent to NTS from MDISI Canada which experienced the blown 
fuse has been thoroughly checked and the only two abnormalities were: 
     
   o  The PSU was set to 5.08v DC (deviation from recommended 5.10v DC
      is nominal).  
     
   o  Using a digital multimeter to  bypass the fuse and  measure  the
      amps,  they  fluxuated  between  7.8 and 8.3 amps.   This  would
      explain why the fuse blew, but not what caused it.    
     
     
The next step in problem isolation will include the following:   
     
   o  Measurement  of the amps  on known good  BBU modules in  the NTS
      lab  to ascertain if the amps flowing across the fuse are at the
      .75 amp threshold.  Should we be right at the .75  amp threshold
      under  normal operating  conditions and  alternate amp fuse  may
      be necessary (as suggested by MDISI).  
     
   o  Complete audit of the BBU Charging Card to  verify that there is
      no deviation on the specified components.   
     
     
If  neither of  the above  proves fruitful  we will expand the research to 
include additional BT TYMNET members  (developers and Product Support).  I 
would expect to  have some  definitive information on what is occurring by 
the end of this week.  Unfortunately due to a lack  of historical failures 
in the BBU module in the past we  really have not dug very deeply into any 
potential design issues or flaws.  I can assure you  we are digging deeply 
into  this matter  at this  time  to  come  up  with  a resolution that is 
mutually agreeable to HSBC Canada, MDISI and BT TYMNET.
     
In  the meantime I would suggest that postponement of the HSBC Canada plan 
to replace  all .75 amp  fuses in  the PICO  engines until  we are able to 
get a clearer picture of what is happening.  
     
I apologize for the delay in not only sending this update to you, but also 
in  isolating the  problem.   We  are  working  under  very tight manpower 
restrictions and I just have not had adequate time to dig into this  issue 
previously.   I am now  dedicating 100% of my time  on this pressing issue 
and will continue to do so until this is resolved.
     
Best regards,  
Bruce
