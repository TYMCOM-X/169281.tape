ISIS 11.01 PATCH 1
This fixes a boundary value problem for a DDT
write command, when a memory out of bounds condition
fails for just falling on a 64K boundary.

 ISIS-2 version 11 revision 1 Patch 2
 This patch permits originating interface to send the proper
 accounting message toward the network.

ISIS 11.01 PATCH 3
This patch re-enables interrupts during the execution
of the Restart SVC so we don't lose an ATN00 interrupt.
ISIS 11.01 PATCH 4
This patch fixes yet another place where interrupts could be
turned off long enough to lose an ATN00 interrupt
ISIS 11.01 PATCH 5
This fixes the problem that the last trace state for
a process is propigated from session to session.

 ISIS-II version 11.01 Patch file number 6
 This patch is to fix ISIS internal circuit acct. problem
