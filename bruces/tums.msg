 Bruce,

 Thanks...

 I was very frustrated when I worked for BT but I thought they'd improved,but
 I spoke to my ex boss over Christmas and he told me morale was very low at
 my old office.Many of the younger,talented guys are leaving and there is always
 uncertainty about the future of the place.This from a company with profits
 of 3.1 Billion Pounds per year!

 However,I have been dealing with Derek Cotterill recently and he seems very
 professional,and has been explaining the big investment program in Europe.
 Sounds interesting if only there were openings in the UK.

 Due to the impending flotation of MDISI in 1st Quarter 1993 there have
 been many redundancies to improve the earnings per employee quota to impress
 the City and the Merchant Bankers.The official press release stated they were
 all due to the sale of the Cad/Cam business but that was total b******t.
 We've also had our January pay review postponed and leases on cars extended.
 If they were up front and told us we would all have to tighten our belts
 until 1993 we could manage but when it's all done quietly and by the 
 grapevine it pisses you off.

 I have listed the directories that I know to be in existence on System 33
 below:-

 UKSUP
 UKLAB
 UKX25DEV
 UKMICTYM
 UKREPAIR
 HMORGAN

 I have some Unix experience but don't know anything about the code genning
 and loading tools available - is it something I can pick up simply or can I 
 use it as an excuse to get a trip to the States?

 Regards,

 Hywel

Subject: Consat/'O' TID/Network parity 

     
     
    Following is a brief discussion on network parity, as well as
an attempt to describe the proper application for the 'O' terminal    
identifier available in Isis CONSAT version 6.03 and later. 
     
     
    It is helpful to break down network parity into two components,   
data flowing from terminal to host and data from host to terminal.    
For this discussion, terminal interface is a CONSAT and the HIF  
applies to most TYMNET host interfaces. 
     
     
 Terminal --> Host  
     
    The parity of data sent from the terminal will not be altered
 by the CONSAT or through the network. The HIF can generally be set   
 up to modify the parity of data before sending it on to the host,    
 i.e. TYMCOM 'PARITY' macro, X.25 'INPARITY' macro.    
     
     
 Host --> Terminal  
     
    It is in this direction that the parity of data is usually most   
 significant since the terminal or terminal software is generally
 more parity-sensitive than the host software. The parity of the 
 data sent from the host will not be altered by the HIF or through    
 the network, but MAY be acted upon by the CONSAT via special TID
 characters or control characters at login:  
     
    'A' TID - This TID preseves SAVE parity at the CONSAT. Data  
              from host to terminal is not altered (transparent).
     
    'O' TID - This TID forces the CONSAT to output all data to the    
              terminal in SPACE parity. High-order bit is always 0.   
     
    cntl-P entered as a logon character forces the CONSAT to output   
    all data to the terminal in EVEN parity. 
     
     
    Many terminal and PC software packages now support 8 bit data,    
 and set themselves up as 8 bit, no parity when attempting to logon   
 to TYMNET. What this means is that the PC supports an extended char- 
 acter set, sometimes including graphics characters. They expect the  
 standard ASCII characters, which include printable text characters,  
 to have hex values between 0-7F (high-order bit = 0). The characters 
 between 80-FF (high-order bit = 1) are considered the extended  
 character set and may represent some graphic or screen formatting    
 characters.   
     
    The problem these 8-bit users encounter when trying to access
 host computers through TYMNET is that MOST NETWORK GENERATED TEXT    
 MESSAGES ARE SENT IN MARK PARITY (high-order bit = 1). This in- 
 cludes the 'please log in: ' prompt, 'HOST IS ON LINE' and 'call
 connected' banners and Sup generated messages such as 'host shut'.   
 Since these messages have the high-order bit set, they are inter-    
 preted by the 8-bit PC software as part of the extended character    
 set and printed on the users screen as the infamous 'garbage'.  
 Many users currently circumvent this by setting the PC software 
 to 7-bit during logon and switching to 8-bit after connecting to
 the application.   
     
    The 'O' terminal identifier supported in Isis CONSAT version 
 6.03 and later, used in conjunction with HIF modifications, may 
 be a solution to the 'garbage' and 7-bit to 8-bit switching prob-    
 lems. A user set to 8-bits, no parity accessing a 6.03 CONSAT can    
 enter an 'O' TID to cause the CONSAT to force SPACE parity on data   
 sent to the terminal. When the high-order bit is removed from the    
 'please log in: ' and other network generated messages, they can
 be correctly displayed at the PC since they now fall between 0-7F.   
 This is only part of the solution, however, since the user does 
 not want the CONSAT acting on data from the host (where the high-    
 order bit is significant). The host interface must send an ISIS 
 enter transparency message (A8) to the CONSAT when the user has 
 reached the application to return the CONSAT to SAVE (tranparent)    
 parity. The HIF should also convert the messages it might gen-  
 erate during a session ('DATA LOST', 'RESET') to SPACE parity so
 they can be understood by the 8-bit PC package. This functionality   
 is currently available in TYMCOM version 3.01 with the E8BTM    
 subhost option, and in XCOM version 3.01 and 4.03 with patches. 
 It is important to recognize that the 'O' TID is normally used  
 in conjunction with these HIF changes. If the 'O' TID by itself 
 corrects a users garbage problem, then he wants to see ALL data 
 in SPACE parity and needn't be set at 8,N,1 in the first place. 
     
     
    The following summarizes the sequence of events:   
     
    1. User set at 8/N/1.
     
    2. User accesses 6.03 CONSAT, enters 'O' TID. CONSAT is now  
    forcing SPACE parity. User can read network messages.   
     
    3. User builds circuit to HIF supporting the enter trans-    
    parency functionality. HIF sends 'HOST IS ON LINE' or other  
    network banner in SPACE parity, then sends enter transparency
    message (A8) to CONSAT.   
     
    4. CONSAT receives A8, switches to SAVE parity. User can now 
    receive 8-bit data from host.  
     
     
     
    Most access locations presently employ at least one version 6.03  
Isis CONSAT. Any location which employs a version 3.05 Isis CONSAT    
can be upgraded to version 6.03 for 'O' TID support. Solo CONSATs do  
not support 'O' TID and must be evaluated based on port density for   
upgrade to Isis CONSAT version 6.03.

Subject: CANNET PICO Failure 



Edward,   


Good morning ....


When  you  get in  page me on 408-989-3059, so we can talk about the
CANNET PICO dump after the power failure ....

These are the interesting points/questions ....

1.  When the dump was loaded with the no-start-up  option, it shows
    that  slot 0 was HALTED from DDT ... this  is no doubt  why the
    node failed to recover after the power failure.

    The last username in the  slot was  DDT which does NOT have the
    license to halt slots ... so what  happened???   Good question,
    the  log  shows slot loads were occurring and  perhaps the  NCC
    was  doing a slot  load via LOADII  and  accidentially entered
    slot 0 instead of the correct slot ....

2.  When the dump was taken, did it require manual intervention  to
    place  the node into boot???   According to the  dump with slot
    0 halted  the  only way we could have dumped  the node was  for
    someone to manully put it into boot .... can  you check on this
    since it is a key ingredient to the failure.


3.  Can you check  on  what DDT usernames  have the license to halt
    slots ... 

4.  Are there other dumps or problems related to power hit failures
    on PICOs or engines (like 2700)??




Anyway, check on these questions and give me a page,

Bruce

 Bruce,

 I have just resigned from McDonnell Douglas as I've been offered the
 Communications Manager position with a company called Travis Perkins.The
 basic salary is significantly higher and comes with the perks you would expect
 from such a position such as car,private medical care,and participation in the
 lucrative management bonus scheme.Even if further opportunities within the
 company do not arise in future it will still be a good thing to list on my CV.

 I may still have access to Tymnet in the short term,however,as they currently
 have a 240 node subnet,but my brief will be to migrate to an X.25 and LAN
 based solution within a year.

 Thank you for your support and friendship over the last few years and I wish
 you well in the future.If you are ever in the UK again you will always be very
 welcome to stay and use my place as a base.

 Once again,all the best to you and the family.

 Regards,

 Hywel

SUBJECT         : SVC throughput class & PVC throughput class
 
DATE            : April 30, 1992
 
............................................................
 
 
 
===========================================================
 
1. SVC Throughput Class
 
         SDLC SVC throughput class is defined by the statement
 
   SVC.TCLASS(t, r). Both values are 2 decimal digits ranging from
 
   03 to 12:
 
         03 = 75   baud            08 = 2400  baud
         04 = 150  baud            09 = 4800  baud
         05 = 300  baud            10 = 9600  baud
         06 = 600  baud            11 = 19200 baud
         07 = 1200 baud            12 = 48000 baud
 
   If the statement SVC.CLASS is not defined, the line speed will be used
 
   to determine the throughput class:
 
         Let TRTP = (line speed) / 2400 (in decimal)
             Throughput class = 0C  if TRTP > 8
                                0B  if TRTP = 8, 7, 6, 5
                                0A  if TRTP = 4, 3
                                09  if TRTP = 2
                                08  if TRTP = 1
                                07  if TRTP = 0
             Throughput class = 0A  if both line speed and SVC.CLASS are
                                       not defined.
 
   This statement defines the default throughput class negotiation value
 
   to be used during negotiation and circuit building:
 
      a. After receiving pseudo needle (B2) ISIS message, SVC outgoing
 
         line sends out username with a gouging level corresponding to
 
         to the defined throughput (t). If throughput class is larger
 
         than 9, the gouging level is 'D' (84). Otherwise the gouging
 
         level is 'C' (83).
 
      b. After receiving IIX, SVC outgoing line may send throughput class
 
         negotiation with the value (t,r) via IIX C08D message.
 
      c. After receiving IIX C08D message, the SCV incoming line negotiates
 
         the throughput class value down to the smaller value of throughput
 
         class defined by the statement SVC.TCLASS and the throughput class
 
         value within the IIX C08D message. This smaller value will be
 
         returned to caller via IIX C092 (call accept) message.
 
2. PVC Throughput Class
 
         PVC throughput class is defined by the statement PVC.RTPUT(t) and
 
   PVC.TTPUT(t). The same algorithm on (item 1.) is applied if these
 
   statements and/or line speed are not defined.
 
         The throughput call values are used when:
 
      a. PVC outline sends username to SUP. The gouging level is determined
 
         by the statement PVC.TTPUT(t). (same algorithm on (item 1.a.) is
 
         used.)
 
      b. PVC outline sends PVC request IIX C099 message.
 
      c. PVC inline receives IIX PVC request. The throughput values within
 
         the PVC request are compared with the throughput class values
 
         defined on this line. If there is no match, the PVC request will
 
         then be rejected.

We are working to clean up some unused OnTyme IDS.  Yours is currently
configured to have your messages forwarded from OnTyme through the TUMS
gateway to your Unix ID.  If you desire to maintain your OnTyme ID and
this gateway, please respond to Norman Smith via Dialcom: NORMAN, or
OnTyme ACS.N/SMITH, or telephone 408-922-6376.

Otherwise, your OnTyme ID and the associated gateway connection will be
removed in approximately three weeks.

Thanks for your assistance in removing unnecessary IDS and the associated
overhead of the gateway.

_____________________________________________________________________

Further to my previous requested dated August 3, as per your  request, 
I would like to describe the set up and the objective in details.

Bruce  Shepherd  of  NTS has arranged a  group  of  technical  people, 
including  BITS developers, to on-line trouble shoot, data  collection 
and isolate the root cause of this long outstanding issue.  There  are 
different practice in GNS public network.  

It's  more  practical  to  have  the  developers  to  feel  the   real 
environment, i.e. dumping a node in HSBCNET's network by going through 
several nodes.  Though the problem MAY be simulated in BTHK's LAB, the 
internodal hop doesn't truly reflect the Bank's situation.

Here is what Bruce has arranged:

o    A Pico Engine in CANNET with a breakout box or scope on the  line 
     between the neighbor and the Pico.  This spare Pico will be  used 
     as  the test hardware which is NOT a production node.  Bruce  has 
     talked  with  Edward Tam and he is agreeable to  assist  in  this 
     testing and can provide the PICO.

o    BITS developers will be onsite and so as STS BITS support.  Bruce 
     is  the coordinator and will be there from beginning to  end.   I 
     shall be standby.  I'll turn on portable phone at all time during 
     the test period.  Number is 94919687 during non-office hours.  

o    Simulation  schedule  is Wednesday Aug-5 at 9:00  a.m.  San  Jose 
     time, i.e. Thursday Aug-6 at 0:00 a.m. HKTime.

o    Dump will be taken via BTHKSUN.

Below are what he needs:

o    Access to the BTHKSUN (already done by BTHK)

o    Username  to  access PROBE in HSBC network.  They  need  this  to 
     trace the dump/load circuit so they know what the path is  during 
     any dump performed

o    Username to access DDT on any node in HSBC network, so when  they 
     initiate a dump, get the circuit path from PROBE.

o    DLOAD password for node dump.

o    Username/password to be used to for the gateway connections  from 
     BTHK LAB to HSBC network.  (done by BTHK)

o    Gateway  hosts information of GNS to BTHKLAB, BTHKLAB to  HSBCNET 
     and vice versa.  (done by BTHK)

Here is what I propose:

o    Bruce will call in for the above access.

o    When done, Bruce will call in for access termination

Truly  understand the security issue lies in here.  We  guarantee  our 
professionalism  of this set up and we certainly make aware of to  all 
involved of HSBC's security of its network.  

Regards,
Thomas

Further to our conversation this afternoon, Bruce Shepherd of NTS  has 
arranged with Edward Tam and his technical force to simulate the  case 
and  on-line  (hopefully)  isolate the cause of the  delays.   A  Pico 
Engine in CANNET with a breakout box or scope on the line between  the 
neighbor  and  the Pico.  The arrangement is scheduled on  the  coming 
Wednesday, August 5th at 9:00 a.m. CATime.  

HSBCNet DDT and PROBE access are necessary.  BT (either Bruce or BTHK) 
will call in to NCC for the above access.  Please provide accordingly.

Subject:  HSBC BITS  Dumping Tests

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

K N,

I  just wanted to assure  HSBC that I am fully aware of the good faith shown
by  the Bank  in  order  for  BTNA to do some "real-world" BITS  testing  in
attempting to isolate the cause of the extremely long times  to  dump a  1Mb
engine.

Although the decision to allow us this access may not have been granted yet,
I  can assure  you the  visibility  of the problem can be no greater than to
have our development staff see first  hand  the length  of  time in the HSBC
network  and not  in a truncated lab environment.  I have raised these exact
same issues in  regards to the  dumping in the public network (who have just
recently embarked upon providing dumps via BITS)  and  in  the NTS lab.   We
have made  dramatic  improvements (the  very first PXL dumps took 4+ hours),
but  we still  have a LONG way to go and using your network as the benchmark
is more than I could  hope for in  bringing this  issue  to the attention of
the  BITS development staff.  I can assure you that should we be granted the
use of HSBC's network we will work with all due respect and caution.

I  am also aware  that  by  giving  me access to select and  privileged HSBC
network  usernames security  issues are  extremely evident,  but  I can also
assure you that I am completely aware  of the  faith you would placed in our
hands  and I can guarantee you caution will be our primary concern.   No one
outside  of myself will be aware  of  these passwords  as  I will personally
perform each  dump to insure that only a bare minimum of personnel have this
knowledge.  I will contact the NCC when the testing is to begin and end.

Our  goal in the exercise  tomorrow is  not to provide a magical fix, but to
get  to the  root cause (be it the BITS  program or some peripheral  module)
and  resolve it to HSBC's satisfaction, not BTNA's but HSBC's.  It must meet
your satisfaction or the problem is not resolved.

As  always BTNA  respects and appreciates  the  patience and assistance HSBC
continues  to  provide us when we do not meet proper levels of  performance.
The  fault in  this problem  is not within BTHK as they have performed every
step of  the problem identification and followed the procedures available to
them.   The fault lies  within the BTNA  process where  we are not always as
receptive to private  network  customers as we  should be,  but we do listen
even  if we do not always act rapidly enough.  This issue will be a priority
one issue from our perspective until it is  resolved.  We do have all of the
parties  necessary to determine the cause as  I continue  to have  excellent
support  from  our  BITS  development staff, Product Marketing managers  and
the CMF/CMS/BITS support personnel.  As for me, I am simply coordinating the
efforts of everyone else and liaising between BTHK and BTNA.

Again  I  do appreciate your patience and  the  trust you place in us, and I
will assure you no abuses will occur.

Best regards,
Bruce
