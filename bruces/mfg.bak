Subject:  PICO Firmware Order

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With  the finalization of  the  ECO that  releases  PICO engine  firmware
version 2.0, it is now imperative that the  order I placed  with Francine
Blas  be started  immediately.   At this  point the  order  may  not have
gone into  the IOES system yet  due  to  the pending release  of the ECO. 
The necessary information for the PICO firmware is as follows:

    PICO Engine PROM Set  -  Part number 380074-001
    
       Each set consists of 2 EPROMS:
       
          EVEN  -  Part number 790278-010 (checksum 408173)
          ODD   -  Part number 790279-010 (checksum 513EAA)

       The EPROM used is part number 370712-001  IC EPROM 512K 
       (the TOSHIBA part number is TMM2751D-20)

       
The  ECO releasing  the firmware  (ECO 90-233)  should  be  completed  by
tomorrow and if necessary a  master set  of firmware can be obtained from
Doug Rupe, Manager of Product Support.

The amount of the order can be simplified as follows:

     HSBC GND		=    26 sets
     HSBC Canada	=    76 sets
     BTSF Saudi Arabia  =    80 sets
     
                  Total     182 sets

Of  the order  the most critical  is the 26 sets to the Hongkong Shanghai
Baning  Corporation  Global  Data  Network  (world wide locations).   The
next most critical is the HSBC Canadian expansion.

A  brief synopsis of the the problem is that HSBC GDN sites experience  a
failure  that  causes the entire PICO engine to drop out  of the  network
and requires  manual intervention to recover.  In all HSBC GDN  sites the
PICO is at locations  that are not  manned after  hours or  on  weekends.
A bug was found in the  firmware (dating to the original PICO predecessor 
- the TSI)  which  under  limited circumstances  causes  a channel  to be
redefined  as  a 4800  baud  async  channel regardless  of  the  original
intended configuration.   Unfortunately, the channel that is reconfigured
happens to be the  ONLY  channel that  the PICO  is capable  of using for
SYNC downline loads, and  naturally is the the only TII  link in the bulk
of the HSBC sites.

Additionally, this problem  has visibility at the very top levels of HSBC
and  BT TYMNET management.   The decision to replace the firmware has the
approval of upper management  from BT TYMNET, and we are now committed to
a  schedule of  upgrading the  HSBC GDN  sites within  the next four  (4)
weeks.   This schedule was received via Ontyme today, and obviously  with
the ECO pending the  field test of  the firmware in Hong Kong and  Manila
we were unable to insure a greater lead time.

With  this in mind,  I need to have the firmware (26 sets) ready to  ship
to  Hong Kong within  the next week.   I understand that  there may  be a
limited supply of  the blank EPROMS,  and  in this case  they need  to be
procured in the most expeditious manner  so as to meet the schedule  that
has been presented to HSBC.

If  there are any problems  with this  request or schedule,  feel free to
contact  myself (ext 7585),  Tim  Kochmann or Don Johnson.   In  order to
avoid any additional delays or confusion, I have copied  both  Bill Euske
and Bob  Tomasi on  this memorandum,  both of  whom are  involved in this
effort to correct the problem at HSBC.
