1.3  PXL ARCHITECTURE.

The  PXL is  designed to  be a phased in replacement for the PICO engine and
offers  the  same compatibility  as other members of the XL hardware family.
Because  the  MAC  V  employs  a  different  virtual  to  physical   address
translation format,  it is  NOT  compatible  with  any  previously  released
software.  MAC V addressing is a  24-bit address  compared  with  the 20-bit
address from previous MAC version.

Essentially  the PXL is a repackaging of the Compact XL into a significantly
smaller  package.  PXL-I has 1 megabyte of memory and communications options
equivalent  to a  single SIO motherboard, 8 standard sync ports and up to 32
standard  low speed  async ports depending upon the selected  configuration.
The PXL utilizes  logic cell  arrays and  surface mount technology to reduce
real  estate  and  power  consumption.  There  is  NO parity error detection
circuitry on the PXL-I.


2.  CODE GENERATION.

  ISIS TYMFILE ADDITIONS:

     o  MACHNS Macro   -  Machine level  definition macro.   The only option
        currently  implemented is  MAC type.   The  structure  of the MACHNS
	macro is as follows:

             MACHNS(type,cpu,mac)

	     where
               type = hardware type  [DEFAULT is ENGINE]
	              (ENGINE, MINI, MICRO, TSI, PICO,HDLC,HSLCTMI)
               cpu  = CPU type (CPU2,CPU3 or CPU4)  [DEFAULT is CPU3]
	       mac  = Relocation hardware (valid only on ENGINE and MINI)
	              (MAC2, MAC3 or MAC5)   [DEFAULT is MAC2]

        All three options can be included in the macro statement for clarity
	even  though the  only  one  currently impacting the code is the MAC
	type.

     o  ZITEL Equate     -  Indicates whether MAC I or greater  is installed
        on machine.   For MAC V hardware ZITEL  MUST be  set  to  0 or bogus
	bad MAC set  crashes are possible.   Conditional  assembly  switches
	within ISIS 13.0x insure that the expanded  MAC register  usage (256
	registers) is available  but other  areas of  code relating to ZITEL
	semiconductor  memory is not  included.   The ZITEL equate structure
	is:

	    ZITEL	EQ	0	: Not required for MAC 5


     o  NEWARN Equate  -  Indicates whether the  new  Async  ring  structure
        and Async connect  I/O  SVC  is  to  be  used.   Default  value is 0
	(not using the  new async driver/SVC).  A value of 1 enables the new
	Async code.  The NEWARN equate construct is:

	    NEWARN	EQ	1	: Enable NEW ASYNC structure

        Any async application slot needs to have a corresponding flag set to
	match the NEWARN equate.  For CONSAT 11.x  this is done by  the flag
	NEWASY being  set to 0 or 1  according to the  NEWARN value.  CONSAT
	6.40 REQUIRES  that  NEWARN  be  set  to 1 only.  The current TYMCOM
	implementation REQUIRES that NEWARN be  set to 0, so the TYMCOM will
	only work with CONSAT 6.05 and is incompatible with CONSAT 6.40.

     o  SPAM Equate -  Indicates whether the System  Performance and Monitor
        tool is enabled.  It is not recommended that SPAM be  always enabled
        as  the  CPU  performance  loses  approximately  3-5% when  SPAM  is
	enabled.  The SPAM equate construct is:

	    SPAM	EQ	0	: Disable SPAM monitoring tool

     o  EE.BP Equate - Indicates that end-to-end bit array backpressuring is
        enabled in ISIS.   Most application  slots do not use the TOISIS and
	FRISIS bits  arrays for  backpressure,  but  some still  so (such as
	PBT, PBH, and CMT).   It  is recommended  that this equate be set to
	1  regardless of  the applications  running in the node.  The  EE.BP
	equate construct is:

            EE.BP	EQ	1	: Enable end-to-end backpressuring

     o  LOG.II Equate - Indicates  that the node is or is not a LOG II node.
        The ISIS 13.02 default  is 1 indicating a LOG II node,  and  any PXL
	in a LOG I network  may  have circuit  rebuild problems  unless this
	equate is set to 0.  The LOG.II equate construct is:

            LOG.II      EQ      0       : Not a LOG II node

     o  SLOT Macro     -  A slot level macro  to  specify  the  SLOT number.
        The SLOT macro construct is:

	    SLOT(number)

	    where number = is the the slot number

     o  DMAMAP Macro   -  A slot level  macro to  specify  the slot  DMA are
        which is relocated to low core memory.   This macro is REQUIRED only
	for slots with DMA (SIO) devices.  The DMAMAP macro construct is:

            DMAMAP(mem)

	    where mem = is the decimal value of Kmemory reserved for DMA.

        This value should  be set  to the  specified amount as determined by
	the  application  slot generation.   Any  memory  above  the  ACTUAL
	amount required by  the application  code is  unusable and therefore
	wasted.   A  basic  rule  of size  estimation is  9Kb per DMA  (SIO)
	line.

	If  NO DMA is configured  for  an individual  slot the  DMAMAP macro
	must NOT be included in the slot definition -  a DMAMAP(0) statement
	will reserve 64Kb of memory for DMA relocation.

        Determining this value can be tricky, but a general rule of thumb is
	to set this value  as 8*number-of-SIO-lines.  Most applications will
	specify in the  slot  gen how  much DMA  memory is required, but not
	all  of them.  Those that specify  the DMA required will print a gen
	summary outlining the  conventional and DMA memory requirements, but
	those that  do not  print this  summary (CONSAT 6.40), the amount of
	memory required  does not  include the DMA estimate.  In general the
	setting of the slot core size is as follows:

              slot-core-size = conventional-memory  +  dma-memory

        For  node code , the optimal DMA  memory  is  included in the output
	for the  optimal  memory total,  so the  optimal memory value is the
	value used for slot-core-size.


  ISIS GOODGUY LIST MODIFICATION:

     o  A new license has been added to the goodguy list for ISIS that  will
        allow a DDT user to issue newly  restricted DDT  commands (ie: Halt,
	Freeze, Thaw, Boot,  Enter Debug, Leave Debug).  This license is L.L
	and is  required for  any user to issue the "H" command.   Those DDT
	users without the L.L license can still issue the ?HALT command.


  CODE GENERATION:

  In  addition to  the  above version of code the command line for generating
  code for the PXL is the following:

      gemini%nad -v -c cmd -m cmd.log

      where
        -v          = the MAC V switch
	-c cmd      = the name of the commands file to assemble
	-m cmd.log  = the name of the file to generate the assembly log into.

  Or the standard "GEN" command may be used with a MAC V flag:

	delta%gen -v

  Application specific parameters required:

    ISIS and Node Code use the MACHNS macro in the tymfile.

    CONSAT 6.40 - uses a MACV equate statement.  If set  to  1  then MAC  V
      conditional assembly is performed.  Only the NEW async ring structure
      is supported in CONSAT 6.40,  so NEWARN must be  set to 1 in the ISIS
      tymfile.  The MACV equate structure is as follows:

		MACV	EQ	1	: MAC V flag

    XCOM 4.05 - only requires the "-v" option during assembly.

    PBT  17.02 - uses a MACV equate statement.  If set  to  1  then  MAC  V
      conditional assembly is performed.


    Check the latest releases of applications code as numerous products are
    being released or will soon be released with MAC V support.


  There is  NO plan  to have  MAC V  code management  be available on the PDP
  systems.  This is due to  the amount  of work  required to make NAD, MERLIN
  LOADII and ELF  compatible  with  the  MAC V addressing.  As  a result  all
  MAC V code management is required to be done under the UNIX umbrella.
  

  
CONSOLE LOCKING:

  The  front  console  locking mechanism  is built  into the  console  keypad
  and is invoked via a 3 key sequence:

       CONSOLE LOCKING:

          BLANK-D-1

       CONSOLE UNLOCKING:

          BLANK-E-1

  Currently  the console  will  initially  comes  up  LOCKED.  Once UNLOCKED
  any system  reset  (boot or  power recycle)  will cause  the console to be
  once again LOCKED.

3.  CONFIGURATION GUIDELINES.

The bus slots on the PXL look as follows:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      
        |   |  |______________||______________|
	|   |         |                |
	|   |         |                |
	|   |         |                 ----------  NON-DMA expansion
	|   |          ---------------------------  DMA expansion
	|    -------------------------------------  Reserved for TTY/V.24
	 -----------------------------------------  Reserved for SIO MB



    Slot 0:  PXL-1  requires  that  slot  0  be  reserved  for  the   SIO 
             Motherboard  card.   PXL-2  will  have the  functionality of
	     the SIO motherboard  rolled down  to  the  main  motherboard
	     of the PXL.

    Slot 1:  Reserved for the SCV24 card which contains the multifunction
             logic and two (2) V.24 ports.  These  V.24 ports can be used
	     for any application (node code, X.25,  SDLC, etc).   This is
	     considered one of the 5 DMA capable slots.

    Slot 2 - Slot 5:
             Are the ONLY  DMA capable  expansion  slots.   These can run
	     any combination of OCL, V.24, V.35 or SIO ASYNC  cards.  The
	     restriction is the current SIO motherboard  guidelines.   In
	     addition, the non-SIO async cards can run in these slots.

    Slot 6 - Slot 9: 
             Are NON-DMA capable  expansion slots.   These  slots can  be
	     configured for ASYNC or a MAXIMUM of 8 sync ports.  The sync
	     ports can ONLY be configured to run in these four slots.

    NOTE:    Bus allocations are configured in PAIRS (for the primary and
             secondary  option cards - AP/AE and SP/SE).  The PAIR groups
	     are defined as follows:

		   0 and 1  RESERVED
	           2 and 3
		   4 and 5
		   6 and 7
		   8 and 9

             When a PRIMARY  card (AP/SP) is installed in EITHER bus slot
	     of a pair, it will control  the EXPANSION card in the  other
	     bus  slot of the SAME pair.   An example of this would  be a
	     configuration were primary and extender card options look as
	     follows:

                 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
                 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		          ------- ------- ------- -------
                             |       |       |       |
                             |       |       |        ---  fourth pair
                             |       |        -----------  third  pair
                             |        -------------------  second pair
                              ---------------------------  first  pair


                 where

		    OCL in slot 2  
		    AP  in slot 3     controlls itself only (no AE card)

		    AE  in slot 4     controlled by AP in slot 5
		    AP  in slot 5

		    AP  in slot 6
		    AE  in slot 7     controlled by AP in slot 6

		    AE  in slot 8     controlled by AP in slot 9
                    AP  in slot 9

		 
	     



The rule of thumb for hardware configurations (at this time) are as follows:


   SYNC:  Maximum of 8 ports (4 on sync primary card, 4 on sync expansion
          card).  Must be installed in  slots 6-9.   This is the standard
	  sync available on the engine.  Available at speeds up to 19.2K.
	  Maximum  sustainable SYNC  speed (aggregate CPS)  is  19200 CPS
	  (each 19.2K  line has a  value of  2400 CPS  for a  total  of 8
	  lines  at 19.2K).   The sync  ports for the PXL are designed to
	  be referenced as the  NON-PRIMITIVE ports  (ports which provide
	  the full range of signals).  This is the reason for restricting
	  the  number  of  sync  ports  to 8 as  the  8  configurable are
	  defined as follows:


	      Physical port	Logical Port
	      -------- ----     ------- ----

	            0		      2
		    1                 3
		    2                 6
		    3                 7
		    4                10
		    5                11
		    6                14
		    7                15

          Therefore, the NSYNC value in the TYMFILE must be set to 16 if
	  all 8 sync ports are active.



   ASYNC: Maximum of 28 ports  (configurable as 4 per primary  card [AP],
          4 per expansion  card [AE]), or 48 ports [configurable as 8 per
	  AL8 card).    Can be  installed  in  ANY  slots  (2-9).    This
	  is the  standard async  available on the engine.   Available at
	  50-1200  with BAUDR  set to  0 (low  speed)  and  50-4800  with
	DR set to 2 (high speed).  Maximum sustainable ASYNC thruput
	  (aggregate CPS)  is  4200-4500 CPS,  with  no more  than  10 PC
	  file transfers simultaneously.



   SIO:   Follows CFB 168 (published SIO Configuration Guidelines):

          V.24  lines can be  any  speed up to  19200 BPS (some examples:
	  4800, 9600, 14400, 19200).   However, the configurations  below
	  treat all speeds the same!   (Example: You can NOT trade 1 19.2
	  for 2 9.6 lines.)

          SIO ASYNC lines can be run at any selectable speed (50-9600).


          Valid  configurations  are listed in order of priorities.  Pick
	  one  configuration.

	  THESE GUIDELINES ENCOMPASS  ALL SIO PORTS  (SVC24 PORTS ARE SIO
	  AND THEREFORE FALL UNDER THESE GUIDELINES).

	  NO OTHER CONFIGURATIONS WILL BE SUPPORTED!


	     #1   2x72KB (V.35)

	     #2   3x64KB (V.35)

The rule of thumb for software configurations (at this time) are as follows:

1.  Async rotory node design:

    Maximum Node CPS Rate = 3800 Bytes Per Second (1900 IN + 1900 OUT)

    Standard LOW  speed Async:  28 ports (with AP/AE combinations)
                                48 ports (with AL8 daughtercards)
				
    Standard HIGH speed Async:  28 ports (with AP/AE combinations)
                                48 ports (with AL8 daughtercards)

    SIO Async:  16 ports


    Combination of SIO and STANDARD Async:
        4 SIO Async ports
       16 Standard Async ports (high low speed)


    All of the above are general numbers, the actual configuration will
    depend ENTIRELY upon the network connectivity.  NO other interfaces
    should be configured on the PXL besides the CONSAT.




2.  ISIS Switcher node design:

    Follows  the SIO  configuration guidelines, coupled with  the SYNC
    configuration maximums.




3.  ISIS Interface node design:

    A reasonable high speed port configuration would seem to be:

	Maximum Number of Async Ports             = 16
	Maximum Number of SIO-Async Ports         = 4
	Maximum Number of X.25 Dial-Up Interfaces = 2


    A caution here is to insure  that the  CPU  and I/O capacities are
    not overloaded.  It is possible  to maximize  the I/O and overload
    the CPU simultaneously.


4.  CPS/Packets Per Second:

    The CPS and packets per  second rate  for the  PXL is based on the
    following ESTIMATES:

       SWITCHER  CPS Rate:  12,000 to 16,000 
       INTERFACE CPS Rate:   6,000 to  8,000

       Packet Size:         128 bytes


       SWITCHER  packets per second =  93-125
       INTERFACE packets per second =  46- 62


    NOTE: These are ESTIMATES as there is no hard and fast performance
          statistics on the PXL.

4.1.1  SIO Port addressing.

All  daughtercards follow  the same  port address method using a 16 position
dial to set the motherboard port addressing:

    As viewed from the top down:

    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |       C                                                           |
    |     +---+                                                         |
    |   8 |   | 0							|
    |     +---+								|
    |       4                                                           |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

    where:

       0   =  SIO ports addressed as 0,1
       1   =  SIO ports addressed as 2,3
       2   =  SIO ports addressed as 4,5
       3   =  SIO ports addressed as 6,7
       4   =  SIO ports addressed as 8,9
       5   =  SIO ports addressed as A,B
       6   =  SIO ports addressed as C,D
       7   =  SIO ports addressed as E,F
       8-F =  SIO ports DISABLED


    NOTE:  Any SIO port pair not in use should have the address switch
           set to one of the DISABLED positions (8-F).




STAKE JUMPER PIN ORIENTATION.

The  orientation  of pin 1 on ALL  stake jumpers can  be confusing,  but a
quick check on the  soldered side of  the PCB will  reveal the location of
pin 1 by the SQUARE solder connection.




TERMINOLOGY

For  the following  sections the  enabling or disabling of options can be
referenced as follows:


     DISABLED  =  OPEN    =  OFF  =  0
     ENABLED   =  CLOSED  =  ON   =  1







4.1.2  PXL Basic System.

The  PXL basic  system consists of three main components: PXL motherboard,
SIO motherboard and SCV24 card.

The  PXL  motherboard  is  the  equivalent  of  the  standard  engine CPU,
ROM & I/O,  MAC and  MEMORY boards combined.   The PXL is functionally the
same as a CPU II and MAC III at 10 Mhz.

The SIO motherboard which resides in  dedicated slot 0 of the PXL bus is a
full size  card (3.5 inches high by 10.00 inches  long) and  contains  the
equivalent of a standard engine SIO motherboard.

The  SCV24 is also a full size card (3.5 inches high by 10.00 inches long)
and is the equivalent of the standard engine Multifunction card and an old
style SIO V.24 daughtercard (2 V.24 ports).

All other options cards, except the SP (Sync Primary) are half size  cards
(3.5 inches high by 5.5 inches long).   The  SP card is a  full size  card
measuring 3.5 inches high by 10.00 inches long.


4.1.3  SCV24  [470359-001]

The SCV24 combines the standard engine Multifunction card with a Old Style
SIO  V.24 two (2) port  daughtercard.   

Pin 1 on ALL stake jumpers can be determined by looking on the solder side
of the SCV24 and finding the SQUARE solder joint which is pin 1.

A simplified diagram of the SCV24 daughtercard is as follows:

4.2.2.B  SV35 CARD  [470370-001]     REV B  ONLY

***  NOTE:  VERIFY THE REV LEVEL ON THE SV35 BOARD IS A REV B  AND NOT A
            REV D  -  THE THE SCV35 IS A REV D BOARD USE THE   STRAPPING
	    OUTLINED IN SECTION 4.2.2.D FOR THAT BOARD (NEXT SECTION).

The  SV35 PXL  daughtercard is  the  equivalent  of  the  SIO V.35 OLD-STYLE
daughtercard on the  standard engine.  The SV35 provides 2 ports capable  of
running up to 72Kb  per port.

The  SV35 is capable  of providing  both primary and  secondary transmit and
receive clocks at 56Kb.  These are  on-board [INTERNAL] clocks  and  require
one  of the following  options if a hardwire connection is desired:

    o  The PXL and the neighbor to provide TRANSMIT  clocks (primary  and
       secondary) and a crossover cable in between.

    o  Use  of  a  V.35 crossover  cable which does not bridge any clocks,
       but the PXL provides both primary and secondary clocking.

NOTE:  The PXL V.35 cable (part number 160602-TAB DB-15 to Winchester) has
       a shroud that is too large to connect to some modems and requires a
       pigtail  cable  to connect cleanly.   This  shroud is necessary for
       FCC compliance  and is  not a  design oversight.  The pigtail cable
       necessary is part number 160615-TAB.

Pin 1  on ALL  stake jumpers can be determined by looking on the solder side
of the SV35 and finding the SQUARE solder joint which is pin 1.
				       

A simplified diagram of the SV35 daughtercard is as follows:

4.2.5  SP/SE  [SP 470360-001  -  SE  470362-001]

The SP/SE PXL daughtercards are the equivalent of the standard  Engine  sync
motherboard.   The SP/SE  daughtercards provide  a  combined 8 ports of sync
access (speeds to 19.2K bps).  A MAXIMUM of  1 SP and 1 SE can be configured
and supported in a single PXL.   The SP/SE  provide  a full  set  of  RS-232
signals  (non-primitive  ports)  and  therefore  the  8 ports  available are
viewed  from ISIS  as a  full 16  port sync  board (primitive ports are  not
available).   The SP board is a full size  daughtercard  with  the logic  to
maintain  8  ports,  while  the  SE  daughtercard  is a half-size  card with
only the drivers for 4 ports.

See the Configuration Guidelines for PXL bus slot allocations.

A simplified diagram of the SP and SE  daughtercards is as follows:

4.2.6  AP/AE   [AP  470361-001  -  AE  470365-001]

The AP/AE PXL daughtercards are the equivalent of the standard  Engine async
motherboard.   The AP/AE  daughtercards provide  a  combined 8 ports of  low
access  (50-4800  baud).    A  MAXIMUM  of  32 async ports (4 AP/AE)  can be
configured   on  the  PXL  when  using  the  AP  and  AE  cards.    See  the
Configuration Guidelines  section at the  beginning of this document for PXL
bus slot allocations.

Each  card  is a half-size  card,  with the AP daughtercard  containing  the
logic  to  maintain  8  ports,  while  the AE  daughtercard  card with  only
the drivers for 4 ports.

If the AP card is installed the ports are active, there is no way to have an
AP card installed but the ports disabled (as with the SIO option cards).

A simplified diagram of the async cards is as follows:

The  E1 jumper on the  AP daughtercard  [470361-001] is  used to specify the
async board  addressing used by ISIS and to designate the port range for the
AP/AE boards (s).   Each AP board controls the addressing for itself and one
(1) AE (if necessary).  As viewed from the top down the  E1 jumper is set as
follows:

    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |     3 1                                                      PORT |
    |     4 2                                                CONNECTORS |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

	 where:

	   1-2 OPEN   and 3-4   OPEN:  Async MB address 0C1 ports 8-15
	   1-2 CLOSED and 3-4   OPEN:  Async MB address 0C1 ports 0- 7
	   1-2 OPEN   and 3-4 CLOSED:  Async MB address 0C5 ports 8-15
	   1-2 CLOSED and 3-4 CLOSED:  Async MB address 0C5 ports 0- 7

	   OPEN - No jumper  installed      CLOSED - Jumper installed


Essentially the two sets of pin (1-2 and 3-4) can be viewed as follows:

   1-2  Refers to the group of 8 ports:

        1-2 OPEN   refers to the HIGHER group of 8 (ports 8-15)
	1-2 CLOSED refers to the LOWER  group of 8 (ports 0- 7)

   3-4  Refers to the board base address:

        3-4 OPEN   refers to address C1  [ISIS A.REF(0)]
	3-4 CLOSED refers to address C5  [ISIS A.REF(1)]



The RECOMMENDED configuration for a  28 port ASYNC  CONSAT or  TYMCOM  is as
follows:

           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
           | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |

			|   |        ----------- Jumper 1-2 OPEN

			|    ------------------- Jumper 1-2 CLOSED
			|                               3-4 CLOSED
			|
			 ----------------------- Jumper 1-2 OPEN
			                                3-4 CLOSED




From  the ISIS  perspective there  are 32  ports or  2 ISIS A.REF (0 AND 1),
but there  are actually on 28 PHYSICAL ports.   ISIS makes no destinction of
ports in anything other than groups of 16.


In the above recommended configuration the physical ports look as follows:

           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
           | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |

	            OCL AP  AP  AE  AP  AE  AP  AE
		        |   |   |   |   |   |   |
			|   |   |   |   |    ------  Ports  0-7
			|   |   |   |   |
			|   |   |    --------------  Ports  8-15
			|   |   |
			|    ----------------------  Ports 16-24
			|
			 --------------------------  Ports 25-28

It should be noted that no matter what sequence the AP boards are installed
there  will be  a gap  of four (4) non-existent  ports, these  ports can be
configured at the end of the rotary or in the first group of 16.

all of the logic to  drive 8  ports and  uses the standard PSM  ASYNC 50-pin
8-by breakout cable.  The 8-by  breakout (octopus) cable  used with  the AL8
card is part number 160158-TAB Rev M.

No  more  than  48  ports  should  be  configured  on  the   PXL  under  any
circumstances.

A simplified diagram of the AL8 daughtercard is as follows:

5.  INSTALLATION AND TROUBLESHOOTING.

The following section  will describe  the installation process and note some
on-site troubleshooting that can be performed.

5.1  INSTALLATION.

1.  Visually inspect the shipping container, noting any damage to it.

2.  Remove the PXL from the shipping container.   Remove the  top cover  and
inspect the components for any possible damage during shipping.

3.  Power Backup option installation.  This section is only required  if the
power backup option is separate  from the PXL,  or  to be  retrofitted to an
existing PXL.

    o  Verify that all components of the power backup kit are present:

       o  Power Backup PCB - part number 470392-001
       o  Cable assembly   - part number 160641-001
       o  Installation hardware:
          o  4 spacers - part number 210001-411
	  o  8 screws  - part number 210205-004

       If all  components are  not present,  do not continue with the Power
       Backup installation.  

    o  If this is a retrofit insure that the PXL  is powered  off  and  the
       AC power cord is disconnected.

    o  Disconnect  the  3  cables  connecting   the  filtered  power  entry
       module (where ON/OFF switch is located) to the power supply AC input
       terminator block TB1.   Note the  location and  color  of each  wire
       BEFORE disconnecting them.

    o  Disconnect the cable to the DC fan.

    o  Remove the main power harness (molex type connector)  from the power
       supply  unit  DC  terminator  block  TB2  and   the  PXL motherboard
       (location  P1).   Note the  color of  end wires  on the  molex  type
       connectors on both TB2 and P1 BEFORE disconnecting them.

    o  Remove the 6 screws holding the power supply tray to the chassis.

    o  Install the 4 spacers to the  BOTTOM of the power supply tray.  Once
       the power  supply tray  is re-installed  these  will be pointing  to
       the bottom of PXL chassis.

    o  Install the Power Backup PCB to the spacers  with the capacitor bank
       facing the BOTTOM  of the power  supply tray.  Insure that the Power
       Backup PCB connector  edge is  on the  same end  as the power supply
       cable harness.

    o  Connect the lead from the  main  power harness  to the  Power Backup
       Module PCB.

    o  Install   the  power  supply   tray  by  replacing   the  six screws
       removed earlier.

    o  Re-connect the cable to the DC fan.

    o  Re-connect  the  3  cables   connecting   to  filtered  power  entry
       module  (where ON/OFF  switch is located) to the AC terminator block
       TB1 on the power supply.  Connect the 3 leads in  the same  order as
       was noted previously when they were disconnected.    The orientation
       of  the   cable should look as follows (from TOP down as viewed from
       the front console end):

                             +--------------+
                            |                |
	BROWN wire  <====== |== ||      || = | =======>   BLUE wire
                            |       || ===== | =====>  GREEN wire
                            |                |
                             +--------------+


    o  Re-connect the main power  harness  from  the DC terminator block TB2
       on  the power  supply  unit  to  the PXL motherboard  (location  P1).
       The molex type connectors must be replaced with the wire-color scheme
       identical to that noted previously when they were disconnected.   The
       orientation  of  the  cables to the power supply and mother board are
       as follows (TOP down as viewed from the front console end):

                              POWER SUPPLY  TB2
                            +-------------------+ pin 1

	    RED   wire <----  =================  ---->  YELLOW wire
			        CABLE  HARNESS
                                (TWISTED ONCE) 
	    GREEN wire <----  =================  ---->  RED wire

                            +-------------------+
 			      PXL   MOTHERBOARD
			         LOCATION P1

       The main power harness cable has a friction key  lock  at  the molex
       connector  ends and requires a  single twist to insure  that the key
       (or L shaped) end is inserted correctly at both ends.

       NOTE:  Initial production units contain a 15-pin molex connector for
              connecting to the AC terminator block TB2 on the power supply
	      unit.  The TB2  terminator  block is a  7 output points  with
	      each point being  a 2-pin connection, for a total of 14-pins.
	      It is important to insure that  the 15th pin is not connected
	      to  any  point on the power supply  terminator block  as this
	      will  insure proper  connection.   If  installed  with  pin-1
	      shifted off the block,  there will be  an open  condition and
	      a clicking type noise  will be heard.  Simply shift the molex
	      connector over one pin after powering off the unit.

    o  Re-connect the AC power  cord and  power  PXL on.   The Power Backup
       capacitor bank will be  completely charged  by the  time any code is
       loaded into the PXL.

    o  Load any code (standalone diagnostic or ISIS code) into the PXL  and
       verify the Power Backup module is operational.


4.  Power check out:

    o  The POWER ONE power supply automatically adjusts to the  power input
       and no jumpers or fuse changes are required.

    o  Connect the AC power cord to the receptacle on the back panel.

    o  Power the unit ON.

    o  Verify the DC fan is operational.
    
    o  Verify  the voltages on the  PSU.  The  test  points  and adjustment
       pots on the PXL PSU are as follows:

	     | TB1-3             P S U                       TB2-3 |
	     |                                               TB2-4 |
	     |                                           V2  TB2-5 |
	     |                                               TB2-6 |
	     |                                           V1  TB2-7 |
	     |                                                     |
	     +-----------------------------------------------------+

	     ** NOTE:   Measure the voltage on TB2 at the screw lugs
	                and NOT from the molex connector.

             where

	       TB1-1 =  GROUND
	       TB1-2 =  N
	       TB1-3 =  L
	       
               TB2-1 =  -12 volt
               TB2-2 =   -5 volt
               TB2-3 =  +12 volt
               TB2-4 =  GROUND
               TB2-5 =  GROUND
               TB2-6 =   +5 volt
               TB2-7 =   +5 volt

               V1    =   +5 VDC adjustment pot
               V2    =  +12 VDC adjustment pot

    o  Using  a DVM,  measure the +5 volt level across TB2-7 and TB2-4.  The
       voltage should  be set to 5.00 (+/- 0.2 V).    If the voltage is off,
       adjust it via the pot designated as V1 in the above diagram.

    o  Measure  the  +12 volt level across  TB2-3  and  TB2-4.   The voltage
       should  be set to 12.00 (+/- 0.2 V).    If the voltage is off, adjust
       it via the pot designated as V2 in the above diagram.


5.  Diagnostic check out:

If  a PC is available with the MAC V diagnostic NIB files and TERMITE on it,
use  the  PC to load  the  diagnostics  via the TTY port.   The file  naming 
convention  for the  PC diagnostic files  is at  the  discretion of the file
creator  and may be  named something  like .NIB or .TTY.  It is important to
note that the PXL requires the use of the MAC V diagnostics and will NOT run
with the non-MAC V diagnostics.

Set  the  TTY  port on  the  SCV24 card  (see above) to  9600 baud  and  the
Console TTY cable (part  number 160608-TAB).  If no PC is available, connect
the  network line  to the  appropriate  communication protocol  daughtercard
(insuring  that  the  SIO address  and  clocking strategy are set correctly)
and have NETCON  or NSSC  load the standalone diagnostics for the MAC V from
the SUN server.

See  the files TERMIT.DOC and PROLIT.DOC in the username NTS on the PDP's or
the PUBLIC network SUN systems for reference in doing the TTY loads.

The  following diagnostics can be found in the BETADIAG directory on the SUN
systems and should be executed in the following order:

    o  DCPU.NIB version 4.60  -  25 passes
    o  DMAC.NIB version 7.60  -  25 passes
    o  DMEM.NIB version 4.60  -  24 hours of ALL tests except 10 and 11.
    o  DSIO.NIB version 4.60  -  25 passes
    o  DSYA.NIB version 6.00  -  Minimum of 1 hour
    o  DSYN.NIB version 4.00  -  Minimum of 1 hour

NOTE:  The above  diagnostics  will  work with MAC V and non-MAC V  hardware
       and should be used for all hardware diagnostic testing.

All  diagnostics  should  pass with NO errors.  It is important to note that
the  DMEM diagnostic  requires that  ALL tests except 10 (BBU) and 11 (Scope
Loop) be executed, not just the default tests.


6.  Network Installation.

Power the PXL off.

Using  the target code  TYMFILE or project report, configure the address and
clocking  strategies for  all I/O boards.   If there  is  no  TYMFILE or the
project report is  unclear, do NOT proceed until the responsible CS provides
this information.

Connect the necessary network and application slot cables to the appropriate
I/O cards.

Power  the  PXL back on.   Ensure that the PXL is running boot by looking at
the front console.  The right  most digit  should  display  a "C", while the
left most two digits should be scrolling between 00 and FF.

Have NETCON or NSSC load the appropriate code in the PXL.

From the Console TTY port, log into DDT in slot FF (ISIS kernel) and  verify
the node is operational  by  entering the  following DDT commands to look at
the state of the node:	

    [ Note:  Terminate EACH command with a carriage return ]

    o  ?DIAG
    o  ?HIST

The  ?DIAG  and  ?HIST commands will display any  activity relating to  ISIS
that may have occurred on the node since it was loaded.  

Now move to the  node code  and check the crypto log for any problem  areas.
This is done by the following DDT and XRAY commands:

    o  ^0
    o  ?STAT

    o  ND
    o  NS
    o  CL
    o  HS

The  ND, NS, CL, and HS commands are XRAY commands to print the crypto  log,
the  node state  and host status  of all  hosts on  the node.   Look for any
abnormal message reports  in  the crypto  log such  as HDLC checksum errors,
bad BORI's,  line outages,  etc.  The  ND  display will  show  if  the nodes
link(s)  have come up and if any crashes have occurred.  The HS command will
display  the state  of  all hosts  on the  node and these  states should  be
verified by  the NSSC or NETCON.


7.  Exit from  the console port by typing a  CONTROL-C in XRAY.

8.  Remove the console cable.

9.  Replace the cover.  DO NOT stack PXL engines.

10.  Leave TYMFILE copy with PXL engine.


5.2  TROUBLESHOOTING.



1.  FAILS TO BOOT.

NOTE:  For each failure it is necessary to  UNLOCK the  front console keypad
       before any keypad action  is allowed.  The unlocking can be performed
       by entering the three-key sequence: [BLANK] [E] [1].


Check  that the WAIT LED is not illuminated and the front console display is
not halted.  Depress the boot switch on the back of the SCV24 card to verify
whether  the boot  function is  operational  or  not.  If the PXL boots, the
watchdog timer is probably not configured correctly.  If the boot fails, the
SCV24 may not have the  multifunction logic enabled, see section 4.1.3 above
for SW2, dip switch 3.  

If  the console display hangs with the "0FF000 BA5E" display verify that the
BRG  interrupter switch  on the  SCV24 card is enabled.  The BRG interrupter
is located on switch bank SW2, switch 1 and should be CLOSED or OFF.

Verify  that the  watchdog timer  is enabled  on the SCV24 card.   There are
two parts to the watchdog timer on the SCV24 card:

    o  Switch bank SW2, dip switch 4.
    o  Jumper E1.

The watchdog timer  switch on switch bank SW2 is switch 4 and must be in the
OPEN or OFF position.   If this switch is enabled (CLOSED or ON) and the INI
button on the front console is entered, the PXL will go into BOOT.

The  watchdog timer  jumper  at location E1 is the real determinator for the
watchdog timer function.   If the watchdog timer is is to be  ENABLED then a
jumper should be installed at E1.


2.  CONTINUOUS RE-BOOT.

Generally  this will most  likely occur if the boot is having  trouble being
relocated into memory.   This would indicate a MAC or Memory  problem,  both
of  which  reside  on  the  PXL  Motherboard  and are NOT field replaceable.
Before declaring  the unit  dead,  power  the  PXL off,  remove  all  option
cards, remove  and reseat the PXL SIO motherboard and SCV24 card and attempt
to boot the unit.


3.  FAILS TO DOWNLINE LOAD.

Verify  the port addressing  and  clocking scheme  desired  for  the network
connection line.  Power off the unit and reseat the PXL SIO motherboard.

4.  LOADS FINE, BUT HALTS AT ADDRESS 70 ON START-UP.

If the right most digits of the front console display is 70 and the wait bar
LED  is illuminated following the load,  the ISIS code has halted.  Hit  the 
PSW button to display the actual ISIS crash code.  Some of the most frequent
ISIS crash codes are as follows:

    BADxx 8720  -  Indicates a parity error during  initialization.  This
                   generally is a hard failure as the code can NOT create
		   a parity error.  Before declaring  the PXL DOA,  clear
		   the memory via the front console and attempt a reload.
		   If the reload also fails the  parity error is real and
		   should have been caught by the MEMORY diagnostic.
    
    BAD00 8730  -  Indicates an unexpected I/O  interrupt occurred.  This
                   is  generally  attributed to  clocks  on a  SYNC  port
		   that is not assigned (not defined in the TYMFILE).

    BAD00 8763  -  Indicates  ISIS was  unable to  connect  a slot during
                   startup.  Check that  the assembly  was clean,  no gen
		   errors.  Additionally  check that the hardware (SCV24)
		   and software  (ISIS) match on the BAUDR setting.  This
		   may also be a  result of  a  BITS load with  ALL slots
		   simultaneously,  or  with a slot that is NOT assembled
		   for MAC V.

    BAD04 8753  -  Indicates a memory range error.   Most common cause of
                   this is a software  configuration error in an assembly
		   attempting to load more than 1Mb of memory.

    BAD04 8770  -  Indicates an  ISIS memory inconsistency.   Check  that
                   the assembly totals out to be less than 1Mb of memory.

    BAD04 8775  -  Indicates an  ISIS memory inconsistency.   Check  that
                   the assembly totals out to be less than 1Mb of memory.

For further ISIS and node code crash information see Section 10.

5.  LOADS FINE, BUT LINE WILL NOT COME UP.

Verify that  the port addressing scheme on the hardware matches the software
intentions.  Additionally, use the Console TTY port to verify that  there is
a TII link defined or and XLINK available in the node code on the PXL  (also
have NETCON or NSSC verify availability of this on the neighbor).

6.  NO RESPONSE ON CONSOLE PORT AFTER CODE LOADED.

Verify  that the terminal and  the console port speed set on SCV24  card are
set the same (see section 4.1.3 above).  Verify  that the connection between
the Console port and the terminal is the  160608-TAB cable with NO crossover
cable in between.

7.  INI ON FRONT CONSOLE CAUSES PXL TO GO INTO BOOT.

This  problem is  most  likely  caused  because switch bank SW2 on the SCV24
card has the watchdog timer  switch (S4) ENABLED or ON.  This switch MUST be
turned  OFF or DISABLED  or an INI from the front console will cause the PXL
to enter BOOT.

8.  BITS LOAD FAILS WITH A SEGMENT SIZE ERROR.

This  error usually  indicates  that  the wrong version of BITS was envoked.
Make sure the BITS you are using is version 5.01 C/N 46 or greater.  

9.  BITS LOAD FAILS WITH NO SPACE AVAILABLE ERROR.

This  error usually  indicates that  the DMAMAP macro has an incorrect value
defined for a slot.   If NO  DMA is  allocated to the  slot insure  that the
DMAMAP macro is not  included in  the slot definition.   If DMA is allocated
to the slot, check  the interface  code gen  to insure the value assigned in
the DMAMAP  macro  is  equal to  the specified  amount  and  the  TOTAL core
allocation is adequate (DMAMAP plus CONVENTIONAL memory).

10.  BITS LOAD FAILS WITH AN ISIS BAD00 8763 CRASH.

This error  is a  result of  some corruption  of the code during  either the 
loading process or ISIS initialization.  The BAD00 8763 indicates  that ISIS
was unable   to  connect  slot 0  at initialization  and therefore  crashed.  
Verify  the code  generation and  configuration  was accurate and reload the
PXL with ONLY the ISIS  kernel  and Node Code (slots FF and 00).  Also check
that the baud  rate  generator (BAUDR in ISIS tymfile and N/T  jumper on the
SCV24) match.

11.  V35 PORTS WILL NOT TALK OR EXPERIENCE HDLC CRC/ABORT ERRORS.

The  most common  cause of this error is that the SV35 ports are not set for
either EXTERNAL or  INTERAL clocking  properly.  The  clocking  involves not
only clock  enable/disable switches  (S2 and S3 for  port 0 or S1 and S4 for
port 1) but  also the internal/external  clock jumpers (E1 and E2 for port 0
or  E4 and E5  for  port  1).   Double  check  the  internal/external  clock
direction switches for the appropriate port(s).

Verify  the strapping  of the SV35 card based on the REV level of the board,
either REV B (see section 4.2.2.B) or REV D (see section 4.2.2.D).

9.4  LOADING VIA BITS.

Loading  of the PXL and all MAC V hardware requires BITS for loading.  There
is no mechanism in  ELF for MAC V addressing, nor is there any plan for this
option to be incorporated into ELF.

For engine dumps or loads  the second BITS prompt (for hardware type) is NOT
required and a simple carriage return is adequate.

9.4.1  FULL ENGINE LOAD.

The following is a sample of a downline load via BITS:

10.  CRASH CODES

The  following section  lists the current ISIS crash codes and selected Node
Code crash codes.  For further details on the numerous Node Code crash codes
and specifications, see the XRAY users guide.

In  addition  section 10.3 shows  the method  of looking  at the ISIS kernel
or application slot crash table areas with the MAC V addressing.

10.1  ISIS CRASH CODES.

The following sections will  outline  the  main  ISIS  crashes codes, give a
description  of the  crash  code  and  a possible cause.  The format of each
section detailing the crash code is in the following format:

  CONSOLE DISPLAY   SYMPTOM and POSSIBLE CAUSE

    BADxx 87xx       Description [possible cause]


The  possible cause (enclosed in brackets [..]) is not hard and fast, but is
included  as a guide for potential hardware related items.  These causes are
not specific to the  PXL architecture  but in  general apply  to  the engine
hardware architecture.

Not all of the following crash codes  will apply  to the PXL, but are listed
for reference.


The  first section  will outline the main hard failures where an engine will
not even boot and is in the following format:

  CONSOLE DISPLAY   SYMPTOM and POSSIBLE CAUSE

    xxxxx DEAD      Description [possible cause]

    0001A DEAD      Illegal second decode of an instruction

    00020 DEAD      Unused interrupt (0) became active

    00060 DEAD      Power-down interrupt

    00100 DEAD      No response to device address during boot

    00160 DEAD      ATN00 interrupt (only without enhanced async or sync)

    001A0 DEAD      ATN10 interrupt (only without enhanced sync)

    001A8 DEAD      Sync signal active when it should be inactive

    001E9 DEAD      No sync response to RACK20 for ATN20

    002xx DEAD      Bad device status during boot (xx = status)

    00608 DEAD      No sync  response  to  RACK10  for  ATN10  (only  with
                    enhanced sync)

    00610 DEAD      Level 1 device number out of range (only with enhanced
                    sync)

    0DEAD 0BAD      Console operator error



The following section will describe the most common ISIS crashes and will be
in the following format:

10.2  NODE CODE CRASH CODES.

The  following is a VERY limited selection of common node code crashes.  For
details on  these and  other node  code  crashes  refer  to  the XRAY User's
Guide for details.

The following list is the generic classifications of node code crashes:

   CRASH CODE      SYMPTOM

   [HARDWARE crash codes]

      0000         Manual restart
      0001         Power fail
      0002         Parity error
      0003         Dispatcher crash
      0004         Illegal instruction
      0005         Illegal SVC
      0006         System crash (parity error)
      0007         Protection violation
      0008         Non-recoverable device check


   [SOFTWARE crash codes]

      xx42         Software detected instruction malfunction

      xx62         Software detected hardware consistency error

      xx63         Software consistency error

                   0E63  =  After  attempting  to  chain  a  new   output
		            command  on an  SIO line,  an invalid  status
			    code  (not  1 or 2)  was  reported.   This is
			    probably an SIO hardware problem.

                   1463  =  RMAKE was  tring  to  make a  logical  record
		            which would have only one byte of data in it,
			    but the byte of data was a "00", "01" or "02"
			    none  of  which can  travel  by  itself  in a
			    logical record.   The byte is presumably  the
			    first or second  byte  of  a  character  pair
			    which go separated from its mate.
		            

                   2E63  =  RMAKE, while  copying  a  logical record into
		            history buffer, found  an  isolated "02" byte
			    in the data.

                   3E63  =  DISPI, while moving data into the dispatcher,
		            detected data on a channel that had  no entry
			    in the dispatcher permuter table.

                   4A63  =  Illegal call to WCI for buffer = 0 or 1.

                   5063  =  Illegal call to GCI for buffer = 0 or 1.

		   5463  =  Illegal call to CBCLR for buffer not assigned
		            to a channel.

                   5663  =  The BCT of a history buffer went  negative as
		            a result of history buffer pruning.

		   6863  =  ZAPV  while  zapping second half of a circuit
		            detects  that the  complimentary buffer  flag
			    was  not zero (first  half of the circuit had
			    not been zapped). 

                   7263  =  FNDKNC  while  attempting  to  locate a  free
		            channel for a link detects a  channel with  a
			    zero entry in the  permuter table (IOTAB) but
			    no bit set  in  the  active port array (a bit
			    set means the port is available).

                   9263  =  The count of bufferlet bytes  in use has gone
		            less than 0 during it's update.

                   9463  =  The count of history  bufferlet bytes  in use
		            has gone less than 0 during it's update.

      xx64         Empty buffer or illegal buffer index GCI crash

                   0264  =  GCI was  called  to  get a  character from  a
		            buffer however  the buffer was empty or a bad
			    buffer index was used (not a multiple of 4)

      xx66         Illegal bufferlet free list pointer

      xx67         SVC errors

                   6067  =  ISIS connect SYNC SVC error.
		   6467  =  ISIS force SYNC output SVC error.

		   7267  =  ISIS connect SIO SVC error.
		   7467  =  ISIS start SIO input SVC error.
		   7667  =  ISIS start SIO output SVC error.

10.3  CRASH INFORMATION GATHERING.

Due  to the  addressing change  required  for  MAC V  hardware  some of  the
methods  for gathering  on-line crash  information has changed.  In addition
appending  the symbol  tables to  the nib  files  requires  that the "-v" be 
included in the command line for invoking NAD.

In the SIO status display there MAY be two sets of SIO interrupt codes:

   o  LAST non-zero status and line number

   o  CURRENT status and line number



These BOTH follow the same decoding scheme:

       6C87  0100  000D  6200  2200  0000  0000  0100

			 ||     --------  Current interrupt code
			 ||
			 | -------------  Last non-zero return
			 |                line number
			 |
			  --------------  Last non-zero return
			                  interrupt code
   


For  quick reference  to the  SIO  status  areas, the  following application
slot LABELs need to be located in the individual slot code:

   o  NODE CODE  -  Use the XRAY SS (SIO Status) command.

   o  XCOM       -  Label SIOTn for 0E0x bytes, where n is the logical
                    unit number (line number within the slot).

   o  SDLC       -  Label SIOTn for 0E0x bytes, where n is the logical
                    unit number (line number within the slot).

   o  CONSAT     -  Label STASIO for 40x bytes, using the label OCMSOF
                    for offsets  to each  logical unit (generally  the
		    offsets are 40x bytes).

   o  TYMCOM     -  Label SIOSTA for 40x bytes, using the label OCMSOF
                    for offsets  to each  logical unit (generally  the
		    offsets are 40x bytes).


12.  TTY LOADABLE FILES

The  following  section will  outline  those  steps  necessary  to create PC
based files which can be used for TTY loading.

The  regular diagnostics plus the MAC5 compatible diagnostics can be  pulled
down to a PC from  the UNIX system,  but  it  is a  little more  complicated
than using TERMITE and the PDP's.

The  mechanism for  pulling the  files down  to the PC depends upon the comm
package  on the PC.  It is not done  with TERMITE and NAD, as the %8 feature
in NAD on UNIX has been disabled.

There  are two  basic  parts  to  creating the PC based files:  creating TTY
loadable files under UNIX; and downloading the files to a PC.

On  the PC,  log into  the  UNIX server and copy  the  diagnostic  nib  file
to your personal directory (diags can be found on ~engdiag).   Do not log in
with  any  flow  control set.   Make  sure that  the parity and  bit setting
match from  the PC   to the modem  (ie, 7E1).   Insure that  flow control is
disabled on the modem also.

The first part  (creating UNIX based TTY loadable files) involves using BITS
to create the TTY file, a sample of which is shown below:


	bruces% bits
        BITS-5.00 (C/N 44) (SunOS 4.x) (Hardware: SUN3)
        Thu Sep 12 14:58:16 1991


        bits command: hl
        Engine merge or standalone. [(?),s,e,k,i=return] : s
           No merge. Enter standalone file name : dcpu.nib
        Check the tty filename? [n, y=return] : n
        Enter filename : dcpu.tty
         dcpu.tty is not a tty port.
         Writing to file dcpu.tty. 
        Loading dcpu.nib as ISIS kernel 
        ...Segment 0:   Addresses 0-ffff (phys 0-ffff)
        ...Segment 1:   Addresses 10000-12fd7 (phys 10000-12fd7)

        bits command: q


The next step is to fire up  the UNIX  based protocol transfer  program that
matches the one your PC comm package will use (such as XMODEM, ZMODEM).  For
XMODEM the UNIX program is  "sx", for ZMODEM it is "sz".  The format for the
command is "sx <filename>".  This will print an information message  of some
sort  to the terminal.  The following steps utilize the  XMODEM package  and
PCPLUS comm  package, but   the  format  is  generally the same for any comm
package..  These steps are:

  o  On the UNIX  system  enable  the  transfer protocol and set the
     terminal to echo carriage returns:

       bruces%echo <cntl>]          (CONTROL and "[" key)

       bruces%sx <file>

  o  Fire up the PC comm package.

       o  PAGE-DOWN key to get to the download protocol menu

       o  At the protocol selection menu  enter the option for XMODEM

       o  At the filename prompt  enter  filename on the PC the file
          is to be received as.

       o  The  PC download begins and will display a message when it
          completes.


Once  the files  are downloaded  to the PC, the TTY files can be loaded into
the  PXL (or any other hardware)  using  TERMITE or a comm package using RAW
ASCII  data transfer (such  as  PCPLUS in  ASCII upload protocol mode).  For
additional information on the TERMITE see the following files:

    TERMIT.DOC  -  TERMITE Users Guide
    PROLIT.DOC  -  File loading procedures with TERMITE
