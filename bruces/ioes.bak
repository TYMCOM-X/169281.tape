----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cindy,

Yesterday Terry Maccarone  entered an  order for a replacement PXL sync card
for NTS (Order 65611).  The purpose of this Ontyme is stress the criticality
of securing the SP card (470360-001) this week as that board is scheduled to
be hand carried  to Hong Kong  (along with  the rest  of the PXL) the second
week in May.  In the time between now and the scheduled  delivery I need the
board to QA some software being released specifically for Hongkong Shanghai
Bank on the PXL.

Any assistance you can provide in pushing the SP card through  Manufacturing
would be greatly appreciated.  The need for this rush order  is the original
SP  card received  from Manufacturing  was DOA,  but there  apparently is no
mechanism in place for Manufacturing to repair defective boards.

Thank you for your help.

Bruce
