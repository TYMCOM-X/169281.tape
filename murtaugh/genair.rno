INTRODUCTION
.skip 2
.left margin 18
This manual is provided to give a Network specialist a check list approach
to network operations and trouble-shooting.  Many of the steps are designed
around 'ODDS'.  We have started off the diagnostic processes testing the
easiest component first in an area that fails more often.  These guidelines
are not meant to replace common sense trouble-shooting or technical
knowledge.  Knowledge of each network diagnostic is a criteria in itself.
.skip 2
.left margin 18
These guidelines are meant to follow two philosophies:

I.  PURPOSE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
This procedure defines the process by which TMCS, XRAY and PROBE are used
by Network Specialists.  A detailed description of TMCS, XRAY and PROBE and
their uses is documented in their appropriate manuals located on
Tymnet's System (NETDVDOC:33).

II.  DEFINITION
.SKIP 1
.left margin 18
.indent -7
NOTE:  This procedure contains specific user names.  These names are included
as examples only.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  PROBE:  PROBE is a utility package that resides on all Network
Supervisors.  It allows you to query all of the Network nodes, lines
and host interfaces and control some supervisor functions.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  TMCS:  The Tymnet monitoring and control system (Product Title) is an inter-active
system which provides multiple users with selective access to the status
of the Tymnet Technology Network.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  XRAY:  XRAY is an interactive monitoring and debugging system that
provides a real-time window into a Tymnet II node.  Through it, the
user can conveniently display information about the node's configuration,
performance and history.  Remember, this is only the local node.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  PROBE:  Network Control should have one terminal logged into job
slot of each supervisor at all times. One (1) should be logged into the
active Supervisor and the others should be logged into our standby
supervisors.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
.TEST PAGE 5
A.  The username "NETCON" will only be used by the pilot of the
Network.  All other PROBE terminals will be logged in using the
username of the specialist.  Remember, there should never be two (2)
"NETCONS" logged into PROBE at the same time.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
B.  The standby terminals after being logged into PROBE,
and the printer turned on, should have a   
"LOG S" command issued.  This command serves two purposes:
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
1.  It starts a logger by seconds on the active Supervisor.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
2.  It will give you the last time the inactive Supervisor went to
sleep and also, if the Sup had taken a crash, the time the crash occurred.
The inactive Supervisor paper log is also set to run in this mode, should
one of the inactive Supervisors start a Takeover.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
C.  The tasks that are most often performed by Network Control using
PROBE:
.skip 1
.left margin 22

3.  XRAY:  XRAY provides a real-time window into a Tymnet II node.  
Through it, the user can conveniently display information about the node's
configuration, performance and history.  XRAY also has commands to monitor 
the status of a node's links, trace activity and isolate problems in
the node.  Last (and perhaps least) XRAY is a debugging tool for
programmers who can use it to diagnose nodecode and network bugs.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.INDENT -4
A.  Network control uses what is known as "REMOTE XRAY".  Remote access is
gained by remotely logging into the kernel host of a node that is up in the
network.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
B.  "ND" - Node Descriptor.  This is the primary command used within
Network Control. This command lets the controller find out more, in
less time, about a node configuration and current status in the node than
he could through any number of PROBE, TMCS and DDT (De-bugger) commands.

III. PROCEDURES
.skip 1
.left margin 14
I.  To determine fundamental condition of the node:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Log into XRAY in the target node.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  In response to the XRAY prompt type: ND
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  Observe the XRAY output and note the following:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
a.  Elapsed time since "NODE FIRST CAME UP"
.SKIP 1
.LEFT MARGIN 23
.indent -1
(This is time since node was last loaded with code.)
.skip 1
.left margin 22
b.  Elapsed time since "NODE LAST CAME UP"
.skip 1
.left margin 23
.indent -1
(This is time since node last recovered from a crash.)
.skip 1
.left margin 22
c.  The crash COUNT, TYPE and ADDRESS.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
d.  The STATUS of the lines.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
e.  The ERRATE of the lines.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
f.  The TIILNK NEIGHBORS DOWN list.  These are neighbors which were
specified for this node in its TYM file but which have not communicated
with the target node since it was last loaded with code.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
4.  At the XRAY prompt type: CL xx .
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
a.  THE QUALITY XX WILL BE THE NUMBER OF THE MOST RECENT CRYPTO LOGGER
messages you wish to view.  (XRAY expects xx to be entered in HEX.
A maximum of 256 (DECIMAL), ie. FF (HEX), messages can be displayed.)
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
b.  Observe the XRAY crypto logger output for indications of kernel
overloads, line anomalies, slot reports, etc.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
5.  Again at the XRAY prompt type: NS
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
a.  Observe the EXCT (Executive Loop Count) value.  It should be greater
than 40 on a properly loaded node.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
b.  Observe the EXLW value.  (This is lowest Executive Loop Count which
the node has experienced since the values were last reset.)
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
c.  Observe the EXWH value.  (This is the greatest Executive Loop Count
which the machine has experienced since the values were last reset.)
.skip 1
.left margin 33
.indent -7
NOTE:  The EXCT, EXLW and EXWH counts can be reset by typing: NS Z IN 
       response to the XRAY prompt.  This will allow the user to observe
       Executive Loop Count behavior during specific time frames
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
d.  Observe the TOTAL value for CODE DELAY and H-WARE DELAY.  The value
should be less than 50.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
6.  At the XRAY prompt type: KS xxxx (where xxxx = the node number of a 
neighbor).
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
a.  Observe the PACKET OVERHEAD values but remember that overhead is 
inversely proportional to data traffic.  The overhead remains roughly
fixed and if there is little data on the line, the percentage of 
overhead will be driven up.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
b.  Observe the BANDWIDTH utilization.  It should be less than 60% and
not greater than 70%.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
c.  Observe the TOTAL for LINK DELAY.  It should be less than 50 ms.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
d.  Observe the OVERLOAD COUNT.  This is the number of times the RMAKE
routine could not service all channels with data within 500 ms.  A
threshold of 10/min exists for this measurement.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
e.  Observe the SATURATION COUNT.  This indicated the number of times the 
link was never idle for a 1/2 second period.  A threshold of 30/min exists
for this measurement.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
f.  Observe the BACKLOG COUNT.  This is the number of times the RMAKE 
routine could not make a packet due to a closed window.
.skip 1

II.  To obtain CRASH TABLE information from a running ISIS node:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Using LOADII or ELF load SLCRSH.NIB into an unused slot in the target
node.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  Log into DDT in the target node.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  Enter the slot just loaded with SLCRSH.NIB.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  Run SLCRSH by typing ?STAT at the DDT prompt.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
5.  SLCRSH will return information relative to the node, the node type,
version of code, crash count and the time the node was last taken over by
the supervisor.  It will also display the SUMMARY CRASH TABLE, the DETAIL
CRASH TABLES, REGISTER SET 0 and F contents, MAC Status and Segmentation
Register contents.
.SKIP 2

III. PROCEDURES
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
I.   To determine if the target slot is RUNNING:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
1.  Log into DDT in the target node.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
2.  Enter the target slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 27
.indent -1
(If the slot is halted, you should receive a "SLOT HALTED" message.
However, further verification of slot operation according to the 
following steps is recommended.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
3.  At the DDT prompt type: ?CPU
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  Observe the response.  If the quantities for "RATE USER" and "RATE
SYSTEM" are greater than zero (0), the slot is running.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
5.  Further verification that the slot is running can be obtained by
typing: ?HISTORY .
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
6.  Observe the "Comments" column.  If the slot is running, the most recent
history for the target slot will indicate "STARTED" and then "RESTARTED".
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
7.  If a SYS UPTIME message is observed in the "Comments" column, it
indicates that no slot halts have occurred since a reload.
.skip 2
.left margin 18
.indent -4
II.  To determine the date and time the slot was last HALTED:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
1.  Log into DDT in the target node.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
2.  Enter the target slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
3.  In response to the DDT prompt, type: ?HISTORY .
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  Observe the "Comment" column.  "HALTED BY COMMAND" indicates that the
slot was manually halted with DDT's "H" command.  "HALTED" indicates that
the slot crashed.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
5.  Observe the right most column for the most recent indication that the 
slot was HALTED.  The left most column will indicate the time lapse since
the slot halt.  The elapsed time will be displayed in days, hours, minutes
and seconds or if the elapsed time was less than one day, the time will be
displayed in hours, minutes and seconds.
.SKIP 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
6.  The date and time of the most recent slot ste can then be 
calculated using the current date and time and the elapsed time.
.skip 2
.left margin 18
.indent -4
III. To recover a slot's CRASH TABLE:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Run the program CRASH.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  If you have to pass through a gateway to reach the target node, type
a "G" in response to the "ENTER KERNEL HOST NUMBER" prompt.
.SKIP 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  Respond to the remaining CRASH program prompts and CRASH will print
out the slot's host info, the versions of code in the ISIS kernel and the
slot, identification of the slot type, information on the last crash and
finally the slot's crash table.
.skip 1
.left margin 28
.indent -6
NOTE: The CRASH program is an automated means of observing a slot's Crash
Table information.

3.  At the first prompt, type "GATEWAY".  This command must be used by those
without a TYMCOM-X system running on their network, before any 'CREATE'
command is used.  This tells ELF that it must login through a gateway
before it can actually login to the TYMCOM-X to retrieve data.
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  Next prompt is 'GATEWAY USERNAME HOST'.  Type in the valid username in
the user's network.
.left margin 22

.left margin 23
.indent -1
(Type 'NO' if file will always be loaded through the ELF.)
.left margin 22
.indent -4
5.  The user is prompted for the TYMCOM-X login string as follows:
'TYMCOM-X USERNAME,HOST': The user enters the username to be used to log
into the TYMCOM-X in TYMNET where the load data is stored - enter host
number if required.
.left margin 22
.indent -4
6.  User is then prompted 'PASSWORD': Enter password for username just
entered.  Password will not be echoed to the terminal.

* If a user's connect time to PROBE is to be checked, turn bit 4 of the
low order off.  This will automatically log the user off after an assembled
in time frame.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
There are two groups of user names in PROBE.  The first and most important 
is the assembled in group.  This is one or more names, password and status
which is compiled into the PROBE software at system generation time.  YOU
MUST HAVE ONE ASSEMBLED IN PROBE NAME.  The second group is Disk resident
names, passwords and status level.  To bring a supervisor up from scratch,
you need the assembled in name to enter at least your first Disk resident
name.  Any Disk resident name of 35 or 37 may enter probe names on disk.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Having access to an assembled in user name for day to day operation is 
important.  This is to the possibility of a disk failure barring any Disk
resident name from logging in.  If this occurs, the only control of 
supervisor will be through the power off switch.  PROBE has a maximum limit
on simultaneous users.  One slot is always held in reserve for an assembled
in user, thus guaranteeing access to your Network Control personnel.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III. PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  Use the `list' command to determine a free disk slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  Type "ENTER [Job slot] [user name] [STATUS level]"
The slot number should be used in each supervisor.
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -9
Example: ENTER 127 NETWORK1 37 - will give access to the user name 
NETWORK1 with a status of 37.  The password will be a defaulted value.
See your network administrator for the password.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  To delete a user name, use the list command to find the slot number.
Type "ENTER [slot number]"
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -9
Example: ENTER 127 - This will delete the name created in step 2 above.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  The list command will list all probe names.  All assembled in names
will be preceded by "AAA".  All Disk names will be preceded by a number 
0 through your system generation maximum.  Any name having an asteric
by the slot number has a default password.  The owner or user of that
PROBE name should be reminded to change it or have the name removed.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  For assembled in names, the `PSWD' should be used to find a hex
cipher for a user name and password.
These two values should be given to the system programmer to generate into
PROBE.  This is the only method of adding, deleting or changing the default
password of this name.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  Any PROBE user name may change the password using the `Password' command.

RECONFIGURING THE TYMNET MONITOR AND CONTROL SYSTEM
.break
.skip 3
.left margin 10
I.   PURPOSE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
To define the steps necessary for the Reconfiguration of NEM to provide for
recovery from disk errors.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  SCOPE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
This procedure has been quite carefully worked out over time.  If followed, it will
insure recovery in the event of a disk error.  
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III. PROCEDURE
.left margin 15
.indent -1
(In the following file names, "_#_#_#_#" is the number of the node in which
the relevant NEM is resident.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  Rename the ND_#_#_#_#.NI1 to BK_#_#_#_#.NI1. (Do not ever write over code.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  Rename the ND_#_#_#_#.N01 to BK_#_#_#_#.N01. (This never works the first time.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  Rename the ND_#_#_#_#.BND to BK_#_#_#_#.BND. (Always do this in order!)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  Rename the ND_#_#_#_#.D01 to BK_#_#_#_#.D01. (Old disk configuration)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  Rename the ND_#_#_#_#.A01 to ND_#_#_#_#.D01. (This is current configuration.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  Copy   the ND_#_#_#_#.D01 to ND_#_#_#_#.A01. (After the copy, make changes
to the new A01 file.  Leave the D01 alone.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
7.  Log into the TMCS host and type the command [ARCH STORE 0].  This will
take a copy of all the node names and host name and user profiles and all
kinds of related material that makes TMCS work.  If there is a I/O error,
call the site and ask them to check the tape drive.  If the drive is online
have them initializing the node or hault and execute the slot.  The code sometimes hangs
up the tape drive.  By initializing the node, the host sees the tape drive
again.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
A.  Before you make changes to the new A01 file, you must run TMRE.  This
program will make a memory estimate for the slot.  The procedure is 
"R(SOURCE)TMRE".  The program will prompt the user for configuration.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
B.  Create a NI1 file by running the ND_#_#_#_#.CI1 file.  This will take about
15 minutes at non-peak time or 1.5 hours at peak time.  Each interface takes 
about 26000 TRU'S so you will need a username with a unlimited budget.  Also
the directory will need at least 10,000 pages.  After each gen, delete
*.TMP files.  The Pascal compiler creates a lot of TMP files.
.SKIP 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
C.  After generating the NI1 file (known as 'TMDM'), the file needs to be
loaded into the slot.  There are 2 procedures, first is for a 1 MEG
machine.  The second is a procedure for a multi MEG machine.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
1.  R LOADII;SLOT,KHOST,1,ND_#_#_#_#.NI1
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
2.  R COM;ND_#_#_#_#.LI1 (This is a command file for the code to be loaded into
the second MEG through DDT.  The file does all the work.)
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
D.  After the slot has been loaded with TMDM, it will return to the network.
When the slot comes up, you will need to login right away.  The slot will
only let one user in.  After that point, the host will show up no ports.  If
a TMCS user beats you to the host, you will need to log into DDT and hault
and execute the slot.  Then login to slot right after doing this process.
This problem comes from users who have PVC ports set up to build circuits
into TMCS.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
E.  When you get into the TMCS host, you will see a heading refering to 
disk maintenance program with some version number with a '*' for a
prompt.  At this point, TMCS is ready for your next command.  Your first
command is 'SEE BELOW'.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4  
1.  Type 'DISP CONFIG' (This will display the old configuration and the 
new configuration.  Warning: This only shows the configurations that you
referenced at the gen, not what is in the machine.)
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4  
2.  Type 'RECONF' (At this time TMDM is reconfiguring the 300 Megabite
disk.  On the display, if you did right, you will see the areas that are being
relocated.  If you did this wrong, you will see [CONFIG ERRORS].  This 
is only a warning.  The information is not lost.  When you see this error
it means that your D01 file is wrong.  So go back to the system you genned
it on and start over.  Keep your ckt into the TMCS host.  If you do not,
someone could log into the host and type [INIT].  The INIT command is used
to zero out the disk.  This deletes everything off the disk like node
names and host name and user profiles and all the related material that     
make TMCS work.  So if you do not have a good copy on tape, start crying.
But do not fear, you are not lost.  Get a ARCH STORE off another TMCS host
in the network.  When the ARCH STORE is done have the tape sent to wherever 
you need it.  Then have the tape put on the drive load TMDM if you need to.
Then type [ARCH RESTORE 0].  This will dump all information from tape to disk.
This will take about 10 minutes.  After a "RESTORE" command, you must halt
and restart the slot.

I.  PURPOSE
.skip 1

This document specifies the procedure to be used for moving the
Network Supervisor.  This procedure will be defined in two different
categories.  Scheduled moves and unscheduled moves.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  SCHEDULED MOVES
.skip 1
.left margin 18
A scheduled Supervisor move is when the active Network Supervisor
is put to sleep at a scheduled period of time, and access to the
Network is denied until another Network Supervisor is awakened, and
taken control of 75 percent of the Network (75 percent of the nodes
the Sup had last time active).
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  Prior to the actual move, make a copy of the ALL NODES List (AN), the
SHUT TABLE (LSHUT), the COUNT OF MACHINES (COUNT), last accounting block
collected (LACCT) and the number of accounting blocks remaining (ACCT).
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  On the active Supervisor, do TSLEEP, enter the PASSWORD, but do not
do a carriage return at this time.
.LEFT MARGIN 24
.indent -6
NOTE: The 'GSLEEP' command can be used for a Graceful sleep, in place of
'TSLEEP'.  Beware of the assembled in GSLEEP period.  This will determine
how long to wait prior to entering the TWAKE command.  The GSLEEP command
allows the sup to finish all pending logins as refuses new ones prior to
going to sleep.  This prevents hung users.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  On the sleeping Supervisor, you are moving to, do a TWAKE, enter
the Password, but do not do a carriage return.

states 0-4.  TYMNET II has state 0 only.  If you cannot correct the
problem with a retake of the upstream neighbor, notify Field
Engineering (FE) of that particular region.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  After the takeover is completed, the following must be accomplished.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
A.  Do a LSTMIN on the Supervisor you have just put to sleep.  Get total
logins.
.left margin 22
.indent -4
B.  Type version on the active Supervisor and get the version of code
running PROBE, KERNEL and SUPER.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
C.  Do an ALL NODES (AN) and LIST SHUTS (LSHUT) and COUNT.  Compare the
LSHUT from the current active Supervisor with the LSHUT from the
Supervisor you have just put to sleep.  There should be no difference
on LSHUT and COUNT.  If there is a different in the COUNT, use the AN
to determine the discrepancy.

I.   PURPOSE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The procedure outlines the means by which a recovery from a network 
supervisor failure can be effected.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  REQUIREMENTS
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Access to PROBE with full license.
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  Physical access, either direct or indirect to the failing network
supervisor.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III. DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
A network supervisor (Sup) failure is defined as any condition which prevents
a supervisor from operating a network in an acceptable and dependable manner.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
IV.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
I.  Insuring that the Network has a fully operational Active Supervisor
.skip 1
.left margin 18
In the event of a supervisor failure, the failing supervisor will either be
replaced automatically by a standby supervisor or the failing supervisor 
will have to be replaced by means of a manual supervisor move.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  If an operator detects a supervisor failure condition, he may manually
replace that supervisor in accordance with the steps outlined in the 
procedure NETWORK SUPERVISOR MOVES.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  If a Sup failure occurs and that Sup relinquishes control of the 
network to a Sup which automatically awakens:
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
a.  Make certain that only one supervisor has taken over the network by
performing the Probe STAT command on all of the supervisors on the network.
The STAT results should show only ONE (1) Sup which is neither FROZEN nor
SLEEPING.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
b.  If necessary use the Probe TWAKE and TSLEEP commands to exercise any
necessary control over the selection of the active Sup.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
c.  If Probe access to any of the remaining Sups is not available and can
not be established, then:
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -4
1.  Observe the right most digit displayed on the front panel of the 
inaccessible Sup.
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -4
2.  The condition of the Sup then can be determined by the sequence which 
that digit is displaying.  (See below)

.indent -18
Sequencing 0 - 1  The Sup is inactive and is recovering from a crash.
.skip 1
.left margin 48
.indent -18
Sequencing 0 - 2  The Sup is inactive and probably does not have an
operating Supervisor or Kernel code.
.skip 1
.left margin 48
.indent -18
Sequencing 0 - 3  The Sup is inactive, frozen and off of the run queue.
.skip 1
.left margin 48
.indent -18
Sequencing 0 - 4  This indicates that the Sup is inactive and sleeping.
.skip 1
.left margin 48
.indent -18
Sequencing 0 - 5  This indicates that the Sup is active.
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -4
3.  If a Sup can not be accessed through Probe and that Sup is active when
another Sup should be running the net, the "inaccessible" Sup can be
turned off to release it's control of the network.
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -4
4.  The desired network supervisor can then be awakened manually or, if the
desired Sup is assigned the next highest drowsiness factor, it can be
allowed to take over the network automatically.  (A manual awakening of the
desired Sup will be much less time consuming.)

1.  The procedure NODE FAILURE and RECOVERY and the procedure ISIS SLOT
FAILURES may be applicable depending upon the exact nature of the failure.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  If doubt exists about the cause of the failure or the proper means of 
restoring the Sup to a serviceable condition, support should be obtained
to assist in that process.

.left margin 18
The procedure defines the way the standby Supervisors are utilized.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The standby Supervisors have terminals located within Network Control.        
Each terminal will be logged into one of the Network Supervisors, via
PROBE.  One terminal will have an active Supervisor, the other terminals
will be logged into the other supervisors in a "ready" state.         
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  The standby Network Supervisor terminals should be the first item
checked when starting turnover.  Each should be logged into all existing 
Supervisor hosts via PROBE.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  Checking the standby terminals, you should verify that the terminal
is logged into the correct Host.  Check to see that the terminal has
a sufficient amount of paper.  Check and verify the "TIME", the (DF)
Drowiness Factor and the state of the standby supervisor.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
If a Supervisor is found to have a (DF) Drowiness factor other than
(0) zero, and/or in a state other than Active or Sleeping, it should be noted in
the Control logbook.  Check wih the offgoing shift for the
current status on these Supervisors.  Also, a Incident                  
report should be open until the problem is resolved.
.page
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  A "LOG S" command will be issued on all standby Supervisors.  This will give
a logger by seconds on the Active Supervisor.  On the other Supervisors,
the last time that particular Supervisor went to sleep,
should be displayed.  Each terminal should be set to run on
hardcopy, except the terminal for the Active Supervisor.  The purpose of the hardcopy is
to give a record of takeover, should the active Supervisor fail and a
standby Supervisor automatically starts taking over the Net.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  If there is a problem with one of the terminals used for accessing
the standby Supervisors, another terminal will be
designated as a standby terminal until the regular terminal is repaired.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  Each standby terminal should be checked at least three (3) times during
each shift.                              
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  Problem with the standby Supervisors and terminals should be reported to
the appropriate support personnel.

This procedure describes the techniques for trouble-shooting a failure
of a node and its recovery.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  REQUIREMENTS
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.nofill

1. Knowledge of TYM files.
2. Ability to use XRAY.
3. Access to loading facility, LOADII or ELF.

5. Access to PROBE.
6. Access to NAD (not essential).
.fill 
.justify
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III. PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  Verify that the node that is down is not DEADENDED (only 1 connection to
the network).  This can be done by checking the TYM file for the node that is
down (Network Configuration section).
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  If the node is deadended, check its only neighbor using a probe snap to
verify that the neighbor is up.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  If the neighbor node is down, it must first be returned to the network
before the original node can come up.  Should the neighbor be down, go back
to STEP 1 and proceed until you find a node which is up and which can be
used as a neighbor to access the down nodes.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  Check the TYM file of the neighbor to get its KERNEL HOST number.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  Log into the neighbor node with XRAY and get the LINE # that goes to
the node that is down.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  Try a CRASH DUMP using LOADII.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
7.  If a crash table address is received (valid or not), the crash dump
has been received.  The dump is complete when "EXIT" is displayed.  Go
to STEP 13.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
8.  If a crash table is not received, the crash dump must be attempted from
another neighbor and LINE # (get this info using STEP 4).
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
9.  If still no success, the node may have to be booted manually.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
10. Contact the site and request that they boot the node.  To boot a full
engine or mini-engine, have the site open the front door of the node and
on the 4th board down there is a silver toggle switch on the right side.
They must push this switch all the way up and all the way down.  To boot   
a micro-engine, have them press the "BOOT" button on the back of the
micro-engine.  An 'ATC' must be powered off.  If it is found that a engine
must be powered off to boot, the problem should be turned out for repair.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
11. If there is no one on site to boot the node, the hardware support agency 
should be contacted to check out the node.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
12. Once node is booted, repeat STEPs 5 and 6.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
13. Reload the node with the production code, using the same neighbor and
LINE # that was used in STEP 5.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
14. If the node does not return to the network, try the load again.  If
the node still does not come up, contact the support agency.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
15. Verify node is back up with PROBE snap.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
16. Verify all lines to node are back up by logging into node with XRAY.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
17. Analysis of crash dump can be performed using NAD and the ENGDMP 
command file.  If there is no access to NAD or ENGDMP, turn the crash dump
over to the support agency.

.skip 3
.left margin 10
I.   PURPOSE
.skip 1

This procedure will outline the steps that can be taken to analyze the crash
table information which is contained in engine code dumps.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  COMMENTS
.skip 1
.left margin 18
It should be remembered that the engine is a single processor system and that
during a crash, which is due to a malfunction, there is a very good chance
that the machine simply will not be capable of storing accurate and 
meaningful data concerning the details of the crash.  It is not realistic
to expect that every engine code dump will be meaningful and definitive.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III. REQUIREMENTS
.skip 1
.left margin 18
1.  Access to NAD
.left margin 18
2.  Access to the NAD Command File: ENGDMP
.skip 2
.left margin 10
IV.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  The dump of the engine code must be written to a file on a host where the
NAD software can be accessed.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  Run NAD and after the version number is printed, type ;X (xxxxx)ENGDMP
.SKIP 1

3.  The command file will execute and prompt for the file name of the node
code dump.  Respond with the appropriate dump file name and terminate the
filename with a (CTL)D as instructed by the command file.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  The command file: ENGDMP will exercise the appropriate commands in NAD and
then print out the following:

a.  General information about the node.
.left margin 30
.indent -4
b.  A crash table summary for the last 16 crashes.
.left margin 26
c.  A detailed crash table on the first crash.
.left margin 26
d.  A detailed crash table on the last crash.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
V.  INTERPRETATION
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  NEITHER crashes due to POWER FAILS nor due to MANUAL RESTARTS will be 
reported in the detailed crash tables for the first and last crash.
.skip 1

II. DEFINITION
.SKIP 1
.LEFT MARGIN 15
NETWORK NODE OUTAGE:  A network node outage  is defined as a 
node which is not accessable, nor can it be accounted for by the network
Supervisor. This may result from a hardware/software malfunction, or
a transmission facility company problem.
.skip 1
.LEFT MARGIN 10
III. PROCEDURE
.SKIP 1
.LEFT MARGIN 15
In the event of a network node failure,                      
follow the procedure below to restore service:
.skip 1
.left margin 15
.indent -4
A. Wait for ten minutes to determine if the outage will clear
itself (ie. power failure).
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1. If the outage clears, record the outage per existing documented procedures. 
.skip 1
.indent -4
2. If the problem does not clear, proceed to the next step.
.skip 1
.left margin 15
.indent -4
B. Site Evaluation: This step involves calling the site 
of the nodal location for evaluation of Telco equipment, machinery 
environment, customer equipment and nodal hardware. It will be 
necessary to call the site and locate someone that is familiar with
the node and its associated equipment.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1. Determine if the customer site has taken the node down for any reason.
If yes, ask to be notified when it is returned to service. Leave a
call back number and then OnTyme the field engineering group.
.skip 1
.indent -4
2. Determine if there has been an environmental failure. Environmental
problems are defined as a loss of power, loss of air conditioning (A/C),
or a site fire. In the event of an environmental failure, proceed as
follows:
.skip 1
.left margin 21
.indent -3
* Ask to be notified when the environment returns to 
  normal.
.skip 1
.left margin 21
.indent -3
* Leave call-back information.
.skip 1
.fill
.justify
If the environment has returned to normal, continue the evaluation.
.skip 1
.indent -4
3. Have the site contact perform a visual inspection of the node.
Determine if the node is in an operational state. If it is not, notify
Network Field Engineering of the outage. Specify the type of equipment
involved.
.skip 1
.indent -4
4. Perform an evaluation of associated equipment. Have the customer
visually inspect the modem or DSU for an obvious malfunction.
Perform tests on the DSU or modem as appropriate including 
loopback test and self tests.
.skip 1
.left margin 19
.indent -1
* If either of these test should fail, report the problem
  and results to appropriate Telco group or modem vendor.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5. If all of the above items prove inconclusive, then the problem
should be reported to Network Field Engineering.
.skip 1
.indent -4
6. If it is not possible to contact the site do to a ring-no-answer (R/NA),
a dump and reload of the node should be attempted.                            
.skip 1
.indent -4
7. During regular working hours, node outages will be reported to
the appropriate field engineering region via telephone, and then
followed up with an OnTyme (an OnTyme will also be sent
when the node returns to the Network).

6.  ALWAYS type ?HOST in the slot.  If "Dispatcher indicates slot is down"
shows, this is a definite response that the slot is down.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
7.  Should the slot be running a constant "RESTART", also referred to as
"crashing continuously", the "H" command should be issued.  This will halt
the slot.  (L.H. license is required for this command.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
8.  Type ?HIST for a history of any slot halts.  Look for the slot that is
being checked to see when it stopped running.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
9.  Exit from DDT by typing 2 "Z"'s.  
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
10. Run the CRASH program.  This may give some valuable information as to the
crash count of the slot as well as the crash id.  Manual examination of the
slot crash table can be done while in the slot using ISISII manual for cross
reference of crash table definitions.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
11.  Make certain the slot is halted and then dump the slot, using the "U" command in LOADII.  This will allow the
software support to analyze the software in the condition it was in when
the slot stopped operating.  (The kernel host of the target node and the target slot
number will be necessary for this step.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
12. Reload the slot using the "S" command in LOADII.  Load the production
code for the slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
13. Log back into the node containing the slot.  Repeat STEPs 3 through 6.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
14. If the slot is back up, there will be a report as to the condition of
the host when the ?HOST is issued.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
15. Should the slot still be down, the support agency should be notified
as soon as possible.  All information gathered in STEPs 9 and 10 (name of
the dump) should be passed onto them.                                                     
.skip 1
.left margin 18

I.   PURPOSE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
This procedure describes various ways in which a node running on the 
network can be forced to go to its BOOT for DOWNLINE access by LOADII
or ELF.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  REQUIREMENTS
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1. Access to the node directly or through a third party.
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2. Access to XRAY (with privileged status) in the target node.
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3. Access to DDT (with license L.SYA) in the target node.
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4. Access to PROBE with Status "10".
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III. PROCEDURES
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
A.  To send Engine or MiniEngine to its DOWNLINE BOOT manually:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Open the front door of the engine.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  Locate the toggle-switch on the right side of the Multi-Function 
card.  (The MF card is the fourth card down from the top of the card
cage.)
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  Lift the Multi-Function card toggle-switch against the internal
spring loading until it is fully up.  Then move the switch to the full
down position.
.skip 1
.left margin 28
.indent -6
NOTE: In some cases, the boot switch may be left in the center position,
ie. OFF position.  Normally, this will be done only in cases where it is
necessary to "Freeze" a node in its crash configuration to determine the
cause of the crash.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  The left most digit displayed on the front panel should begin to 
sequence from 0 through F repeatedly.  The right side of the front
panel will display the version of the boot resident in the Multi-Function
card.
.skip 1
.left margin 29
.indent -7
NOTE:  A MiniEngine will not necessarily be equipped with a front panel.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
5.  Close the front door of the machine.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
B.  To send a MicroEngine to its DOWNLINE BOOT manually:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Locate the Boot Switch on the rear of the machine.  The switch will
be a protected pushbutton and will be marked "BOOT".
.skip 1
.left margin 22  
.indent -4
2.  Depress the Boot Switch and release it.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3. The "RUN" indicator on the front panel should be illuminated.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  The machine will now be running in its DOWNLINE BOOT.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
C.  To Boot an Asynchronous Terminal Concentrator (ATC) manually:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  The ATC boot brings the entire node's code into memory from the node's
internal PROMs.  (Booting an ATC does not load a DOWNLINE BOOTSTRAP.)
.SKIP 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  To Boot the code into the ATC's memory, turn the power switch OFF,
wait for ten seconds and then turn the power switch ON.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  The machine will then initialize and begin to run it's code.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
D.  To force a Micro, Mini or Engine to it Boot via PROBE:
.skip 1
.left margin 25
.indent -6
NOTE:  For this procedure to work the machine must be on the network.
       Also, be aware that this procedure is the preferred method of 
       forcing a node to its Boot through the network.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Log into PROBE in the active supervisor.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  At the PROBE prompt, type: DLOAD xxxx (where xxxx is the number of the
node you wish to have go to its Bootstrap).
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  If the command fails to send the node to its Boot, it is probably
because:
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
a. The MiniEngine or Engine Boot switch on the Multi-Function card is 
disabled, ie. in it's center rather than down position. (See Note in STEP 
III.A.3)
.left margin 26
.indent -4
b. The MicroEngine has been internally optioned to prevent DLOAD
commands from forcing the machine to it's Boot.
.left margin 26
.indent -4
c. Attempt Procedures V. and VI. if this procedure fails.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
E.  To force a Micro, Mini or Engine to BOOT via XRAY:
.skip 1
.left margin 25
.indent -7
NOTE:  For this procedure to work the machine must be on the network.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Log into XRAY in the target node.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  Set privileged status in XRAY.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  Type: BT in response to the XRAY prompt.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  Attempt Procedures IV. and VI. if this procedure fails.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
F.  To force an ISIS Micro, Mini or Engine to it Boot via DDT:
.skip 1
.left margin 25
.indent -7
NOTE:  For this procedure to work the machine must be on the network and
       the copy of the bootstrap left in memory from the last booting
       operation MUST be intact.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Log into DDT in the target machine.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  In response to the SLOT? prompt, type: !
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  At the next DDT prompt, type: ?SLOT .
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  If the slot is identified as FF proceed.  Otherwise get into Slot FF.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
5.  In response to the DDT prompt, type: G 5A
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
6.  In a few seconds the machine will leave the network and your DDT 
circuit will drop.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
7.  If you cannot access the machine then through LOADII or ELF, you will
have to assume that the copy of the Boot resident in memory was corrupted
and you will have to have the machine MANUALLY booted.
.skip 2
.left margin 15
COMMENTS:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Putting a machine into its boot will interrupt all of the service being
provided by the machine. It should also be remembered that preferred
sequence of methods attempted to force a machine to its boot is:
.skip 1
.left margin 25
.nofill

I. OVERVIEW
.left margin 18
.skip 1
A condition that necessitates loading code which includes:
The introduction of a new version of code, a change in the
local configuration, or reloading after a maintenance procedure.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
II. DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
A. DLOAD: The process by which the first few instructions of
executable code are entered into the node. This forces the online machine
to go into the boot
strap program (leave the network), and await further instruction.
.skip 1
.indent -4
B. RELOAD: A downline loading program used to load a binary image of
executable code and interface parameters into a Tymnet technology network.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
III. PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
A. Choosing a neighbor node: The controller must be able to build
a virtual circuit from the host system running the LOADII program or from ELF
to the neighbor node and then to the node to be reloaded. The neighbor
node must be running and under the Supervisors control. It must
also have passthrough capacity. To act as a downline loading neighbor,
the machine must be running a downline loadable version
of code itself. Some Bisync Varian Tymcoms do not meet this requirement.
.skip 1
.indent -4
B. DELOADing and RELOADing Engines: No special instructions are required
other than choosing the correct neighbor and line number. *** WARNING:
Physical lines 2,3,6,7,10,11,14 and 15 do not raise request to send signals while
running the boot strap. This may cause a loss of some records. It is
therefore prefereable to choose a line which does raise request to send.

I.###PURPOSE
.LEFT MARGIN 15
This procedure is intended as a guideline for individuals attempting to
control routing paths within the network.                              
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.##DEFINITIONS
.LEFT MARGIN 15
Shut. A condition known to the Supervisor that eliminates a particular link
from consideration in the cost algorithm used in data routing. Note that 
a shut is on the link level, not on the line level.
.skip 1
Line. A  connection between two or more points over which data is
transmitted. One or more comprise a link.
.skip 1
Link. A communications path between any pair of nodal communications 
processors. Telecommunications equipment and procedures for transmitting
information between locations in the network.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.#REQUIREMENTS
.skip 1
.left margin 18
1.  Access to PROBE with STATUS 20 license.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
IV.##COMMENTS
.SKIP 1
.LEFT MARGIN 18
.INDENT -3
A.#A shut, or multiple shuts, is used by network control to handle routing
problems caused by anomalies or project work.  It constitutes the removal of
a link or node from the network.
.skip 1
.indent -3
B.#Nodes should always have one link to the network left open          
(un-shut), and all links to dead-ended nodes should remain open (un-shut).
.skip 1
.indent -3
C.#Multiline-links do not require a shut if maintenance is to be performed
on a link while the link is still up. The exception to this is when a 56KB
multiline-link is involved, and the line to be removed is the 56KB section
and not the 9.6KB back-up.
.skip 1
.indent -3
D.#When a failure occurs in a 56KB primary line, a shut is placed on the
whole link until the 56KB line is restored to the network. This keeps
its 9.6 back-up from becoming overloaded for a sustained period.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
V.###PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -3
A.#Shuts may be entered and removed with the following commands:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
1.#PROBE commands to enter shuts
.left margin 21
a.#NSHUT XXXX
.left margin 24
Shuts all of the links on the node specified by XXXX
.left margin 21
b.#ESHUT XXXX YYYY
.left margin 24
Shuts the link between nodes XXXX and YYYY
.left margin 18
2.#PROBE commands to remove shuts
.left margin 21
a.#CLEAR XXXX
.left margin 24
Removes shuts from an entire node
.left margin 21
b.#RSHUT XXXX YYYY
.left margin 24
Clears a shut between nodes XXXX and YYYY
.left margin 21
.indent -3
3.#The process of entering and removing shuts requires only that a choice
be made of the commands to be used.  The choice would be based on the
existing situation.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Use of NSHUT and CLEAR would be appropriate for shutting and removing shuts
on all links attached to a node while ESHUT and RSHUT would be appropriate
for shutting and clearing a single link.

.indent -4
2.  Loopback the suspected port(s) in one of the three following ways:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
a.  By removing the ASYNC RIBBON CABLE(S) from the edge of the ASYNC Board
and installing TYMNET ASYNC LOOP-BACK PLUGS (P/N AST6-1) in place of the
ribbon cable(s).
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
b.  By installing TYMNET loop-back plugs on the appropriate Engine 
connector-panel jacks.  (Use P/N AST7-1 for 37pin connectors, P/N 
630030-001 for 25pin connectors)
.skip 1
.left margin 22

3.  Load SLASYN.NIB into the appropriate slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  Log into DDT in the target machine, transfer to the appropriate slot
and gain access to the SLASYN diagnostic.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  Establish the parameters for SLASYN which closely approximate the
conditions on the port when it is failing.  Signal toggling should
normally be enabled during testing.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  Reset and Start the diagnostic then display the results periodically
to observe the testing process.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
7.  If the test fails, the appropriate hardware support agency should
be called upon for assistance.  When the problem is reported cleared
verify that the SLASYN diagnostic runs by repeating STEPS 3 though 6.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
8.  Insure that the proper production is loaded into the slot and verify
with DDT that the slot is running.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
9.  Make certain that all loopbacks are removed and the cables are
connected.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
10. Verify with the person reporting the problem that service has, in
actual fact, been restored.
.skip 2
.left margin 15
COMMENTS:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
When the diagnostic SLASYN.NIB is loaded into a slot, all production service
in that slot will be interrupted.  However, service in other slots within the
target machine will not be affected.

1.  This message indicates that the REAL NODE in NET-B has gone out of the
network or the circuit for the gateway has been lost.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  Verify that the REAL NODE is up by snapping it in PROBE in NET-B.  If
node is down, follow procedure to restore node to a network, once it is back
up, the gateway will come back up.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  If REAL NODE is up, the indication is then that the circuit has been 
lost between NET-A and NET-B.  Turn the circuit over to Telco to test the
line.  If Telco reports no problem found and gateway is still shut, SLSYNC
should be run to determine which end has the problem.  Follow the procedure
"TROUBLE-SHOOTING NON-HARDWIRED INTERNODAL LINES".

COMMENTS:
.SKIP 1
.left margin 18
STEPs IV.2 and IV.3 require access to NET-A utilities which may not be 
available to the user of this procedure.  In such a case, the user should 
contact NET-A's customer service group and request that they perform STEPs
IV.2 and IV.3.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  This message indicates that the node in NET-A containing the gateway    
slot code is out of the network, or that the slot containing the gateway code
has stopped operating.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  To check if node is up, snap it in PROBE in NET-A.  If the node is
down, follow the procedure to bring a node back up.  Once node is back 
up, the gateway will come back up.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
.test page 7
3.  If the node is up, snap the gateway host number in PROBE in NET-A.
If "NO SUCH HOST", the slot is down.  Follow the procedure to bring a
slot back up.  The host will show as "shut" for a moment, once slot is running 
again.  This is the time it takes for it to initialize and establish contact.
Once the host is "ANSWERED" in PROBE, the gateway will be back up.

This procedure defines the steps taken when the "Port Spewing Characters"
message is received.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Port Spewing Characters can be defined as a 
condition where an asynchonous port is in an open condition and
continuously floods the Network Supervisor with characters.  If this
condition is allowed to continue, it could possibly cause the active
Network Supervisor to crash.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Sample of TMCS Logger Message:
.left margin 18
*4/29/83 23:02:28   node #PORT port# <in decimal> SPEWING CHARACTERS <30>
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The specified async port is running without restriction and flooding the
supervisor with logon characters.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  Do a retake of the node 'SPEWING CHARACTERS'.  This will cause the
active Supervisor to take another look at that particular node and hopefully
reset the port that is 'SPEWING CHARACTERS'.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  If STEP 1 is not successful, try to have access to the port disabled by
calling the site and either:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -1
*having the modem busied out if the port connects to a modem
.left margin 42
or
.left margin 18
.indent -1
*having the terminal turned off if the port is hardwired to a terminal
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  If STEP 2 is not successful, take the node down and reload it.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  If a reload does not correct the problem, DLOAD the node and leave it
down until hardware support can be obtained at the node site.

.SKIP 1
.left margin 14
A.  Obtaining LINE SPEED and STATUS
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Log into PROBE in the active supervisor for the network containing
THE LINES WHICH ARE TO BE CHECKED.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  To determine the current LINE SPEED and STATUS (Shut, Out Frozen)
can be obtained by using PROBE's "NODE" command.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
The resulting PROBE output will contain the desired information under the
heading LINK STATUS.
.skip 1
.LEFT MARGIN 39
.indent -13
PLEASE NOTE: An OUT status indicates a link is in the process of being returned
             to service after outage.
.skip 1
.left margin 39
If a link is out of service and attempts are not being made to restore it to
service, there will be no indication of the link under LINK STATUS.
.skip 1
.left margin 39
SHUT indicates that a network operator has taken the link out of service.
.skip 1
.left margin 39
FROZEN indicates that the link has been detached but has not yet been
declared down.

B.  Obtaining a LINK LOGGER REPORTS, both Historical and Realtime
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  A HISTORY  of link reports or the ability to MONITOR link reports in 
realtime can be obtained with the PROBE "RNODE" "LOG" commands.  The
resulting output will contain link reports for all links on the specified 
node.  It is not possible with PROBE to restrict link reports down to a 
single link.  If TMCS is available, it's ability to restrict to a specific
link would make it a more logical choice for obtaining this type of 
information.

1.  Using PROBE place a SHUT in the line and using the ND command in XRAY determine if the
number of users on the line is sufficiently low to proceed to STEP 2   
where the line will be taken down.

4.  Install the breakout box on Port x but do not connect the cable to the
breakout box.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  Using LOADII or ELF, attempt to load LINTST.REL through Port x of NODE
A.  (The breakout box will act as the target for the load)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  If the terminal logged into the load utility (LOADII or ELF) displays
any indications of "Lost Data", you are receiving an indication of errors
and NODE A will require servicing.  After servicing has been completed, go
to STEP 14.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
7.  If LINTST.REL loads without losing data, disconnect the breakout box
from Port x and connect the breakout box to the cable end which was initially
disconnected from Port x.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
8.  Terminate any "loading" of LINTST.REL currently underway through NODE A
and attempt to do a load of LINTST.REL through Port y of NODE B.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
9.  If the load utility being used does not indicate any lost data, go to
STEP 11.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
10. If data is being "lost", remove the breakout box from the cable,
disconnect the cable from Port y of NODE B and connect the breakout box
to Port y of NODE B. (Do not connect the cable to the breakout box.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
11. Stop and restart the load of LINTST.REL through Port y of NODE B.
If data is still lost, NODE B will require servicing.  If data is not
lost, either the cable is bad or the drivers and/or receivers on Port y
are not able to drive the cable's electrical load.  In either event servicing will be
required.  After the servicing is completed, go to STEP 14.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
12. Make certain that the cable is reconnected to Port x of NODE A and
disconnected from Port y of NODE B.
.skip 1

13. Connect the breakout box to the cable end removed from Port y but do
not connect the breakout box to Port y.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
14. Terminate any loads which are in progress and restart the loading of
LINTST.REL through Port x of NODE A.  If data is lost during the load,
you may be observing a cable program but you are probably observing an
inability of NODE A to properly drive the cable's electrical load.

III. PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 16
.indent -4
A.  For synchronous slot lines equipped with modems, proceed as follows:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  Run a loopback test between the modems on the line.  (Return modems
to normal configuration after test is completed)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  If the loopback test fails, run a self test on the modems.  (Return
modems to normal configuration after test is completed)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  If the self tests fail, turn the problem over to the agency responsible
for the maintenance of the modems and go to STEP 18.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  If the self test passes, turn the problem over to the appropriate
telephone service group and have loopbacks run to the CIU's at both ends
of the line.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  If the loopbacks fail, turn the problem over to the telephone service
group for resolution and go to STEP 18.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  Using the Node and Slot TYM files or using the ?LU command in DDT,
determine if the suspect line is driven by SYNC Brd or by SIO Brd 
hardware.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
7.  If more than one logical unit is assigned to the slot, use the Node
TYM files, Slot TYM files and notes on the configuration of the network
to determine which logical unit is suspect.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
8.  If the line is supported by SYNC hardware, load SLSYNC.NIB into 
the slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
9.  If the line is supported by SIO hardware, load SLSIO.NIB into the
slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
10. Log into the slot diagnostic just loaded and assign the suspect logical
unit to the diagnostic.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
11. Place the modem cabled to the suspect logical unit in analog (line)
loopback.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
12. Start the slot diagnostic and periodically display the test results.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
13. If the slot diagnostic fails, turn the problem over to the appropriate
hardware support agency and go to STEP 18.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
14. If the slot diagnostic runs without error, have the modem taken out of
loopback and have the distant modem placed in digital loopback.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
15. Stop, Reset and Restart the slot diagnostic.
.skip 1 
.left margin 18
.indent -5
16. If the diagnostic now fails, you have either a modem or line problem
not detected in previous testing.  Have the problem cleared by the appropriate
support agency and go to STEP XX.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
17. If the diagnostic does not fail in STEP 16, the node and slot code 
should be considered suspect and the terminal or host device at the end of
the line should be checked for malfunction.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
18. Insure that the production code is loaded into the slot and that the
production code is running.  Use DDT to verify this.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
19. Insure that loopbacks are removed from all modems.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
20. After the problem is found and thought to be corrected, verify with
the person reporting the problem that service has been restored.
.skip 1
.left margin 16
.indent -4
B.  For synchronous slot lines which are hard wired directly to user 
equipment, proceed as follows:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  Using the Node and Slot TYM files or using the ?LU command in DDT,
determine if the suspect line is driven by SYNC Brd or by SIO Brd hardware.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  If more than one logical unit is assigned to the slot, use the Node TYM
files, Slot TYM files and notes on the configuration of the network to 
determine which logical unit is suspect.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  If the line is supported by SYNC hardware, load SLSYNC.NIB into the slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  If the line is supported by SIO hardware, load SLSIO.NIB into the slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  Log into the slot diagnostic just loaded and assign the suspect
logical unit to the diagnostic.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  Discount the user equipment and place a breakout box in the circuit so
that date and control signals can be looped back towards the engine.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
a.  Jumper the breakout box as follows:

.fill
.justify
.skip 1
.left margin 22

b.  Check the breakout box to see if transmit and receive clocks are still
available.  If they are missing, they must be reacquired before proceeding.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
7.  Start the slot diagnostic and periodically display the test results.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
8.  If the slot diagnostic fails, turn the problem over to the appropriate
hardware support agency and go to STEP 10.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
9.  If the diagnostic does not fail, the node and slot code should be
considered suspect and the terminal or host device at the end of the line
should be checked for malfunction.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
10.  Insure that the production code is loaded into the slot and that the
production code is running.  Use DDT to verify this.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5
11.  Insure that loopbacks are removed from all modems.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -5

COMMENTS:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
When SLSYNC.NIB or SLSIO.NIB is loaded into a slot all production 
service in that slot is interrupted.  However, there is no interruption
to the service provided by other slots within the machine.

I.  Tracing a Circuit from a Stand-Alone Tymsat
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Determine the port number in the Stand-Alone Tymsat where the circuit
originates.
.skip 1
.left margin 29
.indent -6
NOTE: Three methods exist for determining the origination port number in a
Stand-Alone Tymsat.  Use any one of the following techniques:
.skip 1
.left margin 28
.indent -4
1.  Obtain the origination port number (in decimal form) from the login
string displayed on the terminal.
.skip 1
.left margin 40
.indent -12
Example:####Please type your terminal identifier
.left margin 40
-2300-263-
.left margin 40
please log in:
.skip 1
.left margin 28
The origination port number is 263 (Octal) which converts to 179 (Decimal).
.skip 1
.left margin 28
.indent -4
2.  Use the XRAY command, AS U, before the user logs in and again immediately
after he logs in to detect the port on which he has landed.  The port number
will be displayed in Octal in the PORT field of the XRAY output.  Convert
the Octal port number to its Decimal equivalent.

XRAY indicates that port number 263 appeared after the login.  The Octal 
number 263 then is converted to its Decimal equivalent, 179.
.skip 1
.left margin 28
.indent -4
3.  Use the PROBE command PSTAT immediately before and immediately after the
login to display the origination port number.  (The PSTAT response will
display the port number in its Decimal form.)

Notice that after the login Port 6 dropped but that was not of consequence to
us.  But also notice that Port 179 appeared coincidentally with the login
so Port 179 is the origination port number.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  Perform the circuit trace using Probe TRACE command.
.skip 1

II. Tracing a Circuit from an ISIS Slot Port
.skip 1
.left margin 18
If a circuit originates in at a port assigned to an ISIS slot, the path from
the port to the network is:
.skip 1
.left margin 32
.indent -4
1.  From the user port to the slot's dispatcher port.
.left margin 32
.indent -4
2.  From the dispatcher port to Slot 0's port into the network.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The internal ISIS circuit path is depicted below.  The diagram also shows
the port numbers which the DDT query ?CT will return when the query is made
in the interface slot, Slot X, and in the node slot, Slot 0.

The tracing method recommended below is not the most efficient means of doing
a trace because it presumes that the USER's port number is not known or if the
port number is known, it is presumed that the port cannot be correlated with
the Dispatcher Port Number.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
1.  Determine the Dispatcher port number at the port of origination of the 
circuit.
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -4
1.  Log into DDT in the slot from which the user circuit will be originating
and type ?CT before the user circuit is built.
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -4
2.  After the user circuit is built, again enter the DDT query ?CT from the
origination slot.
.skip 1
.left margin 28
Example: Response to ?CT before login:

3.  Convert the Hexidecimal Network Port Number to its decimal equivalent
and perform the network circuit trace using the Probe command TRACE.
.skip 1
.left margin 40
.indent -12
Example: It was determined that the Network Port Number is equal to 0E which
converts to a Decimal Network Port Number of 14.

I.   PURPOSE
.SKIP 1
.left margin 18
To determine what data is being sent to the supervisor on a command circuit
for a login that is being flagged as garbage or as a security violation.
.SKIP 2
.left margin 10
II.  SCOPE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Many bad login attempts are caused by poor Async data.  This data is garbled
by the communication equipment on the engine.  This procedure helps 
determine which.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III. PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  Log into XRAY on the effected node with a super privileged name.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  Set license in XRAY.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  Issue a "TD 20" command with a printer turned on.  ("20" represents
the sup command port.  It will always be 20
and 21.)
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  Issue a "TA 20" command with the printer turned on.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  Issue a second "TA 20" command.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  Look at the data for login request and the username.  If the name is 
readable, someone or program may be trying to get in.
.skip 1
.LEFT MARGIN 18
Many times the data will be garbage.  The "TA" command displays ASCII 
characters for the bit patterns.  This data may cause your terminal to
do unpredictable things.
.skip 1
.left margin 25
.indent -7
NOTE:  The XRAY logic will not display passwords.  No one can get to them. 
This command does not pose a security problem.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
7.  If you see garbage, halt and restart the node or slot (whichever is
applicable).  When DTR is present on an Async terminal port during initialization, the port is
hung on startup.  If the garbage continues immediately after the start,
then Tymnet hardware should be suspected.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
8.  If the problem does not reappear, then terminal equipment is suspect.

I.   PURPOSE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The procedure outlines some of the processes by which an orderly transfer of
responsibility between shifts can be effected.
.skip 2

.left margin 10
III. OVERVIEW
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The purpose of a Shift Turnover procedure is to make it possible for one
network operations shift to replace another shift with the least possible
impact on the operation of the network.  The principal aspects of the
turnover are:
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
1.  Shift Turnover Forms filled out by operations specialists.
.left margin 26
.indent -4
2.  A Problem Log or Ticket System.
.left margin 26
.indent -4
3.  A review of TMCS and/or PROBE indications of the network's health.
.left margin 26
.indent -4
4.  A verbal briefing given by the shift being relieved.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
IV.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  During the course of shift, it will become obvious that certain
activities will not be completed during the shift.  Personnel should
make notations on a Shift Turnover Form relative to such activities and
should provide sufficient information for the next shift to take any
necessary action.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
a.  During the process of the actual shift turnover, the Shift Turnover forms
should be collected from the existing shift personnel and turned over to the
new shift's personnel for review and subsequent action.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
b.  If the shift going off duty received Shift Turnover Forms from the
shift it replaced and some items on those forms have not been resolved,
those forms should also be turned over to the new shift.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
c.  Once completed, all Shift Turnover Forms should be kept on file for one
week.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  A review of Trouble Log entries or open Trouble Tickets should be
conducted between the old and new shifts to:
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
a.  Bring outtages to the attention of the new shift.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
b.  Make the new shift aware of any difficulties in getting existing 
problems cleared.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
c.  Prevent duplication of effort.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
d.  Preclude the possibility of a problem being allowed to go unresolved.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  The new shift should cross check the NODE, HOST and LINE OUTTAGES 
reported by TMCS against the current Trouble Log or against the open 
Trouble Tickets to ascertain that all existing anomalies are being
addressed.

The ability to have a single terminal logged into multiple hosts and
utilities is essential to a network operations group.  Another feature    
of the Tymnet MUX is its ability to be used as a realtime communications
device.

1.  When usernames are "genned" into the MUX slot code, both LABELING
and HEAR parameters should be specified.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  A sufficient number of names should be "genned" into the MUX code and
validated on the network for the MUX host so that all network operators
have access to the MUX.
.skip 1
.left margin 18

IV.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.LEFT MARGIN 18
.INDENT -4
A.  Using the MUX for Multiple Host and/or Utility Logins:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
1.  Log into the MUX
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  At the MUX prompt, type: M xxxxxxxx
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -1
(where xxxxxxxx = a label you would like to assign to the port being
used for the circuit that is about to be built)
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  At the "PLEASE LOG IN" prompt, you proceed with a normal login process
appropriate for the desired host or utility.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
4.  To return to the MUX command level, type: (ESC)Z
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
5.  If you wish to build another circuit, go to STEP 2 again.                
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
6.  To transfer from a terminal circuit and return to the MUX command
level, you simply type: (ESC)Z .
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
7.  To transfer from the MUX command level to an existing circuit,
simply type: S xxxxxxx  (xxxxxxx = circuit label, see STEP 2).
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
8.  To backpressure a circuit, you must have the terminal currently
connected to the circuit and there must be at least one other
circuit built.
.SKIP 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
a.  Then simply type (ESC)B and the circuit to which your terminal is 
connected will be backpressured and your terminal will transferred to the
next circuit.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
b.  To release backpressure, you need only transfer back into the 
backpressured port by either transferring to that port from the MUX 
command level or by transferring to it from another circuit by typing
(ESC)B or (ESC)G .
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
9.  If circuits are not backpressured, any output from those ports will
be labeled and displayed on the terminal.  It is possible to display the 
output of a running logger, for instance, while also displaying the output
of a code loading facility such as LOADII or ELF.  You can, therefore,
watch the load proceed, know when the load ends and observe the logger
indications of the node and/or slot's return to service.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
B.  Using the MUX for Direct Terminal to Terminal Communications
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  If a network is spread out around the world, communications costs 
related to network operations can be reduced by utilizing the 
MUX's TALK and HEAR capabilities.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  If you have need to communicate with someone, type: WHO at the 
MUX's command level.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  If the user with whom you desire to communicate is logged in proceed as
follows:
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
a.  At the MUX command level prompt, type: HEAR ON
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
b.  Again at the MUX command level prompt, type: TALK xxxxxxx
.skip 1
.left margin 30
.indent -1
(where xxxxxxx = user name with whom communications must be established)
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
c.  Everything you type will now be transferred to the desired user as soon
as you terminate your input with a carriage return.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
d.  As soon as the other user performs STEP B.3.a and STEP B.3.b, whatever he types will
be transferred to your terminal when he types a carriage return.  
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
e.  To terminate the session, (ESC)Z should be typed.                         
The output of your terminal will now be directed back to the command level
within the MUX and the other user will no longer receive your terminal
output.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
f.  The other user should perform STEP IV.8.e to terminate his session with
you.  You may type HEAR OFF if you wish to discontinue your receipt of his
message before he terminates the session.
