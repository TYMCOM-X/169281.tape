I.  PURPOSE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
This procedure defines the process by which TMCS, XRAY and PROBE are used
by Network Control.  A detailed description of TMCS, XRAY and PROBE and
their uses is documented in their appropriate manuals located on
Tymshare's System (NETDVDOC:33).

II.  DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  PROBE:  PROBE is a utility package that resides on all Network
Supervisors.  It allows you to query all of the Network nodes, lines
and host interfaces and control some supervisor functions.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  TMCS:  The Tymnet monitoring and control system is an inter-active
system which provide multiple users with selective access to the status
of the Tymnet Technology Network.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  XRAY:  XRAY is an interactive monitoring and debugging system that
provides a real-time window into a Tymnet II node.  Through it, the
user can conveniently display information about the node's configuration,
performance and history.  Remember, this is only the local node.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  PROBE:  Network Control should have at least five (5) terminals
logged into PROBE at all times.  One (l) should be logged into the
active Supervisor and the others should be logged into our standby
supervisors.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
.TEST PAGE 5
A.  The username "NETCON" will only be used by the pilot of the
Network.  All other PROBE terminals will be logged in using the
username of "NETCON2".  Remember, there should never be two (2) 
"NETCONS" logged into PROBE at the same time.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
B.  The standby terminals after being logged into PROBE,
and the printer turned on, should have an
"LOG S" command issued.  This command serves two purposes:
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
1.  It starts a logger by seconds on the active Supervisor.
.skip 1
.left margin 26
.indent -4
2.  It will give you the last time the inactive Supervisor went to
sleep.  Also, if the Sup had taken a crash, the time the crash occurred.
The inactive Supervisor paper log is also set to run in this mode, should
one of the inactive Supervisors start a Takeover.

3.  XRAY:  XRAY provides a real-time window into a Tymnet II node.  
Through it, the user can conveniently display information about the node's
configuration, performance and history.  XRAY also has commands to monitor 
the status of a node's links, trace activity and isolate problems in
the node.  Last (and perhaps least) XRAY is a debugging tool for
programmers who can use it to diagnose nodecode and network bugs.

.skip 1
.left margin 18
This procedure defines the process by which an Ontyme message may be
sent out via Tymnet's Network.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Ontyme - Tymnet's electronic mail message switching service.  This
service allows messages to be sent and received on terminals.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The considerations and procedures used to send out Ontyme messages are
detailed in the Ontyme Elementary Manual.  The current release of the
manual will be contained in a binder located in Network Control marked
"Ontyme Elementary Manual".
.skip 1
.left margin 18
When sending out Ontymes, a Network Controller will log in to the
system and always specify the date, time and who is to receive the
message.  The text should be clear and direct.  It should be constructed
in a professional manner.  The Ontyme should be signed with your Ontyme user
name.  See Example (1).
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Any time you use the Netcon user name, you must copy Netcon on the
Ontyme message.  When building files, private or public, use the
"Ontyme Elementary Manual" for a reference guide.
.page
.skip 3
.left margin 18
When sending an Ontyme to more than one person, you should use the
star files previouslyy created.  This is a list of the files with an
example of when to use them:

.LEFT MARGIN 10
I.###PURPOSE
.LEFT MARGIN 15
.skip 1
This procedure outlines actions to be taken in the event of a Network
Node Outage.
.SKIP 1
.left margin 10
II. DEFINITION
.SKIP 1
.left margin 15
NETWORK NODE OUTAGE:  A network node outage  is defined as a 
node which is not accessable, nor can it be accounted for by the network
Supervisor. This may result from a hardware/software malfunction, or
a transmission facility company problem.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
III. PROCEDURE
.SKIP 1
.left margin 15
In the event of a public network node failure, Network Control will
follow the procedure below to restore service:
.skip 1
.left margin 15
.indent -4
A.  Wait for ten minutes to determine if the outage will clear itself (i.e.
power failure).
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1. If the outage clears, record the outage per existing documented procedures. 
.skip 1
.indent -4
2. If the problem does not clear, proceed to the next step.
.skip 1
.left margin 15
.indent -4
B. Site Evaluation: This step involves calling the site 
of the nodal location for evaluation of Telco equipment, machinery 
environment, customer equipment and nodal hardware. It will be 
necessary to call the site and locate someone that is familiar with
the node and its associated equipment.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1. Determine if the customer has taken the node down for any reason.
If yes, ask to be notified when it is returned to service. Leave a
call back number and then OnTyme the field engineering group.
.skip 1
.indent -4
2. Determine if there has been an environmental failure. Environmental
problems are defined as a loss of power, loss of air conditioning (A/C),
or a site fire. In the event of an environmental failure, proceed as
follows:
.skip 1
.nofill
.nojustify
* Ask to be notified when the environment returns to 
  normal.
.skip 1
* Leave call-back information.
.skip 1
* Send OnTyme to the regional field engineering personnel.
.skip 1
.fill
.justify
If the environment has returned to normal, continue the evaluation.
.skip 1
.indent -4
3. Have the customer perform a visual inspection of the node.
Determine if the node is in an operational state. If it is not, notify
netowrk field engineering of the outage. Specify the type of equipment
involved.
.skip 1
.indent -4
4. Perform and evaluation of associated equipment. Have the customer
visually inspect the modem or DSU for an obvious malfunction.
Perform tests on the DSU or modem as appropriate including 
loopback test and self tests.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.nofill
.nojustify
* If either of these test should fail, report the problem
  and results to appropriate Telco group or modem vendor.
.skip 1
* Send an OnTyme to maintenance to advise of status.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.fill
.justify
.indent -4
5. If all of the above items prove inconclusive, then the problem
should be reported to Netowrk Field Engineering.
.skip 1
.indent -4
6. If it is not possible to contact the site due to a ring-no-answer (R/NA),
Netcon will attempt to dump and reload the node (notify the maintenance group
via OnTyme).
.skip 1
.indent -4
7. During regular working hours, node outages will be reported to
the appropriate field engineering region via telephone, and then
followed up with and OnTyme (an OnTyme will also be sent
when the node returns to the Network).

This document specifies the procedures to be used for all Network
Host Interface Outages.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Host Interface Outage.  The definition of a host or slot interface
outage is when the host or interface is unaccessable through the
Network, and is showing shut, down or missing.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
This procedure needs the concurrent work of network control, field
engineering, customer service and the communications consultants.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  Network control is responsible for detecting host anomalies on
hosts which are normally answered 24 hours a day.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  Upon detection of an anomaly (down, shut or missing) network control
will make an evaluatin of the slot code and notify customer service.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  For the purpose of reporting, network control will be responsible
for contacting field engineering and customer service will be responsible
for contacting communications consultants.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  Network control will determine within means whether an anomaly
is hardware or software caused.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  When a determination cannot be rendered, Field Engineering will
be contacted to have tthe line and modems tested.  Normal follow-up
will be used.
.page
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  If the line is tested okay and the anomaly has not been cleared
then the problem will be turned over to customer service.  A line
outage will then be handled by Netcon through a phone company.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
7.  Customer service will be responsible for getting a communicatin
consultant notified and working on the anomaly.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
8.  If a communicatin consultant feels that the transmission medium
is not functioning properly than software and hardware people will
work together as a team to correct the problem.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
9.  All line problems will be turned over to the phone companies
via network control.

I. PURPOSE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
This document specifies the procedures to be used for all synchronous 
network line outages.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II. DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
A. Network Line Outage: Loss of the availability of a network node to 
communicate with any other node via a transmission medium. This would include
leased telephone company provided circuits.
.skip 1
.indent -4
B. Types of lines:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1. Hardwired Lines: A connection between two nodes. The nodes cannot be more than 
four-hundred (400) feet apart. They are connected from synchronous port to 
synchronous port without the use of modems to transduce the digital data signals.
.skip 1
.indent -4
2.  Optical Coupled:  A high speed connection between two nodes which uses
coaxial cable. This is also a form of Hardwired circuit. The transmission
medium handles current loop transmission instead of digital data as in a 
hardwired environment.
.skip 1
.indent -4
3. Long Line: A 3002 channel leased line from AT&T or it's competitor.
It may have Tymnet (CPE) modems or American Bell modems. It may also be leased
from any International Record Carrier.
.left margin 18
.skip 1
.indent -4
C. Identification
.break
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1. The primary tool used for identifying failure of the aforementioned lines
is the TMCS (NET PATROL) program. Each time a line, link or node fails,
it is reported by the NET PATROL logger. To detect line outages you should
be logged in under the username of 'colorline' or the username 'netcon'.
.page
.skip 1
Once the outage is detected on the TMCS logger or display, the controller may
verify the trouble by interrogating 'PROBE'. If the line is not functioning
PROBE will report the line as OUT (Tymnet I). If you are looking at a Tymnet II
node, the controller may see the line as OUT, but more often than not
the line will not be shown. Doing a SYNPRT command in PROBE will 
allow the contr to see all links on the Tymnet II node. 
.skip 1
Logging into XRAY via the Kernel host is a far better way to determine
the status of links (Tymnet II only). XRAY will report the last time that
the link went up or down, as well as report any error condition that may 
exist on a line.
.left margin 10
.skip 1
III. PROCEDURE - Domestic and International Line Outage
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
A. Generate an outage ticket for all lines that show OUT on the TMCS 
monitor.
.left margin 20
.SKIP 2
.indent -4
DOMESTIC
.skip 1
Refer to the circuit map file for the circuit number and reporting number.
.skip 1
.indent -4
A. If the circuit map states HW, this is a hardwired circuit and should
be reported to the appropriate maintenance region for repair.
.skip 1
.indent -4
B. If a circuit number and trouble reporting number are listed in the
circuit map, the controller should check to see if the circuit is connected to
the Analysis System. If the circuit is connected to the Analysis System
refer to the Analysis System procedures. If the circuit is not connected
to the Analysis System, refer the problem to the telephone company.
When the controller reports the circuit, he/she should report the
problem as 'unable to send or receive data'. The controller should
request the ticket number that the telephone company has assigned to the problem.
The controller should also request the initials of the person at Telco that
wrote the ticket.
Once the ticket has been referred to the 
telephone company, the controller should
notify the appropriate maintenance region of the status (ie. out to Telco).
.skip 1
.test page 6
In the event that Telco clears the line as no problem found (ie found
good loops and levels), the ticket should be then referred to the
appropriate maintenance group for further investigation. This referral
can be done either over by phone or by OnTyme (use OnTyme for non-prime
time referrals).
.skip 1
.indent -4
C. In the event that the controller is unable to locate the circuit number for
the line in question, he/she must request the circuit number from the 
responsible maintenance region. In the event that the outage should
occur at a non-prime-time hour, the controller should sent an OnTyme
to the responsible maintenance group advising them of the outage 
(maintenance does not pursue line outages after prime time - the
exception being hardwired circuits).
.skip 1
.indent -4
D. In the event that the controller is unable to locate the
telephone company trouble reporting number for the circuit, he/she
should contact our ATT dedicted account representatives.  If the
outage should occur after hours, the controller should record
the reason that he/she was unable to turn the problem
out to Telco.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
.nofill
.nojustify
** Note: ALL tickets that need referral to the telephone 
   company should go through Network Control. If a 
   maintenance or technical group should request a referral 
   to Telco, they must give a valid reason for the referral.
.fill
.justify
.left margin 20
.skip 1
.indent -4
INTERNATIONAL
.skip 1
Determine which International Record Carrier (IRC) is responsible for the
circuit.
.skip 1
.indent -4
A. If the circuit runs from a domestic site to an international sit (ie
Newark, New Jersey to Paris, France), the circuit should be reported to
the appropriate IRC. The controller should record the name of the person
at the IRC which took the trouble ticket information.
.skip 1
.indent -4
B. For Japanese line outages the controller must follwo specific
procedures for restoration of Japanese overseas lines.
.skip 1
.indent -4
C. Should the circuit run from an overseas point to an overseas point
(ie. Paris to Rome), the controller should OnTyme both maintenance
regions involved. NETCON should be copied on all
OnTymes sent. Updates should be sent at least once each shift.
.skip 1
.NOFILL
.NOJUSTIFY
.LEFT MARGIN 10
** NOTE: Status should be checked and recorded at least 
   once every two (2) hours. Staus should be sent to 
   all maintenance parties involved, as well as all IRC's 
   involved. If the controller receives any new or additional
   information (ie. circuit number or trouble reporting 
   number) this information should be given to the shift 
   supervisor. Any questions regarding this procedure   
   should be directed to the shift supervisor.

II.  DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18

A.  Accounting Blocks - This is a space on a Supervisor's disk that
stores accounting daytas.  The space is divided into 4305 (variable)
accounting records.  The raw information is stored in 1000 characters per
block.  When the blocks reach zero, the Supervisor starts writing over old 
accounting information.

B.  Collector - This program creates a duplicate of the accounting
blocks, providing a backup file of the disk's information.  If the
maximum 20,477 (variable) accounting records are filled, causing the
Supervisor to start writing over old information, the old information is
not lost.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The accounting blocks should be monitored through all shifts.  This is
accomplished by watching the color monitors and using PROBE's "ACCT" command.
.skip 1
When 50% of the total available accounting blocks are left, a message
will be displayed across TMS color monitors.  The latest accounting
block total will be displayed until either the Supervisor is changed, or
more than 50% of the blocks become available.
.skip 1
A message of 50% of less availability signifies a Collector danger zone.
The Supervisor must be changed to avoid having old information "written"
over".
.page
.left margin 18
At the danger zone, and after every Supervisor change, the Collector
program should be checked for proper operation.
.skip 1
Collector checks are implemented via the following steps:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Log into System 74 (i.e. NETCON;74;password).
.skip 1
.indent -4
2.  Set system license (i.e. 0 All - carriage return;NETCON-carriage return;
password).
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The following Collector features should be checked:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Do a systat command (see example).  Check to make sure that PJ is
logged in.  This will be under the job name "PAM".
.skip 1
.indent -4
2.  Check to make sure that Collector is logged into the active Supervisor.
Check to see if it is creating files for the current date.  The job name 
will be "CPN###".
.skip 1
.left margin 18
If either PJ or Collector are not logged in, call Fremont.  The System 74
operator will have instructions for manually restarting PJ.  They are
outlined as follows:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  NetCon should instruct the system operator to log-off the job running
under username PJ, and shut the system.
.skip 1
.indent -4
2.  The operator will log the job off and shut the system by typing 
"SCHED 40000" at the exec level.  The operators have the license to
do this.
.skip 1
After a few minutes, the operator will unshut the system.  On System
74, the operator will restart PJ manualy.
.skip 1
Within 15-20 minutes, COLLECTR should be started automatically by PJ.
.page
.left margin 18
To verify that COLLECTR and PJ have successfully restarted:
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Do a systat to see that they are logged in for the current date.
.skip 1
.indent -4
2.  Do a systat on "PAM" job number followed by "CONT" (for continued).
This will show PJ running.
.skip 1
.indent -4
3.  Do a systat on COLLECTR number followed by CONT.  The two (2) digit
numbers in the fourth (4th) column should change periodically to show
COLLECTR progress.  Example - syst(COLLECTOR)/CONT.
.skip 1
.indent -4
4.  The Supervisor should be changed when there are 500 accounting blocks
left available.  TSTAT and ACCT commands should be performed on a
Supervisor before moving to it.  This will give the status of the
Supervisor and its available disk storage space (4305 accounting blocks
for public neworks; 27,000 for private networks).
.skip 1
.indent -4
5.  If COLLECTR and PJ are both logged in but do not appear to be
collecting, notify Fred Cannon or Nancy Burriesci.

I.###PURPOSE
.LEFT MARGIN 15
This procedure is intended as a guideline for individuals attempting to
control routing paths within the network. Any individual having access
authority to PROBE will be required to use this structured approach.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.##DEFINITIONS
.LEFT MARGIN 15
Shut. A condition known to the Supervisor that eliminates a particular link
from consideration in the cost algorithm used in data routing. Note that 
a shut is on the link level, not on the line level.
.skip 1
Line. A  connection between two or more points over which data is
transmitted. One or more comprise a link.
.skip 1
Link. A communications path between any pair of nodal communications 
processors. Telecommunicatyions equipment and procedures for transmitting
information between locations in the network.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.#PROCEDURE
.SKIP 1
.LEFT MARGIN 18
.INDENT -3
A.#A shut, or multiple shuts, is used by network control to handle routing
problems caused by anomalies or project work.  It constitutes the removal of
a link or node from the network.
.skip 1
.indent -3
B.#Project oriented shuts are used to limit the amount of pass-throughs
that a particular node  or communications link carries. Anode scheduled for
temorary removal from the network should have its traffic restricted to
a minimum prior to the scheduled outage.
.skip 1
.indent -3
C.#Individuals having a status of 20 in PROBE are capable of initiating
shuts on links, facilitating rapid reaction to a variety of situations.
.skip 1
.indent -3
.test page 3
D.#Any shut(s) placed on a network line must be reported to
Network Control via telephone or OnTyme. This report should be made
before the shut occurs, or within a 30 minute timeframe.
.skip 1
.indent -3
E.#Shuts degrade circuit building and response times, and Network 
Control personnel will remove unidentified shuts at their discretion.
.skip 1
.indent -3
F.#Nodes will always have one line which enters the network left open
(un-shut), and all dead-ended neighbors left open (un-shut).
.skip 1
.indent -3
G.#Dead-ended customers will not be denied access to an interface until
it is removed from the network.
.skip 1
.indent -3
H.#Multiline-links do not require a shut if maintenance is to be performed
on a link while the link is still up. The exception to this is when a 56KB
multiline-link is involved, and the line to be removed is the 56KB section
and not the 9.6KB back-up.
.skip 1
.indent -3
I.#When a failure occurs in a 56KB primary line, a shut is placed on the
whole link until the 56KB line is restored to the network. This keeps
its 9.6 back-up from becoming overloaded for a sustained period.

III PROCEDURE
.skip 1
When the Network Controllers have determined that the Network Supervisor
has failed, they should take the following steps:
.left margin 18
.SKIP
.indent -4
1. Contact the manager for Network Control.
.break
.SKIP
.indent -4
2. Check to see that the stand-by terminals are logged in and that they
are operational.If stats indicate that more than one Supervisor is active
sleep any Supe which is:
.SKIP
.left margin 20
.indent -2
- Active, but known to be an unacceptable Supe (as specified by the shift
supervisor).
.break
.indent -2
- Is higher in number than any other Supe which is awake.
.break
.left margin 18
.skip 1
.indent -4
3. Call Computer Operations. Request assistance from one of the operators.
Have the operator look at the display pannel to identify the indicator in the
right most oposition. The following displays are possible:
.SKIP 1
.left margin 20
.indent -2
- Digit alternating between 0 and 1. This indicates that the Supe is inactive
and is recovering from a crash.
.page
.break
.indent -2
- Digit alternating between 0 and 2. This indicates that the 
Supe is inactive, and probably does not
have working Supervisor or Kernel software.
.break
.indent -2
- Digit alternating between 0 and 3. This indicates that the Supe is inactive,
frozen, or off of the run queue.
.break
.indent -2
- Digit alternating between 0 and 4. This indicates that the Supe is 
inactive and sleeping (go to step 6).
.break
.indent -2
- Digit alternating between 0 and 5. This indicates that the Supe is active (
go to step 4).
.break
.indent -2
- Digit not alternating. This indicates that the Supervisor node code
is looping or is haulted.
.left margin 18
.skip 1
.indent -4
4. If more than one Supe is active (alternating 0 and 5), the Supe with
the highest number should be powered down. This is accomplished by
turning off the machine with the keyed power switch located on the left
side of the console. Restore power to the machine after waiting three (3)
minutes.
.break
.skip 1
.indent -4
5. Continue to monitor the Supes *.
.left margin 20
.break
.skip 1
.indent -2
* Do nothing if you can't talk via PROBE to an acceptable back-up Supe. If
there is no active Supe within ten (10) minutes go to step six (6).
.indent -2
* Awaken an acceptable back-up via the TWAKE command in PROBE and then go
to step nine (9).
.left margin 18
.skip 1
.indent -4
6. If there is still not an active Supe after ten (10) minutes,
turn the key to 'on' on both engines. Simultaneously press the 'INI'
button for the lowest numbered acceptable Supe.
.break
.skip 1
.indent -4
7. If there is not an active Super after ten (10) minutes, repeat the 
procedure in step 6 on the next higher Supe number. Repeat this procedure
every twelve (12) minutes until you run out of Supes. When you run 
out of Supes, go to the donut wheel and buy two (2) dozen donuts. Bring
them back for your fellow operations personnel to eat while they scan the
want-ads, and update their resume's.
.break
.skip 1
.indent -4
8. Monitor the takeover. If all looks good, and you can log-in, congrats!
If it doesn't, go back to step 7.

Dumps Node/slot - This is a release of all software in a node/slot to
be stored for examination at a later date.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
A.  Dumps should be performed on all nodes that drop out of the network.
This is accomplished by a program named Load II.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  Each dump should have its own file name.  The file name will start
with the node name and end with DMP, and one character for the shift
(D,S,M) followed by the day of the month.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  If you are unsure if there is a previous dump file on a particular
node, a directory (DIR/TOD) should be performed on 'NDxxx.*'.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
3.  If there is a previous dump file (ND267l.DMP), the next file should
be numbered (i.e. ND267l.DP1, ND267l.DP2, ND2671.DP3, etc.).  If you
name the file the same as a previous one, all previous information
will be cleared.  The new information would be written in place of the
previous information.
.skip 1
.left margin l8
NOTE:  At no time should a dump be dumped into any other directory then
Netcon's.
.page
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
B.  Only a 'C' dump should be performed on all nodes that are
available to perform a 'C' dump.  See example (1).  This dumps only
the crash table of a node, occupies minimal disc storage and utilizes
a minimum of c.p.u. time.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
1.  If the node is not able to be dumped through a 'C' dump, a 'D'
dump should be performed.  A 'D' dump dumps all of the software memory
in a node.  See example (2).
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
2.  When dumping a varian machine, you must specify a FINISH address in
octal (base 8).  This will vary according to the size of memory in each
node. The address for each memory size is listed below:

dump a slot on an ISIS node.  See example (3).  This is the V function
in Load II>  The file name should be ND2366.DS1.

This procedure is to define the process by which the change neighbor command
is used.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Change neighbor command - This command enables a user to change the
indicated neighbor on a line in the nodes memory.  The Supervisor
will not make this change to its node descriptor table until a retake
occurs.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The change neighbor command should only be used when a network node
cannot be taken down during a scheduled protect reconfiguration, or
if a neighbor to a dead-ended node is to be reconfigured, or upgraded
to a Tymnet II.  This command should only be used for temporary conditions
until the actual changes can be made in the code, and the nodes are
reloaded to refect these changes.  Example:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.nofill
.nojustify
CN  Node X  Line Y  Node Z
X = The constant node number
Y = The line number in node X
Z = The new neighbor number to which the line is to be connected.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.fill
.justify
A notation in the log book is made when this command has been issued.
Note:  The change neighbor command does not apply to Tymnet II nodes.
If the node is reloaded with the same generation of software the patch
will be lost.

.skip 4
I. PURPOSE
.skip 1
This document describes the process used for transferring outage tickets
and other information from one shift to the next.
.skip 2
II. DEFINITION
.skip 1
Turnover is the process of transferring information about outages reported and
actions taken during one shift to the next/previous shift's personnel.
.skip 2
III. PROCEDURE
.skip 1
Separate turnover procedures have been set up for current-shift personnel and
for next-shift personnel.
.skip 1
A. Current-shift procedures
.skip 1
One hour before the end of the shift, a summary of all node and host
outages must be sent out. It should include the date/time an outage was
reported, as well as the most recent status of the outage. It must also
account for the shut table in PROBE and give status of all Supervisors.
This summary should be created on System 70 and copied to Systems 25
and 28 (see Example).
.skip 2
At 22:45GMT a hard copy of TMS display for hosts, nodes and lines must
be snapped. Corresponding outage tickets must exist, and should have been
updated within the last 2 hours. All outages should have been referred to
the proper support group and a record kept on each ticket.
.skip 2
Hard copies of PROBE's Exc, and LShut should be available.
.skip 2
.test page 5
Copies of the Supervisor Incident Reports and the Close Out Log
should be stapled to filed closed out tickets. Copies of the
Supervisor Incident Reports and the Close Out Log should be
deposited in the Network Control Manager's IN basket.
.skip 3
B. Next-shift procedures
.skip 1
Read the log book for the two previous shifts. Look for problems
or requests for action pertinent to the upcoming shift. Initial all
log book pages read. Take a hard copy of all Ontyme hosts and accounting 
blocks. Attach this to the log book.
.skip 2
Check all terminals, making sure they are logged into the proper
programs. The pilot position should be logged into PROBE
under the user name "Netcon". Check all Supervisor Standby and
Consolidator terminals for proper login. Get information from
previous controller about all abnormalities observed.
.skip 2
Check Ontyme and project book for any items that may need action during
upcoming shift. Put all projects on clip board.
.skip 2
Examine all incomplete projects for most recent/accurate status.
.skip 2
Check Collector for proper operation (as described in Collector procedures).
.skip 2
Check the previous shift summary against all outstanding open node
and host outage tickets. Check that the outage ticket's most recent
status description is the same as that of the Shift Summary.
.skip 2
Check the L-shut table against the previous Shift Summary. Make sure all
shuts are accounted for with brief descriptions.
.skip 2
.test page 9
Take a hard copy of the TMS display for nodes, lines, and hosts at 14:45GMT.
Verify that an outasge ticket has been generated on all outages displayed
on the hard copy. Check that the last status of the outage tickets have 
been updated within the last 2 hours. Verify that all outages 
which should have been referred to Telco, Customer Service, or the 
maintenance regions have been relayed. Review each ticket, making sure
that all procedures have been followed properly.
.skip 2
Check all monitor tickets for validity. Make sure that resolutions have
resulted in closed out tickets.
.skip 2
Read all Netcon mail.
.skip 2
Note: Oversights or inaccuracies must be corrected by the previous
shift's supervisor or controller.

III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
At the end of each shift, network control staff is required to publish
a report via Ontyme called the End of Shift Project Summary.  This report
should be concise on all projects attempted, as well as completed for
that shift.  The report should be generated on Ontyme and sent out to
*projects.  Hardcopies on the project summary should be attached to
the shift turnover report for that specific shift, as well as one on the
project clip board.

The following procedure describes the manner in which NETCON or NETAPS can
contact the on-call HQ Technical Support person for assistance on a software
problem.
.skip 2
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  If NETCON or NETAPS receives a call reporting a software problem, the
calling party is asked if the problem concerns:
.skip 1
a.  OnTyme; Outdial; or Railtrack, OR
.skip 1
b.  A Public Network customer, OR
.skip 1
c.  A Private Network
.skip 1
.indent -4
2.  If the call concerns OnTyme, Outdial, or Railtrack, it is directed to
NETCON and NETCON enters 408-262-8746; 1000 to contact the on-call person
supporting these applications.
.skip 1
.indent -4
3.  If the call concerns the Public Network (with the exception of the
applications covered by #2, above), it is directed to NETCON and NETCON 
enters 408-262-8746; ESCL to contact that support person.
.skip 1
.indent -4
4.  If the call concerns a Private or Independent Network, it is directed
to NETAPS and NETAPS enters 408-262-8746; PNET to contact the on-call support
person.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
When making contact with the appropriate on-call individual, the controller
should send a message describing the problem and a contact phone number to
be called.  The on-call person must inform the controller that they have
received the message.
.skip 1
If there is no response within ten (10) minutes, NETCON should re-try the
number just dialed and re-send the message.  After an additional ten (10)
minutes has passed (20 minutes after the original call), NETCON or NETAPS,
as appropriate, should enter 408-262-8746; MGMT, and send the original message.

III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
A.  ACTIVE SUPERVISOR CRASH.  When a Network Controller has determined
that the active Network Supervisor has failed or crashed, they should
take the following steps:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
1.  Check to see if the standby terminals are logged in and operational 
If they are, please awaken the Back-up Supervisor if no Sup has started
takeover.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
2.  After gaining control of the Network, log into the Supervisor that
has crashed, if possible.  Run a log back using the command in PROBE
(:LOG 5LS) to determine the nature of the crash.  This command will
give you the last 5 lines from the Supervisor prior to it crashing.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
3.  If it can be determined what caused the crash, then notify the
appropriate group.  Hardware problems are handled by the field engineering
group and software related problems should be reported to the NTD.  Note:
The NTD is not to be called after midnight, unless we're unable to get a
running supervisor.  All other problems will be reported to the Supervisor
Support Group the next morning.
.page

B.  INACTIVE SUPERVISOR CRASH.  An inactive Supervisor crash is handled
in the same fashion as an Active Supervisor, only you do not have to awaken
another supervisor.
.skip 1
.left margin l0
Network Operations is now responsible for publishing STATISTICS on the
operation of the supervisor.  In order to accomplish this successfully,
it will be necessary for us to improve the quality of information on our
supervisor incident reports.  With this in mind, please implement the
following policies with regard to the reporting of Supervisor problems:
.skip 1
.left margin 10
1.  A supervisor incident report should be completed anytime the supervisor is
moved.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
2.  A supervisor incident report should be completed anytime the active supervisor
fails to process log ins for two minutes or more.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
3.  Each supervisor incident report should be completed in its entirety with
as much information as possible.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
4.  A supervisor incident report should be completed anytime peak log in times
exceed 20 seconds and average log in times exceed l0 seconds for a duratin
of 3 minutes or more.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
5.  Any crashes of a supervisor machine should be logged.  This includes
crashes or inactive supervisors as well as the active supervisor.

.skip 1
.left margin 18
          TRACE active-supervisor-sport#-node#
.fill
.justify
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Description:  The TRACE command traces a circuit in Tymnet II from a
specified host and port on a specified node.  It also traces the Tymnet II
portion of a circuit that crosses from Tymnet I into Tymnet II.  The  trace
information consists of a list of Tymnet II nodes the circuit passes
through.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
Following is a sample command and response sequence tracing a circuit
ending on Tymnet II node 2005, host 125, and port 5:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.nofill
.nojustify
:TRACE 2005 H125 5
HOST 125 PORT 5 2005 2010 2017 NODE 1306 CHANNEL 27
.SKIP 1
.LEFT MARGIN 18
.fill
.justify
Note that the previous circuit traced in the example crossed into
Tymnet I.
.left margin 18
.skip 1
When tracing this same circuit starting from the Tymnet I portion,
PROBE types the Tymnet II node number TII (#) where # is the decimal
channel number used on the link from the Tymnet I node to the Tymnet II node.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.nofill
.nojustify
Example:
.skip 1

:CT 1303
TII (27) 2005 1306 1326 1303 P19
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The syntax to trace the Tymnet II portion of the circuit is:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
TRACE tymnet II node #  Ntymnet I node#  channel#
.skip 1
.left margin 18
A sample command/response sequence is:
.skip 1
.left margin 18
:TRACE 2005 N1306 27
NODE 1306 CHANNEL 27 2017 2005 HOST 125 PORT 5
.fill

NOTE:  The user should be aware that this command generates data
flow in the network and may have a slow response time.

IV.  LIMITATION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  There is only one trace buffer in the Supervisor.  This limits
one execution of the trace command until the buffer is cleared.  If you
get data back and it appears wrong, you may have someone elses command.
The issuance of trace command is sent to the logger in order to alert you of the
buffer uses.

The procedure defines the way the standby Supervisors are utilized.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
II.  DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
The standby Supervisors are five (5) terminals located within Network Control.
Each terminal will be logged into one of the Network Supervisors, via
PROBE>  One terminal will have an active Supervisor, the other terminals
will be logged into the other four (4) Supervisors in a "ready" state.
.skip 2
.left margin 10
III.  PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
1.  The standby Network Supervisor terminals should be the first item
checked when starting turnover.  Each should be logged in via PROBE into
Hosts 121, 122, 123, 124 and 125.  The username will be "standby".  There
are three primary phone numbers used for accessing the Network, these
numbers are located on the side of the Supervisor 1 standby terminal.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
2.  Checking the standby terminals, you should verify that the terminal
is logged into the correct Host.  Check to see that the terminal has
a sufficient amount of paper.  Check and verify the "TIME", the (DF)
Drowiness Factor and the state of the standby supervisor.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
If a Supervisor is found to have a (DF) Drowiness factor other than
(0) zero, and/or in a state other than Active or Sleeping, should be noted in
the Network Control logbook.  Check wih the offgoing shift for the
current status on these Supervisors.  Also, a Network Control Incident 
ticket should be open until the problem is resolved.
.page
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
3.  A "LOG S" command will be issued on all standby Supervisors.  This will give
us a logger by seconds on the Active Supervisor.  On the other Supervisors,
we should get the last time that particular Supervisor went to sleep,
whether by command or otherwise.  Each terminal should be set to run on
hardcopy, except the Active Supervisor.  The purpose of the hardcopy is
to give a record of takeover, should the active Supervisor fail and a
standby Supervisor automatically starts taking over the Net.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
4.  If there is a problem with one of the terminals used for accessing
the standby Supervisors, another terminal within Network Control will be
designated as a standby terminal until the regular terminal is repaired.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
5.  Each standby terminal should be checked at least three (3) times during
each shift, not including turnover.
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
6.  Problem with the standby Supervisors and terminals should be reported to
the appropriate people.
.skip 1
.left margin 22
.indent -4
A.  Being unable to log into a sleeping standby Supervisor should be reported
to the Manager of Network Control or designate, and NTD contacts.

I. OVERVIEW
.left margin 18
.skip 1
A condition that necessitates loading code which includes:
The introduction of a new version of code, a change in the
local configuration, or reloading after a maintenance procedure.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
II. DEFINITION
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
A. DLOAD: The process by which the first few instructions of
executable code are entered into the node. This forces the machine
online to go into the boot
strap program (leave the network), and await further instruction.
.skip 1
.indent -4
B. RELOAD: A downline loading program used to load a binary image of
executable code and interface parameters into a Tymnet technology network.
.skip 1
.left margin 10
III. PROCEDURE
.skip 1
.left margin 18
.indent -4
A. Choosing a neighbor node: The controller must be able to build
a virtual circuit from the host system running the LOAD II program
to the neighbor node or the node to be reloaded. The neighbor
node must be running and under the Supervisors control. It must
also have passthrough capacity. To act as a downline loading neighbor,
the machine must be running a downline loadable version
of code itself. Some Bisync Varian Tymcoms do not meet this requirement.
.skip 1
.indent -4
B. Choosing a line: There are differences between loading an Engine, and
loading a Varian. A Varian may have up to sixteen (16) lines. Only
the first eight (8) can be used for loading. Engines may have up
to thirty-two (32) lines, of which the first sixteen (16) may be used
for loading. Whenever possible it is recommended that a hardwired line
be used for loading both the Engine and the Varian.
.skip 1
.indent -4
C. DLOADing Varians: It is always recommended to  the neighbor on
line zero (0) when possible. Varians must always have the line number 
of the neighbor chosen
specified when DLOADing, and the same line number and neighbor must be
used for RELOADing.  (If a line number is omitted from the command, a
zero is assumed.
.skip 1
.page
.indent -4
D. DELOADing and RELOADing Engines: No special instructions are required
other than choosing the correct neighbor and line number. *** WARNING:
Physical lines 2,3,6,7,10,11,14 and 15 do not raise request to send signals while
running the boot strap. This may cause a loss of some records. It is
therefore prefereable to choose a line which does raise request to send.
