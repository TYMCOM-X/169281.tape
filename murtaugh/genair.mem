                      NOTE: The points at  which  to  loopbacks  occur  are
                      depicted above.

              1.  If the problem is link error-rates, Log into XRAY in each
                  of the nodes into which the link terminates.

                  a.  Type: ND in XRAY in both nodes to obtain WINDOW SIZE

                  b.  Compare the WINDOW SIZE parameter for the  link.   If
                      they   do  not  match,  the  TYM  file(s)  should  be
                      corrected and the new code should  be  generated  and
                      loaded into the machines.

                  c.  The health of the line/link should then be  monitored
                      to determine if the errors on the line have stopped.

                  d.  If the problem has been cleared, you need proceed  no
                      further.

              2.  Using PROBE place a  SHUT  in  the  line  and  when  XRAY
                  indicates the number of users on the line is sufficiently
                  low, proceed to STEP 2.

              3.  Run a self test on both modems.  If either  modem  fails,
                  request service on the modem and then go to STEP 13.

              4.  Run an end-to-end test between the modems to  verify  the
                  line  condition.   If the test fails, service on the line
                  and possibly one  or  more  modems  is  required.   After
                  servicing, go to STEP 13.

              5.  Place MODEM A and MODEM B in AL loopback (LL  if  digital
                  modems are being used.)

              6.  Using either LOADII or ELF  start  a  load  of  the  file
                  LINTST.REL from NODE A toward NODE B.

              7.  If the load utility shows that data is being "lost",  you
                  have  an  indication  that  either  NODE A is at fault or
                  there is a cabling problem between NODE A  and  MODEM  A.
                  (A  fault  in  MODEM A which was not detected during self
                  testing is  also  remotely  possible.)  After  corrective
                  action has been taken, go to STEP 13.

              8.  Terminate any loads in progress and using LOADII  or  ELF
                  start  a  load  of the file LINTST.REL from NODE B toward
                  NODE A.

              9.  If the load utility shows that data is being "lost",  you
                  have an indication that either NODE B is at fault or that
                  there is cabling problem between NODE B and MODEM B.   (A
                  fault   in   MODEM   B   which  is  not  detected  during
                  self-testing is also remotely possible.) After corrective
                  action has been taken, go to STEP 13.

             10.  If no faults have been discovered thus  far,  verify  the
                  modem  end-to-end  test  by  placing  MODEM  B in DL (RT)
                  loopback.  MODEM A should be out of loopback.

             11.  Terminate any loads in progress and using LOADII or  ELF,
                  load LINTST.REL through NODE A toward NODE B.  Any "lost"
                  data will indicate a previously undetected line or  modem
                  problem.  After servicing is completed, go to STEP 14.

             12.  Take MODEM B out of loopback and place MODEM A in DL (LT)
                  loopback.

             13.  Terminate any loads in progress and using LOADII or  ELF,
                  load LINTST.REL through NODE B toward NODE A.  Any "lost"
                  data will indicate a previously undetected line or  modem
                  problem.

             14.   After  servicing  to  clear  any  faults,   verify   the
                  effectiveness  of  the  servicing by rerunning those test
                  which failed.

             15.  Take all modems out of loopback and terminate  any  loads
                  which may be in progress.

             16.  Observe the line with PROBE, XRAY  and/or  TMCS  for  any
                  further indications of trouble.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                            GATEWAY FAILURE AND RECOVERY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This   procedure    describes    the    techniques    for
                  trouble-shooting a failure of a gateway and its recovery.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access to both networks involved with gateway.
                  2. Knowledge of TYM files.
                  3. Access to XRAY and DDT in both networks.
                  4. DDT license required: L.Halt, L.E., L.SOA
                  5. Access to SLSYNC diagnostic.
                  6. Access to loading facility, LOADII.
                  7. Access to circuit numbers and Telco trouble numbers.
                  8. Ability to run SLSYNC diagnostic.


               COMMENTS:

                  For procedural purposes, we will identify the 2  networks
                  involved by letter.

                  NET-A will contain the following:
                  GATEWAY HOST NUMBER
                  GATEWAY SLOT CODE
                  SYNC LINE TO NET-B (referenced in TYM file for slot  with
                                     gateway code) 

                  NET-B will contain the following:
                  PSEUDO NODE NUMBER
                  SYNC LINE TO NET-A (referenced in TYM file for slot 0  of
                                     the  REAL  NODE  that  the  gateway is
                                     connected to)
                  REAL NODE (has the physical connection of the  sync  line
                                     for  the  gateway  via  slot  0.   The
                                     PSEUDO NODE  will  be  listed  as  the
                                     neighbor.)

GATEWAY FAILURE


               GENERAL INFO:

                  Circuit number on both sides of the gateway is always the
                   same.
                  Gateway pseudo-node number is always TYMNET I (less than
                   2000).


          III.  PROCEDURE FOR "HOST SHUT"

              1.  This message indicates that the REAL NODE  in  NET-B  has
                  gone  out  of  the network or the circuit for the gateway
                  has been lost.

              2.  Verify that the REAL NODE is up by snapping it  in  PROBE
                  in  NET-B.   If node is down, follow procedure to restore
                  node to a network, once it is back up, the  gateway  will
                  come back up.

              3.  If REAL NODE is up,  the  indication  is  then  that  the
                  circuit  has been lost between NET-A and NET-B.  Turn the
                  circuit over to Telco to test the line.  If Telco reports
                  no problem found and gateway is still shut, SLSYNC should
                  be run to determine which end has  the  problem.   Follow
                  the procedure to run SLSYNC.


          IV.  PROCEDURE FOR "HOST NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH NET"

              1.  This message indicates that the node in NET-A  containing
                  the  gateway slot code is out of the network, or that the
                  slot containing the gateway code has stopped operating.

              2.  To check if node is up, snap it in PROBE  in  NET-A.   If
                  the  node  is  down, follow the procedure to bring a node
                  back up.  Once node is back up,  the  gateway  will  come
                  back up.

              3.  If the node is up, snap the gateway host number in  PROBE
                  in  NET-A.   If "NO SUCH HOST", the slot is down.  Follow
                  the procedure to bring a slot back  up.   The  host  will
                  show  as "shut" for a moment, once slot is running again.
                  This is the time  it  takes  for  it  to  initialize  and
                  establish contact.  Once the host is "ANSWERED" in PROBE,
                  the gateway will be back up.

                              CLEARING PORTS IN PROBE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  To free a job in PROBE to allow access to it.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Must be logged into PROBE.
                  2. Must have "01" status in PROBE.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  All the PROBE prompts are the ":".

              2.  At the prompt, type: "WHO".  This will list all the users
                  logged  into PROBE with the left hand list indicating the
                  "job label".  This job  will  identify  the  user  to  be
                  removed.

              3.  At the next prompt, type "HANG 'x'" with  'x'  being  the
                  job label of the username to be removed.

              4.  At the next prompt, type: "WHO" again to verify that  the
                  job label has cleared.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                         MOVING LOGICAL UNITS IN ISIS SLOTS



          I.  PURPOSE 

                  This procedure allows a  user  to  move  a  logical  unit
                  within an ISIS slot and from one slot to another.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access to node with DDT.
                  2. "SYS" license required to move L.U.
                  3. Knowledge of TYM files.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Check the TYM file for the Logical Unit (L.U.) that is to
                  be moved.

              2.  Log into the node with DDT, containing the slot with  the
                  L.U.  to be moved.

              3.  At the "slot#" prompt, put in the number  of  the  source
                  slot with the L.U.  that is to be moved.

              4.  Once the "*" prompt is displayed the user is connected to
                  the slot.

              5.  Type in ?LU.  This will display  all  the  logical  units
                  assigned  to  the slot and hardware referenced to each in
                  the TYM file.

              6.  Type in ?TRAN.

              7.  At the "Source L.U." prompt, type in the  number  of  the
                  logical unit to be moved.

              8.  At the "Destination slot" prompt, type in the  number  of
                  the slot the L.U.  is moving to.

              9.  At the "Destination L.U." prompt, type in the number  the
                  L.U.  will be in the slot is moved to.

MOVE LOGICAL UNITS


                         (All responses are expected in hexadecimal)

                         (The source and destination slot can be the same)

             10.   At  the  *  prompt,  issue  the^  (up  arrow)  and   the
                  destination slot number that L.U.  was moved to.

             11.  Type ?LU to verify that the L.U.  was moved and  that  it
                  has the correct number.


               WARNING:

                  In some interfaces, when transferring the L.U.   back  to
                  the  source  slot,  the  slot  will  halt.   It  will  be
                  necessary to restart it using the "E" command (EXECUTE).

              1.  At the asterick prompt (*), type "WHO".  This  will  list
                  the  ports in TMCS and the one with the * next to it will
                  be the one that the user is currently in on.

              2.  At the next * prompt, type "HANG XX", with "XX" being the
                  port number that is to be cleared.

              3.  At the next * prompt, type "WHO" again.  This will  again
                  list  the ports and then it can be verified that the port
                  is cleared by it being missing  from  the  list  of  port
                  numbers.


               COMMENT:

                  You may clear all  users  by  typing  "HANG  ALL"  and  a
                  carriage return.

                                CHANGING SUPERVISORS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure will outline the method  of  changing  the
                  supervisors.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access to PROBE on both supervisors involved in the
                       change.
                  2. 01 status is required in PROBE on both supervisors to
                       alter their state.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.   Log  into  PROBE  on  the  active  supervisor  and   the
                  supervisor  that  is  to  be  brought  up  as  the active
                  supervisor.

              2.  All PROBE commands are issued at the ":" prompt.

              3.  Issue the "COUNT" command.  This will give a count of the
                  nodes   that  are  currently  controlled  by  the  active
                  supervisor.

              4.  Issue the "LSHUT" command.  This will give a list of  the
                  links that are shut throughout the network.

                       (You can compare these results with the results from
                        the supervisor that will become active.)

              5.  Issue to the ACTIVE supervisor the "TSLEEP" command.

              6.  At the PASSWORD prompt, type in the current  password  of
                  the  user  changing  the  supervisor  but  DO  NOT type a
                  "RETURN".

              7.  Issue to the "SLEEPING" supervisor the "TWAKE" command.

              8.  At the PASSWORD prompt, type in the current  password  of
                  the  user  changing  the  supervisors  but  DO NOT type a
                  "RETURN".

              9.  Type a "RETURN" on the supervisor that is to  be  put  to
                  sleep.  

             10.  Wait 10 seconds.

             11.  Type a "RETURN" on the supervisor that is to  be  brought
                  active.

             12.  Issue to "COUNT" and "LSHUT" commands on the  new  active
                  supervisor  and compare these results with the results of
                  STEPs 3 and 4.  Be sure all the nodes were taken over and
                  all the link shuts are in place.

             13.   If  they  are  the  same,  the  supervisors  have   been
                  successfully changed.

                           REMOVING USERS FROM ISIS SLOTS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure allows a user to clear another from a
                  specified slot.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  License to access slot

                        A.  L.SOA - License to log into slot 0
                        B.  L.SYA - License to log into slot 0FF (The  ISIS
                            System)
                        C.  L.E.  - Normal Execution  Access  (Permits  the
                            starting and halting of a slot) 

                  2.  DDT access to node


          III.  PROCEDURE 

              1.  Log into node with DDT which  contains  the  slot  to  be
                  cleared.

              2.  Type in a slot number other than the number of  the  slot
                  to  be cleared.  When the "*" prompt appears, the user is
                  connected to the slot.

              3.  Type "?WHO".  DDT outputs a  table  showing  the  current
                  status  of  each  slot.  The * to the right of the slot  
                  shows that you are the active user in that slot.   The  @
                  to the right of the slot # shows who are the active users
                  in the other slots.

              4.  Type in "?PORT".  Lists the users on  their  kernel  port
                  numbers.

              5.  Type in "?HANG XX".  With  "XX"  being  the  port  to  be
                  cleared.   This  command  clears the user from the kernel
                  port specified.

              6.  Type "?WHO".  To verify slot is now  cleared  of  the  @.
                  The  username  will remain.  Now slot is clear and can be
                  accessed.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                           ISIS SLOT FAILURE AND RECOVERY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This   procedure    describes    the    techniques    for
                  trouble-shooting  a  failure  of  an  ISIS  slot  and its
                  recovery.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Knowledge of TYM files.
                  2. Ability to use DDT.
                  3. Access to loading facility, LOADII or ELF.
                  4. Access to the SLOT CODE for the slot that is down.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Check TYM file to see what slot number  corresponds  with
                  the host number in trouble.

              2.  Log into  the  node  with  DDT  that  contains  the  slot
                  suspected of being down.

              3.  At the "slot#" prompt, type in the  number  to  the  slot
                  that is to be checked.

              4.  When the "*" prompt appears, the user is connected to the
                  slot.

              5.  Look for any greeting message  to  the  slot  that  might
                  indicate trouble, ie.  "HALTED" or "STOPPED", etc.

              6.  ALWAYS type ?HOST in the slot.  If "Dispatcher  indicates
                  slot is down" shows, this is a definite response that the
                  slot is down.

              7.  Should the slot be running  a  constant  "RESTART",  also
                  referred  to  as "crashing continuously", the "H" command
                  should be  issued.   This  will  halt  the  slot.   (L.H.
                  license is required for this command.)

ISIS SLOT FAILURE


              8.  Type ?HIST for a history of any slot halts.  Look for the
                  slot  that  is  being  checked  to  see  when  it stopped
                  running.

              9.  Exit from slot by typing 2 "Z"'s.

             10.  Run the CRASH  program.   This  may  give  some  valuable
                  information  as to the crash count of the slot as well as
                  the crash id.

             11.  Dump the slot, using the "U"  command  in  LOADII.   This
                  will  allow  the software support to analyze the software
                  in  the  condition  it  was  in  when  the  slot  stopped
                  operating.   (The  kernel  host  of the node and the slot
                  number will be necessary for this step.)

             12.  Reload the slot using the "S" command  in  LOADII.   Load
                  the production code for the slot.

             13.  Log back into node containing the slot.  Repeat  STEPs  3
                  through 6.

             14.  If the slot is back up, there will be a report as to  the
                  condition of the host when the ?HOST is issued.

             15.  Should the slot still be down, the support agency  should
                  be   notified  as  soon  as  possible.   All  information
                  gathered in STEPs 9 and 10 (name of the dump)  should  be
                  passed  onto  them.   There  may  be  a  problem with the
                  software or the hardware.

             16.  Exit the slot using the double "Z" command.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                             NODE FAILURE AND RECOVERY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This   procedure    describes    the    techniques    for
                  trouble-shooting a failure of a node and its recovery.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Knowledge of TYM files.
                  2. Ability to use XRAY.
                  3. Access to loading facility, LOADII or ELF.
                  4. Access to the NODE CODE for the node that is down.
                  5. Access to PROBE.
                  6. Access to NAD (not essential).


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Verify that the node that is down is not DEADENDED  (only
                  1  connection  to  the  network).   This  can  be done by
                  checking the TYM file for the node that is down  (Network
                  Configuration section).

              2.  If the node is deadended, check its only neighbor using a
                  probe snap to verify that the neighbor is up.

              3.  If the neighbor node is down, it must first  be  returned
                  to  the  network  before  the  original node can come up.
                  Should the neighbor be  down,  go  back  to  STEP  1  and
                  proceed  until there is a node that is up to be used as a
                  neighbor, then proceed.

              4.  Check the TYM file of the neighbor to get its KERNEL HOST
                  number.

              5.  Log into the neighbor node with XRAY and get the  LINE   
                  that goes to the node that is down.

              6.  Try a CRASH DUMP using LOADII.

NODE FAILURE


              7.  If a crash table address is received (valid or not),  the
                  crash dump has been received and is completed when "EXIT"
                  is displayed.  Go to STEP 12.

              8.  If a crash table is not received, the crash dump must  be
                  attempted from another neighbor and LINE   (get this info
                  using STEP 4).

              9.  If still no success, the  node  may  have  to  be  booted
                  manually.

             10.  Contact the site and request them to boot the  node.   To
                  boot a full engine or mini-engine, have the site open the
                  front door of the node and on the 4th board down there is
                  a silver toggle switch on the right side.  They must push
                  this switch all the way up and release it.  If it was  in
                  the  snapped down position originally, they should put it
                  back that way.  To boot a micro-engine, have  them  press
                  in the "BOOT" button on the back of the micro-engine.

             11.  If there is no one on site to boot the node, the hardware
                  support agency should be contacted to check out the node.

             12.  Once node is booted, repeat STEPs 5 and 6.

             13.  Reload the node with the production code, using the  same
                  neighbor and LINE   that was used in STEP 5.

             14.  If the node does not return to the network, try the  load
                  again.   If  the node still does not come up, contact the
                  support agency.

             15.  Verify node is back up with PROBE snap.

             16.  Verify all lines to node are back up by logging into node
                  with XRAY.

             17.  Analysis of crash dump can be performed using NAD and the
                  ENGDMP  program.  If there is no access to NAD or ENGDMP,
                  turn the crash dump over to the support agency.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                            TMCS: LINK/LINE PERFORMANCE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The purpose of this procedure is to define the methods by
                  which  information  relative to a link/line's performance
                  can be obtained with the utility TMCS.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access to TMCS in the target node.
                  2. Access to TMCS documentation.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              A.  Obtaining LINE SPEED and STATUS

                  1.  Log into TMCS

                  2.  At the prompt, type: LIS SEL

                  3.  Make certain  that  the  desired  LINK  and  LINE  is
                      included under the "LINKS" and "LINES" parameters.

                         (If the LINK or LINE is not  included  it  can  be
                          included again with the RESTORE command providing
                          both neighbors on the line or link  are  included
                          in  the  NODES  parameter  recovered  via STEP 2.
                          Example: RESTORE LINK 2001:2055)

                  4.  At the TMCS prompt, type: PROBE

                  5.  You may now issue Probe's  "NODE"  command  and  LINE
                      SPEED  and  STATUS  will be printed under the heading
                      "LINK STATUS".

                      NOTE: The status OUT means a link has been out and is
                             in process or returning to service.

                             The SHUT status indicates a  network  operator
                             has taken the link out of service.

LINE PERFORMANCE


                             The FROZEN status indicates that the link  has
                             been  detached  but  has not yet been declared
                             down.

                  6.  To return to TMCS from  PROBE  simply  type:  EXI  in
                      response to the PROBE prompt.

              B.  Obtaining LOGGER Reports for LINK/LINES

                  1.  Both Historical and Realtime  LINK  and  LINE  Logger
                      reports   can  be  collected  through  TMCS.   It  is
                      possible, in fact, to restrict the logger  report  to
                      just specific LINES and/or LINKS.

                  2.  Log into TMCS

                  3.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS SEL

                  4.  At the TMCS prompt, type the following:

                          IGNORE LINKS
                          IGNORE LINES
                          IGNORE EVENTS
                          IGNORE ISIS
                          RESTORE EVENTS 18 19 26 27 28 33 36 43 47 48 
                          RESTORE LINKS xxxx:yyyy wwww:zzzz  (Note 1)
                          RESTORE LINES aaaa:cc              (Note 2)
                          LOG bbbbbbbb                       (Note 3)

                      Note 1: xxxx yyyy and wwww zzzz are the node  numbers
                              on  which  the  LINK  terminates.   Skip  the
                              "RESTORE LINKS" command if LINK messages  are
                              not required.

                      Note 2: aaaa is a neighbor number on a line and cc is
                              a port number which could be obtained through
                              XRAY's  "ND"  command  or   through   PROBE's
                              "SYNPRT"  command.   If LINE messages are not
                              required, skip the RESTORE LINES command.

                      Note 3: bbbbbbbb represents the number of minutes you
                              wish  to  have the logger backed up or it can
                              represent the DATE and TIME (GMT) from  which
                              you want the logger to start.

                                       EXAMPLE:  LOG 304
                                                 LOG 07/22/85 12:15

                  5.  TMCS will now output link and  line  logger  messages
                      for  those  lines and links specified in the "RESTORE
                      LINKS" and "RESTORE LINES" commands indicated in STEP
                      B.4 above.

LINE PERFORMANCE


                  6.  By changing the events used, it is  possible  to  see
                      very  specific  logger  messages.  Reference the TMCS
                      documentation for identification of message numbers.

              C.  Using the TMCS DISPLAY Mode

                  1.  Log into TMCS 

                  2.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS SEL

                  3.  Verify that LINES and LINKS of interest are selected.

                         (Use the "RESTORE LINKS", "RESTORE LINES", "IGNORE
                          LINKS"  and "IGNORE LINES" commands to adjust the
                          SELECTIONS to the existing requirements.)

                  4.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS PRO

                  5.  In the first line of the  response  a  terminal  type
                      will be identified just to the right of the user name
                      with which you logged into TMCS.

                  6.  If your terminal is not comparable  to  the  terminal
                      type  identified  in the LIS PRO output, use the TMCS
                      "TER" command  to  set  TMCS  up  for  your  specific
                      terminal.

                              Type: TER ? in response to the TMCS prompt to
                                     obtain  a  list  of  possible terminal
                                     types.

                              Type:  TER  xxxxxxx  to  set  TMCS  for  your
                                     terminal.    (where   xxxxxxx   =  the
                                     terminal type)

                  7.  Now in response to the TMCS prompt, type: DISPLAY

                  8.  A display listing LINK/LINE condition  will  then  be
                      presented.   Node  and  host  conditions will also be
                      displayed.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                             MUX IN NETWORK OPERATIONS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The  ability  to  have  a  single  terminal  logged  into
                  multiple  hosts  and  utilities is essential to a network
                  operations group.  Another feature of the Tymnet  MUX  is
                  its  ability  to  be  used  as  a realtime communications
                  device.


          II.  GENERAL INFORMATION

              1.  When usernames are "genned" into the MUX slot code,  both
                  LABELING and HEAR parameters should be specified.

              2.  A sufficient number of names should be "genned" into  the
                  MUX code and validated on the network for the MUX host so
                  that all network operators have access to the MUX.

              3.  In the following procedures the form (ESC) represents the
                  depression of the ESCAPE key.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              A.  Using the MUX for Multiple Host and/or Utility Logins:

                  1.  Log into the MUX

                  2.  At the MUX prompt, type: M xxxxxxxx

                             (where xxxxxxxx = a label you  would  like  to
                              assign to the port being used for the circuit
                              that is about to be built)

                  3.  At the "PLEASE LOG IN" prompt,  you  proceed  with  a
                      normal login process appropriate for the desired host
                      or utility.

                  4.  To return to the MUX command level, type: (ESC)Z

                                                    PAGE  24
MUX


                  5.  If you wish to build another circuit, go  to  STEP  2
                      again.  

                  6.  To transfer from a terminal circuit and return to the
                      MUX command level, you simply type: (ESC)Z .

                  7.  To transfer from the MUX command level to an existing
                      circuit,  simply  type:  S xxxxxxx (xxxxxxx = circuit
                      label, see STEP 2).

                  8.  To backpressure a circuit, you must have the terminal
                      currently  connected to the circuit and there must be
                      at least one other circuit built.

                      a.  Then simply type (ESC)B and the circuit to  which
                          your  terminal is connected will be backpressured
                          and your terminal will transferred  to  the  next
                          circuit.

                      b.  To release backpressure, you need  only  transfer
                          back   into  the  backpressured  port  by  either
                          transferring to that port from  the  MUX  command
                          level  or  by  transferring  to  it  from another
                          circuit by typing (ESC)B or (ESC)G .

                  9.  If circuits are not backpressured,  any  output  from
                      those  ports  will  be  labeled  and displayed on the
                      terminal.  It is possible to display the output of  a
                      running  logger,  for instance, while also displaying
                      the output of a code loading facility such as  LOADII
                      or  ELF.  You can, therefore, watch the load proceed,
                      know when  the  load  ends  and  observe  the  logger
                      indications  of  the  node  and/or  slot's  return to
                      service.

              B.   Using  the  MUX  for   Direct   Terminal   to   Terminal
                  Communications

                  1.   If  a  network  is  spread  out  around  the  world,
                      communications   costs  between  related  to  network
                      operations can be reduced by utilizing the MUX's TALK
                      and HEAR capabilities.

                  2.  If you have need to communicate with  someone,  type:
                      WHO at the MUX's command level.

                  3.  If the user you want is logged in :

                      a.  At the MUX command level prompt, type: HEAR Y

                      b.  Again at the MUX command level prompt, type: TALK
                          xxxxxxx

                                                    PAGE  25
MUX


                             (where  xxxxxxx  =   user   name   with   whom
                              communications must be established)

                      c.  Everything you type will now  be  transferred  to
                          the  desired  user  as soon as you terminate your
                          input with a carriage return.

                      d.  As soon as he performs STEP B.3.a and STEP B.3.b,
                          whatever  he  types  will  be transferred to your
                          terminal as soon as he types a carrriage return.

                      e.  To terminate the session, (ESC)Z should be  typed
                          and the talk feature will be diabled and you will
                          be returned to the MUX command level.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                              ISIS: MEMORY ALLOCATIONS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure describes the process for determining  the
                  memory  allocations  made to the various slots in an ISIS
                  node.  This procedure is applicable  to  those  instances
                  where  dumps  of  the code from lowest memory through the
                  entirety  of  some  specific  slot  is   required.    For
                  instance,  dumps  are  often  required  starting with low
                  memory and including the entirety of SLOT 0.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

              1.  Access to the BND file for the node on which  the  memory
                  allocations are to be determined.

              2.  Access to the utility program MERLIN.


          III.  PROCEDURE 

              1.  Log into a system where MERLIN and the  node's  BND  file
                  are accessible or can be made accessible.

              2.  At the executive prompt, type: R MERLIN

              3.  At MERLIN's prompt, type: RUN

              4.  In response to MERLIN's "ENTER KERNEL FILE NAME"  prompt,
                  type the file name for the BND file.

              5.  In response to MERLIN's "SLOT x PRESENT OPTION:"  or  the
                  "SLOT xx NOT PRESENT OPTION" prompts, type: /N

              6.  Repeat STEP 5 until the prompts cease and the SLOT MAP is
                  printed.  The SLOT MAP will have the form:

                                      SLOT MAP

                  SLOT BEGINS ENDS
                   0   15400  62C00  <----As an example, to dump the entire

MEMORY ALLOCATION


                   1   66100  714FF       node from Loc 0 through all of   
                       
                   2   71500  794FF       Slot O, addresses through        
                                 
                   3   79500  860FF       62C00 would have to be dumped.   
                                

              7.  MERLIN will then return to the system's executive prompt.


               COMMENT:

                  This process is useful for determining in  memory  errors
                  at  some  specific  locations  fall within a slot that is
                  experiencing distress.

                            TMCS: FUNCTIONING IN DISPLAY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure will outline the proper method of  setting
                  up TMCS to function in the DISPLAY more.


          II.  PROCEDURE 

              1.  Log into TMCS

              2.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS PRO

              3.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS SEL

              4.  Check the output from STEP 3 and use the  TMCS  "RESTORE"
                  and/or  "IGNORE"  commands  to establish the LIMITS which
                  will be required to obtain the DISPLAY coverage  that  is
                  required.

                  NOTE: It will be impossible to restore anything which  is
                         not  listed  in  the  output from STEP 2.  Consult
                         TMCS documentation for procedure  for  having  the
                         PROFILE changed.

              5.  Locate the terminal identifier just to the right  of  the
                  TMCS  user  name in the first line of the output obtained
                  in STEP 2.

              6.  If your terminal is not comparable to the  terminal  type
                  identified  in  STEP 5, use the TMCS "TER" command to set
                  TMCS up for your specific terminal.

                  Type: TER ? in response to the TMCS prompt  to  obtain  a
                        list of acceptable terminal types.

                  Type: TER xxxxxxx in response to the TMCS prompt  to  set
                        TMCS  up  for  the  terminal  now  in  use.  (where

                            XRAY: LINK/LINE PERFORMANCE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The purpose of this procedure is to define the methods by
                  which  information  relative to a link/line's performance
                  can be obtained with the utility XRAY.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access to XRAY in the target node
                  2. Access to XRAY documentation


          III.  PROCEDURE

                        1. LINK STATUS
                        2. WINDOW SIZE
                        3. NUMBER of CIRCUITS
                        4. LINK and LINE TYPES
                        5. SPEED
                        6. TIME LINK ATTACHED/DETACHED

                  1.  Log into XRAY in one of  the  nodes  into  which  the
                      target LINK/LINE terminates.

                  2.  In response to the XRAY prompt, type: ND

                  3.  The above information will be printed out in response
                      to the "ND" command.

                      NOTE: The ERRATE is an indication of the  error  rate
                            which  exists  on  the  line.   The  best  line
                            condition is  represented  by  no  entry  under
                            ERRATE  for that line.  The worst error rate is
                            represented by ****.  A single "star" (*) would
                            indicate a line is degrading, a double ** would
                            indicate  a  poor  line,  a  triple  ***  would
                            indicate  a  bad  line,  and  four  ****  would
                            indicate a very bad line.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                             NODE FAILURE AND RECOVERY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This   procedure    describes    the    techniques    for
                  trouble-shooting a failure of a node and its recovery.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. knowledge of TYM files.
                  2. Ability to use XRAY.
                  3. Access to loading facility, LOADII or ELF.
                  4. Access to the NODE CODE for the node that is down.
                  5. Access to PROBE.
                  6. Access to NAD (not essential).


          III.  PROCEDURES

              1.  Verify that the node that is down is not DEADENDED  (only
                  1  connection  to  the  network).   This  can  be done by
                  checking the TYM file for the node that is down  (Network
                  Configuration section).

              2.  If the node is deadended, check its only neighbor using a
                  probe snap to verify that the neighbor is up.

              3.  If the neighbor node is down, it must first  be  returned
                  to  the  network  before  the  original node can come up.
                  Should the neighbor be down go back to STEP 1 and proceed
                  until  there  is  a  node  that  is  up  to  be used as a
                  neighbor, then proceed.

              4.  Check the TYM file of the neighbor to get its KERNEL HOST
                  number.

              5.  Log into the neighbor node with XRAY and get the  LINE   
                  that goes to the node that is down.

             5a.  Enter CL 10 for indication  of  line  problems  prior  to
                  leaving the network.

NODE FAILURE


              6.  Try a CRASH DUMP using LOADII.

              7.  If a crash table address is received (valid or not),  the
                  crash  dump  has  been received and is completed when the
                  "EXIT" is displayed.  Go to STEP 12.

              8.  If a crash table is not received, the crash dump must  be
                  attempted from another neighbor and LINE   (get this info
                  using STEP 4).

              9.  If still no success, the  node  may  have  to  be  booted
                  manually,  or  the  lines  on  the  target machine is not
                  raising "RS".

             10.  Contact the site and request them to boot the  node.   To
                  boot  a full Engine or MiniEngine, have the site open the
                  front door of the node and on the fourth board down there
                  is  a  silver toggle switch on the right side.  They must
                  push this switch all the way up and release  it.   If  it
                  was  in the snapped down position originally, they should
                  put it back that way.  To boot a MicroEngine,  have  them
                  press   in   the   "BOOT"  button  on  the  back  of  the
                  MicroEngine.

             11.  If there is no one on site to boot the node, the hardware
                  support agency should be contacted to check out the node.

             12.  Once the node is booted, repeat STEPs 5 and 6.

             13.  Reload the node with the production code, using the  same
                  neighbor and LINE   that was used in STEP 5.

             14.  If the node does not return to the network, try the  load
                  again.   If  the node still does not come up, contact the
                  support agency.

             15.  Verify node is back up with PROBE snap.

             16.  Verify all lines to node are back up by logging into node
                  with XRAY.

             17.  Analysis of crash dump can be performed using NAD and the
                  ENGDMP  command  file.   If  there is no access to NAD or
                  ENGDMP, turn the crash dump over to the support agency.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                              FORCE NODE TO BOOTSTRAP



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure describes various ways  in  which  a  node
                  running  on  the  network can be forced to go to its BOOT
                  for DOWNLINE access by LOADII or ELF.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  Access to the node directly or through a third party.
                  2.  Access to XRAY (with privileged status) in the target
                      node.
                  3.  Access to DDT (with  license  L.SYA)  in  the  target
                      node.
                  4.  Access to PROBE with Status "10".


          III.  PROCEDURES

              I.  To  send  Engine  or  MiniEngine  to  its  DOWNLINE  BOOT
                  manually:

                  1.  Open the front door of the engine.

                  2.  Locate the toggle-switch on the  right  side  of  the
                      Multi-Function card.  (The MF card is the fourth card
                      down from the top of the card cage.)

                  3.  Lift the Multi-Function  card  toggle-switch  against
                      the  internal  spring  loading  until it is fully up.
                      Then move the switch to the full down position.

                  4.  The left most digit  displayed  on  the  front  panel
                      should begin to sequence from 0 through F repeatedly.
                      The right side of the front panel  will  display  the
                      version  of  the  boot resident in the Multi-Function
                      card.

                      NOTE: A MiniEngine will not necessarily  be  equipped
                             with a front panel.

BOOT NODE


                  5.  Close the front door of the machine.

              II.  To send a MicroEngine to its DOWNLINE BOOT manually:

                  1.  Locate the Boot Switch on the rear  of  the  machine.
                      The switch will be a protected pushbutton and will be
                      marked "BOOT".

                  2.  Depress the Boot Switch and release it.

                  3.  The "RUN" indicator on  the  front  panel  should  be
                      illuminated.

                  4.  The machine will now be running in its DOWNLINE BOOT.

             III.  To Boot  an  Asynchronous  Terminal  Concentrator  (ATC)
                  manually:

                  1.  The ATC boot  brings  the  entire  node's  code  into
                      memory  from  the node's internal PROMs.  (Booting an
                      ATC does not load a DOWNLINE BOOTSTRAP.)

                  2.  To Boot the code into  the  ATC's  memory,  turn  the
                      power  switch OFF, wait for ten seconds and then turn
                      the power switch ON.

                  3.  The machine will then initialize  and  begin  to  run
                      it's code.

              IV.  To force a Micro, Mini or Engine to it Boot via PROBE:

                   NOTE: For this procedure to work the machine must be  on
                         the  network.   Also, be aware that this procedure
                         is the preferred method of forcing a node  to  its
                         Boot through the network.

                  1.  Log into PROBE in the active supervisor.

                  2.  At the PROBE prompt, type: DLOAD xxxx (where xxxx  is
                      the  number  of  the  node you wish to have go to its
                      Bootstrap).

                  3.  If the command fails to send the node to its Boot, it
                      is probably because:

                      a.  The MiniEngine  or  Engine  Boot  switch  on  the
                          Multi-Function  card  is  disabled,  ie.  in it's
                          center rather than down position.
                      b.  The MicroEngine has been internally  optioned  to
                          prevent  DLOAD  commands from forcing the machine
                          to it's Boot.
                      c.  Attempt Procedures V.  and VI.  if this procedure
                          fails.

BOOT NODE


              V.  To force a Micro, Mini or Engine to BOOT via XRAY:

                  NOTE: For this procedure to work the machine must  be  on
                         the network.

                  1.  Log into XRAY in the target node.

                  2.  Set privileged status in XRAY.

                  3.  Type: BT in response to the XRAY prompt.

                  4.  Attempt Procedures IV.  and VI.   if  this  procedure
                      fails.

              VI.  To force an ISIS Micro, Mini or Engine to  it  Boot  via
                  DDT:

                  NOTE: For this procedure to work the machine must  be  on
                         the  network and the copy of the bootstrap left in
                         memory from the last  booting  operation  MUST  be
                         intact.

                  1.  Log into DDT in the target machine.

                  2.  In response to the SLOT? prompt, type: !

                  3.  At the next DDT prompt, type: ?SLOT .

                  4.  If the slot is identified as FF  proceed.   Otherwise
                      get into Slot FF.

                  5.  In response to the DDT prompt, type: G 5A

                  6.  In a few seconds the machine will leave  the  network
                      and your DDT circuit will drop.

                  7.  If you cannot access the machine then through  LOADII
                      or  ELF, you will have to assume that the copy of the
                      Boot resident in memory was corrupted  and  you  will
                      have to have the machine MANUALLY booted.


               COMMENTS:

                  Putting a machine into its boot will interrupt all of the
                  service being provided by the machine.  It should also be
                  remembered that preferred sequence of  methods  attempted
                  to force a machine to its boot is:

                         1. PROBE's "DLOAD" command.
                         2. XRAY's "BT" command.
                         3. DDT's "Go location" command.

                                  HEALTH OF A NODE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure outlines methods of obtaining  information
                  relative  to a node's general health without interrupting
                  users of that node.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. XRAY access to the target node.
                  2. Access to an unused slot within ISIS nodes.
                  3. Access to LOADII or ELF IF the target node is an ISIS
                       machine.
                  4. Access to the file: SLCRSH.NIB if the target is an
                       ISIS node.


          III.  PROCEDURES

              I.  To determine fundamental condition of the node:

                  1.  Log into XRAY in the target node.

                  2.  In response to the XRAY prompt type: ND

                  3.  Observe the XRAY output and note the following:

                      a.  Elapsed time since "NODE FIRST CAME UP"

                             (This is time since node was last loaded  with
                              code.)

                      b.  Elapsed time since "NODE LAST CAME UP"

                             (This is time since node last recovered from a
                              crash.)

                      c.  The crash COUNT, TYPE and ADDRESS.

                      d.  The STATUS of the lines.

NODE HEALTH


                      e.  The ERRATE of the lines.

                      f.   The  TIILNK  NEIGHBORS  DOWN  list.   These  are
                          neighbors  which  were specified for this node in
                          its TYM file but which have not communicated with
                          the  target  node  since  it was last loaded with
                          code.

                  4.  At the XRAY prompt type: CL xx .

                      A.  THE QUALITY XX WILL BE THE  NUMBER  OF  THE  MOST
                          RECENT  CRYPTO  LOGGER messages you wish to view.
                          (XRAY expects xx to be entered in HEX.  A maximum
                          of  256 (DECIMAL), ie.  FF (HEX), messages can be
                          displayed.)

                      b.   Observe  the  XRAY  crypto  logger  output   for
                          indications  of kernel overloads, line anomalies,
                          slot reports, etc.

                  5.  Again at the XRAY prompt type: NS

                      a.  Observe the EXCT (Executive  Loop  Count)  value.
                          It should be greater than 40 on a properly loaded
                          node.

                      b.   Observe  the  EXLW  value.   (This   is   lowest
                          Executive   Loop   Count   which   the  node  has
                          experienced since the values were last reset.)

                      c.  Observe the EXWH value.  (This  is  the  greatest
                          Executive   Loop  Count  which  the  machine  has
                          experienced since the values were last reset.)

                          NOTE: The EXCT, EXLW and EXWH counts can be reset
                                 by  typing:  NS  Z IN response to the XRAY
                                 prompt.   This  will  allow  the  user  to
                                 observe   Executive  Loop  Count  behavior
                                 during specific time frames

                      d.  Observe the TOTAL value for CODE DELAY and H-WARE
                          DELAY.  The value should be less than 50.

                  6.  At the XRAY prompt type: KS xxxx (where  xxxx  =  the
                      node number of a neighbor).

                      a.  Observe the PACKET OVERHEAD values  but  remember
                          that  overhead  is inversely proportional to data
                          traffic.  The overhead remains roughly fixed  and
                          if   there   is  little  data  on  the  line  the
                          percentage of overhead will be driven up.

NODE HEALTH


                      b.  Observe the BANDWIDTH utilization.  It should  be
                          less than 60% and not greater than 70%.

                      c.  Observe the TOTAL for LINK DELAY.  It  should  be
                          less than 50 ms.

                      d.  Observe the OVERLOAD COUNT.  This is  the  number
                          of  times the RMAKE routine could not service all
                          channels with data within 500 ms.  A threshold of
                          10/min exists for this measurement.

                      e.  Observe the SATURATION COUNT.  This indicated the
                          number of times the link was never idle for a 1/2
                          second period.  A threshold of 30/min exists  for
                          this measurement.

                      f.  Observe the BACKLOG COUNT.  This is the number of
                          times  the  RMAKE routine could not make a packet
                          due to closed window.

                              NOTE:  The KS command should be exercised on
                                      every active neighbor.

              II.  To obtain CRASH TABLE information from  a  running  ISIS
                  node:

                  1.  Using LOADII or ELF load SLCRSH.NIB  into  an  unused
                      slot in the target node.

                  2.  Log into DDT in the target node.

                  3.  Enter the slot just loaded with SLCRSH.NIB.

                  4.  Run SLCRSH by typing ?STAT at the DDT prompt.

                  5.  SLCRSH will return information relative to the  node,
                      the  node  type, version of code, crash count and the
                      time the node was last taken over by the  supervisor.
                      It  will  also  display  the SUMMARY CRASH TABLE, the
                      DETAIL CRASH TABLES, REGISTER SET 0 and  F  contents,
                      MAC Status and Segmentation Register contents.


               COMMENTS:

                  With reasonable care being used while working in DDT, the
                  procedures outlined above will not be disruptive to users
                  of the node.

                               CLEARING PORTS IN TMCS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  To free a port in TMCS to allow access to it.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Must be logged into TMCS.
                  2. Must have "HANG" license in TMCS.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  At the asterick prompt (*) type "WHO".   This  will  list
                  the  ports in TMCS and the one with the * next to it will
                  be the one that the user is currently in on.

              2.  At the next * prompt type "HANG XX", with "XX" being  the
                  port number that is to be cleared.

              3.  At the next * prompt type "WHO" again.  This  will  again
                  list  the ports and then it can be verified that the port
                  is cleared by it being missing  from  the  list  of  port
                  numbers.


               COMMENTS:

                  You may clear all users except yourself by  typing  "HANG
                  ALL" and a carriage return.

                                HEALTH OF ISIS SLOT



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure will  outline  some  of  the  more  common
                  methods  which  can  be utilized to ascertain the general
                  health of an ISIS slot.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. DDT access to the node containing the target slot.
                  2. XRAY access to the node containing the target slot.
                  3. Access to a loading facility, LOADII or ELF.
                  4. Access to the program CRASH.


          III.  PROCEDURES

              I.  To determine if the target slot is RUNNING:

                  1.  Log into DDT in the target node.

                  2.  Enter the target slot.

                          (If the slot is  halted,  you  should  receive  a
                           "SLOT   HALTED"   message.    However,   further
                           verification of slot operation according to  the
                           following steps is recommended.)

                  3.  At the DDT prompt type: ?CPU

                  4.  Observe the response.  If the  quantities  for  "RATE
                      USER"  and  "RATE  SYSTEM" are greater than zero (0),
                      the slot is running.

                  5.  Further verification that the slot is running can  be
                      obtained by typing: ?HISTORY .

                  6.  Observe  the  "Comments"  column.   If  the  slot  is
                      running  the  most recent history for the target slot
                      will indicate "STARTED" and then "RESTARTED".

ISIS SLOT HEALTH


              II.  To determine the date and time the slot was last HALTED:

                  1.  Log into DDT in the target node.

                  2.  Enter the target slot.

                  3.  In response to the DDT prompt, type: ?HISTORY .

                  4.  Observe the "Comment" column.   "HALTED  BY  COMMAND"
                      indicates  that  the  slot  was  manually halted with
                      DDT's "H" command.  "HALTED" indicates that the  slot
                      crashed.

                  5.  Observe the right most column  for  the  most  recent
                      indication  that  the slot was HALTED.  The left most
                      column will indicate the time lapse  since  the  slot
                      halt.   The  elapsed  time will be displayed in days,
                      hours, minutes and seconds or if the elapsed time was
                      less  than  one  day  the  time  will be displayed in
                      hours, minutes and seconds.

                  6.  The date and time of the most  recent  slot  stoppage
                      can  then  be  calculated  using the current date and
                      time and the elapsed time.


              III.  To recover a slot's CRASH TABLE:

                  1.  Run the program CRASH.

                  2.  If you have to pass through a gateway  to  reach  the
                      target  node,  type  a  "G" in response to the "ENTER
                      KERNEL HOST NUMBER" prompt.

                  3.  Respond to the remaining CRASH  program  prompts  and
                      CRASH  will  print  out  the  slot's  host  info, the
                      versions of code in the ISIS  kernel  and  the  slot,
                      identification  of  the slot type, information on the
                      last crash and finally the slot's crash table.


               COMMENTS:

                  If the user exercises sufficient care while in DDT,  none
                  of  the  procedures specified above will be disruptive to
                  users of the target node.

          I.  PURPOSE

                  This   procedure    describes    the    techniques    for
                  trouble-shooting  an inter-nodal OCL line which is either
                  out of service or providing degraded service.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access to the LINST.REL test file.
                  2. Access to a code loading utility, LOADII or ELF.
                  3. Ability to have breakout box loopbacks set up.
                  4. Knowledge of which physical node ports connect to the
                      line.
                  5. Access to PROBE, XRAY and/or TMCS.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  (Diagram A will be referenced in the following steps.)

           ............                                      ............ 
           :          :                                      :          :
           :  NODE A  :______________________________________:  NODE B  :
           :          :\                                   /:          :
           :..........: \__Port x               Port y__/ :..........:

                                     Diagram A


              1.  Using PROBE place a  SHUT  in  the  line  and  when  XRAY
                  indicates the number of users on the line is sufficiently
                  low, proceed to STEP 2.

              2.  Jumper Pin 4 to Pin 11 on a breakout box.

              3.  Remove the cable from Port x of Node A.

              4.  Install the breakout box on Port x but do not connect the
                  cable to the breakout box.

              5.  Using LOADII or ELF, attempt to load  LINTST.REL  through
                  Port  x  of  NODE  A.   (The breakout box will act as the
                  target for the load)

              6.  If the terminal logged into the load utility  (LOADII  or
                  ELF)  displays  any  indications  of "Lost Data", you are
                  receiving an indication of errors and NODE A will require
                  servicing.   After  servicing  has  been completed, go to
                  STEP 14.

              7.  If LINTST.REL loads without loosing data, disconnect  the
                  breakout  box from Port x and connect the breakout box to
                  the cable end which was initially disconnected from  Port
                  x.

              8.  Terminate any "loading" of LINTST.REL currently  underway
                  through  NODE  A  and  attempt to do a load of LINTST.REL
                  through Port y of NODE B.

              9.  If the load utility being used does not indicate any lost
                  data, go to STEP 11.

             10.  If no data is being "lost", remove the breakout box  from
                  the cable, disconnect the cable from Port y of NODE B and
                  connect the breakout box to Port y of NODE  A.   (Do  not
                  connect the cable to the breakout box.)

             11.  Stop and restart the load of LINTST.REL through Port y of
                  NODE  B.   If  data  is  still  lost, NODE B will require
                  servicing.  If data is not lost, either the cable is  bad
                  or the drivers and/or receivers in Port y are not able to
                  support the cable load.  In either event  servicing  will
                  be  required.   After  the  servicing is completed, go to
                  STEP 14.

             12.  Make certain that the cable is reconnected to Port  x  of
                  NODE A and disconnected from Port y of NODE B.

             13.  Connect the breakout box to the cable  end  removed  from
                  Port y but do not connect the breakout box to Port y.

             14.  Terminate any loads which are in progress and restart the
                  loading  of LINTST.REL through Port x of NODE A.  If data
                  is lost during the load, you may  be  observing  a  cable
                  program  but  you  are probably observing an inability of
                  NODE A to properly drive the cable load.

             15.  After servicing is complete, rerun any tests which failed
                  to verify the effectiveness of the service effort.

             16.  Reconnect the inter-nodal line to the appropriate ports.

             17.  Terminate any loads which are underway.

             18.  Observe the line with PROBE, XRAY or TMCS for any further
                  indications of problems.


               COMMENTS:

                  The   procedure   used   here    to    trouble-shoot    a
                  Memory-Shuffler  line  will not cause any interruption of
                  service on the remainder of either node.

          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure describes the process for trouble-shooting
                  a suspected failure in asynchronous ports which have been
                  assigned to an ISIS slot.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. A working knowledge of the interpretation of TYM
                   files.
                  2. An ability to use DDT.
                  3. Access to SLASYN.NIB.
                  4. Means of loading SLASYN.NIB.
                  5. Ability to run and interpret SLASYN.NIB.
                  6. Means of providing loopbacks on AYSNC ports.


          III.  PROCEDURES

              1.  Disconnect  the  modem(s),  terminal  device(s)  or  host
                  port(s) from the suspected Engine ASYNC ports.

              2.  Loopback the  suspected  port(s)  in  one  of  the  three
                  following ways:

                  a.  By removing the ASYNC RIBBON CABLE(S) from  the  edge
                      of  the  ASYNC  Board  and  installing  TYMNET  ASYNC
                      LOOP-BACK PLUGS (P/N AST6-1) in place of  the  ribbon
                      cable(s).

                      NOTE: The ribbon cable connector on the edge  of  the
                             ASYNC board service the ports indicated below:

                                  CONNECTOR              PORTS

                                     X6             12 - 15
                                     X7             16 - 19
                                     X8             20 - 23

                                     X10            28 - 31

                      NOTE: The TYM files and the  physical  addressing  of
                             ASYNC  Board  can  be  used  to  determine the
                             correct AYSNC board to jumper.

                             The ribbon cables from the connector panel  to
                             the   AYSNC   Board  can  also  be  traced  to
                             determine the correct board to be jumpered.

                  b.   By  installing  TYMNET  loop-back   plugs   on   the
                      appropriate  Engine  connector-panel jacks.  (Use P/N
                      AST7-1 for 37pin connectors, P/N 630030-001 for 25pin
                      connectors)

                  c.  By installing a breakout box on a specific port  with
                      RD looped back to TD, DSR looped back to DTR and with
                      RTS looped back to DCD.

              3.  Load SLASYN.NIB into the appropriate slot.

              4.  Log into DDT in  the  target  machine,  transfer  to  the
                  appropriate   slot   and   gain   access  to  the  SLASYN
                  diagnostic.

              5.   Establish  the  parameters  for  SLASYN  which   closely
                  approximate  the  conditions  on  the  port  when  it  is
                  failing.  Signal  toggling  should  normally  be  enabled
                  during testing.

              6.  Reset and Start the diagnostic then display  the  results
                  periodically to observe the testing process.

              7.  If the  test  fails,  the  appropriate  hardware  support
                  agency  should  be  called upon for assistance.  When the
                  problem  is  reported  cleared  verify  that  the  SLASYN
                  diagnostic runs by repeating STEPS 3 though 6.

              8.  Insure that the proper production is loaded into the slot
                  and verify with DDT that the slot is running.

              9.  Make certain that  all  loopbacks  are  removed  and  the
                  cables are connected.

             10.  Verify with the person reporting the problem that service
                  has, in actual fact, been restored.

               COMMENTS:

                  When the diagnostic SLASYN.NIB is loaded into a slot, all
                  production  service  in  that  slot  will be interrupted.
                  However, service in other slots within the target machine
                  will not be affected.

                          SYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATIONS LINE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This    procedure    describes    the    technique    for
                  trouble-shooting  a  suspected  failure  of a synchronous
                  communications line which is assigned to an ISIS slot.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. A knowledge of TYM files.
                  2. An ability to use DDT.
                  3. Access to SLSYNC.NIB or SLSIO.NIB 
                  4. Means of loading SLSYNC.NIB or SLSIO.NIB
                  5. Ability to run SLSYNC.NIB or SLSIO.NIB
                  6. Direct or indirect means of looping back modems.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Run a loopback test  between  the  modems  on  the  line.
                  (Return  modems  to  normal  configuration  after test is
                  completed)

              2.  If the loopback test  fails,  run  a  self  test  on  the
                  modems.   (Return  modems  to  normal configuration after
                  test is completed)

              3.  If the self tests fail, turn  the  problem  over  to  the
                  agency  responsible for the maintenance of the modems and
                  go to STEP 18.

              4.  If the self test passes, turn the  problem  over  to  the
                  appropriate  telephone  service  group and have loopbacks
                  run to the CIU's at both ends of the line.

              5.  If the loopbacks fail,  turn  the  problem  over  to  the
                  telephone service group for resolution and go to STEP 18.

              6.  Using the Node and  Slot  TYM  files  or  using  the  ?LU
                  command  in  DDT, determine if the suspect line is driven
                  by SYNC Brd or by SIO Brd hardware.

                                                    PAGE  51
SYNC LINE


              7.  If more than one logical unit is assigned  to  the  slot,
                  use  the  Node TYM files, Slot TYM files and notes on the
                  configuration of the network to determine  which  logical
                  unit is suspect.

              8.   If  the  line  is  supported  by  SYNC  hardware,   load
                  SLSYNC.NIB into the slot.

              9.  If the line is supported by SIO hardware, load  SLSIO.NIB
                  into the slot.

             10.  Log into the slot diagnostic just loaded and  assign  the
                  suspect logical unit to the diagnostic.

             11.  Place the modem cabled to the  suspect  logical  unit  in
                  analog (line) loopback.

             12.  Start the slot diagnostic and  periodically  display  the
                  test results.

             13.  If the slot diagnostic fails, turn the  problem  over  to
                  the  appropriate  hardware  support agency and go to STEP
                  18.

             14.  If the slot diagnostic runs without error, have the modem
                  taken  out  of loopback and have the distant modem placed
                  in digital loopback.

             15.  Stop, Reset and Restart the slot diagnostic.

             16.  If the diagnostic now fails, you have either a  modem  or
                  line  problem not detected in previous testing.  Have the
                  problem cleared by the appropriate support agency and  go
                  to STEP XX.

             17.  If the diagnostic does not fail in STEP 16, the node  and
                  slot  code  should be considered suspect and the terminal
                  or host device at the end of the line should  be  checked
                  for malfunction.

             18.  Insure that the production code is loaded into  the  slot
                  and  that  the  production  code  is running.  Use DDT to
                  verify this.

             19.  Insure that loopbacks are removed from all modems.

             20.  After the problem is found and thought to  be  corrected,
                  verify with the person reporting the problem that service
                  has been restored.

                  When SLSYNC.NIB or SLSIO.NIB is loaded into  a  slot  all
                  production service in that slot is interrupted.  However,
                  there is no interruption to the service provided by other
                  slots within the machine.

          I.  PURPOSE

                  To define the criteria of access controls  to  the  PROBE
                  job slot.


          II.  SCOPE

                  Access to `PROBE' commands  is  delegated  at  validation
                  time.   Each  user name is assigned an OCTAL value.  Each
                  bit  in  this  OCTAL  value  represents  a  character  of
                  privilege.   The  maximum  value  is  77 octal.  The bits
                  break down is as follows:

                       Cannot be hung      100 000
                       STATUS 20 commands  010 000
                       STATUS 10 commands  001 000
                       *No Timeout set     000 100
                       STATUS 2 commands   000 010
                       STATUS 1 commands   000 001

                  Classes of user access may be set up as follows:

                       Look do not touch    status  00/04
                       Specific statistics  status  20/24
                       Change topology      status  30/34
                       Control supervisor   status  31/35
                       Initialize& Control status  33/37

                * If a user's connect time to PROBE is to be checked,  turn
                  bit  4 of the low order off.  This will automatically log
                  the user off after an assembled in time frame.

                  There are two groups of user names in PROBE.   The  first
                  and  most  important  is the assembled in group.  This is
                  one or more names, password and status which is  compiled
                  into  the  PROBE software at system generation time.  YOU
                  MUST HAVE ONE ASSEMBLED IN PROBE NAME.  The second  group
                  is  Disk  resident names, passwords and status level.  To
                  bring  a  supervisor  up  from  scratch,  you  need   the
                  assembled  in  name  to  enter  at  least your first Disk

PROBE ACCESS OPERATIONS


                  resident name.  Any Disk resident name of 35  or  37  may
                  enter probe names on disk.

                  Having access to an assembled in user name for day to day
                  operation  is important.  This is to the possibility of a
                  disk failure barring any Disk resident name from  logging
                  in.   If this occurs, the only control of supervisor will
                  be through the power off switch.   PROBE  has  a  maximum
                  limit  on simultaneous users.  One slot is always held in
                  reserve for  an  assembled  in  user,  thus  guaranteeing
                  access to your Network Control personnel.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Use the `list' command to determine a free disk slot.

              2.  Type "ENTER [Job slot] [user name]  [STATUS  level]"  The
                  slot number should be used in each supervisor.

                     Example: ENTER 127 NETWORK1 37 - will give  access  to
                              the  user  name NETWORK1 with a status of 37.
                              The password will be a defaulted value.   See
                              your network administrator for the password.

              3.  To delete a user name, use the list command to  find  the
                  slot number.  Type "ENTER [slot number]"

                     Example: ENTER 127 - This will delete the name created
                              in step 2 above.

              4.   The  list  command  will  list  all  probe  names.   All
                  assembled  in  names will be preceded by "AAA".  All Disk
                  names will be preceded by a number 0 through your  system
                  generation  maiximum.   Any name having an asteric by the
                  slot number has a default password.  The owner or user of
                  that  PROBE  name should be reminded to change it or have
                  the name removed.

              5.  For assembled in names, the `PSWD' should be used to find
                  a  hexhex cipher for a user name and password.  These two
                  values should  be  given  to  the  system  programmer  to
                  generate  into PROBE.  This is the only method of adding,
                  deleting or changing the default password of this name.

              6.  Any PROBE user name may change  the  password  using  the
                  `Password' command.

                              PERFORMANCE OF LINK/LINE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The purpose of this procedure is to define the methods by
                  which  information  relative to a link/line's performance
                  can be recovered with the utility PROBE.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access to PROBE in the Active Supervisor
                  2. Access to PROBE documentation for Reference


          III.  PROCEDURE

              A.  Obtaining LINE SPEED and STATUS

                  1.  Log into PROBE  in  the  active  supervisor  for  the
                      network containing THE LINES WHICH ARE TO BE CHECKED.

                  2.  To determine the current LINE SPEED and STATUS (Shut,
                      Out  Frozen)  can be obtained by using PROBE's "NODE"
                      command.

                          The  resulting  PROBE  output  will  contain  the
                          desired   information   under  the  heading  LINK
                          STATUS.

                          PLEASE NOTE: An OUT status indicates a link is in
                                       the  process  of  being  returned to
                                       service after outage.

                                       If a link  is  out  of  service  and
                                       attempts   are  not  being  made  to
                                       restore it to service, there will be
                                       no indication of the link under LINK
                                       STATUS.

                                       SHUT  indicates   that   a   network
                                       operator  has  taken the link out of
                                       service.

PROBE LINE PERFORMANCE


                                       FROZEN indicates that the  link  has
                                       been  detached  but has not yet been
                                       declared down.

              B.  Obtaining a LINK  LOGGER  REPORTS,  both  Historical  and
                  Realtime

                  1.  A HISTORY of link reports or the ability  to  MONITOR
                      link  reports  in  realtime  can be obtained with the
                      PROBE "RNODE" "LOG" commands.  The  resulting  output
                      will  contain  link  reports  for  all  links  on the
                      specified node.  It is not  possible  with  PROBE  to
                      restrict link reports down to a single link.  If TMCS
                      is available, it's ability to restrict to a  specific
                      link   would  make  it  a  more  logical  choice  for
                      obtaining this type of information.

                      EXAMPLE OF PROBE COMMAND SEQUENCE:

                           RNODE xxxx (where xxxx = one of  the  two  nodes
                                       attached to the target link)

                           LOG zzzzESX (where zzzz = the number of  minutes
                                       back  from the current time that you
                                       wish to back up the logger (ie.  LOG
                                       34ESX) or the date (julian) and time
                                       (GMT) from which you would  like  to
                                       begin   receiving  information  (ie.
                                       241:12:45))

              C.  Obtaining STATUS on all the Links Assigned to a Node

                  1.  In PROBE only the SYNPRT command displays the  status
                      of all of the LINKS assigned to the node.

                  2.  To  obtain  the  SYNPRT  command  output  respond  to
                      PROBE's prompt with the following sequence:

                           RLOG 1D0
                           SYNPRT xxxx (where xxxx = target node number)
                           LOG 1C

                  3.  The command output will be displayed on the terminal.
                      Even  information  relative  to  assigned  but UNUSED
                      links will be displayed.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                                NETWORK NODE OUTAGE



          I.  PURPOSE

               This procedure outlines actions to be taken in the
               event of a Network Node Outage.

          II.  DEFINITION

               NETWORK NODE OUTAGE:  A  network  node  outage  is
               defined as a node which is not accessable, nor can
               it be accounted for  by  the  network  Supervisor.
               This   may   result   from   a   hardware/software
               malfunction, or a  transmission  facility  company
               problem.

          III.  PROCEDURE

               In the event of a  public  network  node  failure,
               Network Control will follow the procedure below to
               restore service:

           A.  Wait for ten minutes to determine  if  the  outage
               will clear itself (ie.  power failure).

              1.  If the outage clears,  record  the  outage  per
                  existing documented procedures.  

              2.  If the problem does not clear, proceed  to  the
                  next step.

           B.  Site Evaluation: This step  involves  calling  the
               site of the nodal location for evaluation of Telco
               equipment,   machinery    environment,    customer
               equipment   and   nodal   hardware.   It  will  be
               necessary to call the site and locate someone that
               is  familiar  with  the  node  and  its associated
               equipment.

              1.  Determine if the customer has  taken  the  node
                  down  for  any  reason.   If  yes,  ask  to  be
                  notified when it is returned to service.  Leave
                  a  call  back  number and then OnTyme the field

NODE OUTAGE


                  engineering group.

              2.  Determine if there has  been  an  environmental
                  failure.  Environmental problems are defined as
                  a loss  of  power,  loss  of  air  conditioning
                  (A/C),  or  a  site  fire.   In the event of an
                  environmental failure, proceed as follows:

                  * Ask to be notified when the environment
                   returns to 
                    normal.

                  * Leave call-back information.

                  * Send OnTyme to the regional field engineering
                   personnel.

                  If the  environment  has  returned  to  normal,
                  continue the evaluation.

              3.  Have the customer perform a  visual  inspection
                  of  the  node.   Determine if the node is in an
                  operational  state.   If  it  is  not,   notify
                  Network   Field   Engineering  of  the  outage.
                  Specify the type of equipment involved.

              4.  Perform an evaluation of associated  equipment.
                  Have the customer visually inspect the modem or
                  DSU for an obvious malfunction.  Perform  tests
                  on  the  DSU  or modem as appropriate including
                  loopback test and self tests.

                  * If either of these test should fail, report
                   the problem
                    and results to appropriate Telco group or
                   modem vendor.

                  * Send an OnTyme to maintenance to advise of
                   status.

              5.  If all of the above items  prove  inconclusive,
                  then  the problem should be reported to Network
                  Field Engineering.

              6.  If it is not possible to contact the site do to
                  a ring-no-answer (R/NA), Netcon will attempt to
                  dump  and   reload   the   node   (notify   the
                  maintenance group via OnTyme).

              7.  During regular working hours, node outages will
                  be    reported   to   the   appropriate   field
                  engineering  region  via  telephone,  and  then
                  followed  up  with  and  OnTyme (an OnTyme will

                  also be sent  when  the  node  returns  to  the
                  Network).

                                  SECURITY BREACH



          I.  PURPOSE

                  To determine what data is being sent to the supervisor on
                  a  command  circuit  for a login that is being flagged as
                  garbage.


          II.  SCOPE

                  Many bad login attempts are caused by  poor  Async  data.
                  This  data  is  garbled by the communication equipment on
                  the engine.  This procedure helps determine which.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.   Log  into  XRAY  on  the  effected  node  with  a  super
                  privileged name.

              2.  Set license in XRAY.

              3.  Issue a "TD 20" command with a printer turned on.   ("20"
                  represents  the  sup  command port.  It will always be 20
                  and 21.)

              4.  Issue a "TA 20" command with the printer turned on.

              5.  Issue a second "TA 20" command.

              6.  Look at the data for login request and the username.   If
                  the name is readable, someone or program may be trying to
                  get in.

                  Many times the data will be garbage.   The  "TA"  command
                  displays  ASCII  characters  for  the bit patterns.  This
                  data may cause your terminal to do unpredictable things.

                  NOTE: The XRAY logic will not display passwords.  No  one
                         can  get  to  them.   This command does not pose a
                         security problem.

SECURITY BREACH


              7.  If you see garbage, halt and restart  the  node  or  slot
                  (whichever  is  applicable).   When  DTR is present on an
                  Async terminal port, the port is hung on startup.  If the
                  garbage  continues  immediately  after  the  start,  then
                  Tymnet hardware should be suspected.

              8.  If the problem does not reappear, then terminal equipment
                  is suspect.

          I.  PURPOSE

                  To  define  the   steps   necessary   for   the
                  Reconfiguring  of  NEM  and  provide  for error
                  recovery.


          II.  SCOPE

                  This procedure has been  quite  work  out  over
                  time.    If   followed,  it  will  ensure  Disk
                  recovery in the event of an error.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Rename the ND####.NI1 to BK####.NI1.   (Do  not
                  ever write over code.)

              2.  Rename the  ND####.N01  to  BK####.N01.   (This
                  never works the first time.)

              3.  Rename the ND####.BND to  BK####.BND.   (Always
                  do this in order!)

              4.  Rename the ND####.D01 to BK####.D01.  (Old disk
                  configuration)

              5.  Rename the ND####.A01 to ND####.D01.  (This  is
                  current configuration.)

              6.  Copy the ND####.D01 to ND####.A01.  (After  the
                  copy,  make changes to the new A01 file.  Leave
                  the D01 alone.)

              7.  Log into the TMCS host  and  type  the  command
                  [ARCH  STORE  0].  This will take a copy of all
                  the node names and host name and user  profiles
                  and  all  kinds  of related material that makes
                  TMCS work.  If there is a I/O error,  call  the
                  site  and ask them to check the tape drive.  If

TMCS RECONFIGURING


                  the drive is online have them ini the  node  or
                  hault and execute the slot.  The code sometimes
                  hangs up the tape drive.  By  initializing  the
                  node, the host sees the tape drive again.

                  A.  Before you make  changes  to  the  new  A01
                      file, you must run TMRE.  This program will
                      make a memory estimate for the  slot.   The
                      procedure  is "R(SOURCE)TMRE".  The program
                      will prompt the user for configuration.

                  B.  Create a NI1 file by running the ND    .CI1
                      file.   This  will take about 15 minutes at
                      non-peak time or 1.5 hours  at  peak  time.
                      Each  interface  takes about 26000 TRU'S so
                      you will need a username with  a  unlimited
                      budget.   Also  the  directory will need at
                      least 10,000 pages.  After each gen, delete
                      *.TMP files.  The Pascal compiler creates a
                      lot of TMP files.

                  C.  After generating  the  NI1  file  known  as
                      'TMDM',  the  file  needs to be loaded into
                      the slot.  There are 2 procedures, first is
                      for  a  1  MEG  machine.   The  second is a
                      procedure for a multi MEG machine.

                      1.  R LOADII;SLOT,KHOST,1,ND####.NI1

                      2.  R COM;ND####.LI1  (This  is  a  command
                          file for the code to be loaded into the
                          second MEG through DDT.  The file  does
                          all the work.)

                  D.  After the slot has been loaded  with  TMDM,
                      it  will  return  to the network.  When the
                      slot comes up, you will need to login right
                      away.   The slot will only let one user in.
                      After that point, the host will show up  no
                      ports.   If  a  TMCS  user beats you to the
                      host, you will need to  log  into  DDT  and
                      hault  and execute the slot.  Then login to
                      slot right after doing this process.   This
                      problem  comes  from  users  that  have PVC
                      ports.

                  E.  When you get into the TMCS host,  you  will
                      see  a heading refering to disk maintenance
                      program with some version number with a '*'
                      for a prompt.  At this point, TMCS is ready
                      for your next command.  Your first  command
                      is 'SEE BELOW'.

TMCS RECONFIGURING


                      1.  Type 'DISP CONFIG' (This  will  display
                          the   old  configuration  and  the  new
                          configuration.   Warning:   This   only
                          shows   the   configurations  that  you
                          referenced at the gen, not what  is  in
                          the machine.)

                      2.  Type 'RECONF' (At  this  time  TMDM  is
                          reconfiguring  the  300  Megabite disk.
                          On the display, if you did  right,  you
                          will  see  the  areas  that  are  being
                          relocated.  If you did this wrong,  you
                          will see [CONFIG ERRORS].  This is only
                          a  warning.   The  information  is  not
                          lost.  When you see this error it means
                          that your D01 file  is  wrong.   So  go
                          back  to  the  system you gen it on and
                          start over.  Keep  your  ckt  into  the
                          TMCS  host.   If  you  do  not, someone
                          could  log  into  the  host  and   type
                          [INIT].   The  INIT  command is used to
                          zero  out  the  disk.    This   deletes
                          everything  off  the  disk.   Like node
                          names and host name and  user  profiles
                          and  all the related material that make
                          TMCS work.  So if you  do  not  have  a
                          good  copy  on tape, start crying.  But
                          do not fear, you are not lost.   Get  a
                          ARCH STORE off another TMCS host in the
                          network.  When the ARCH STORE  is  done
                          have the tape sent to wherever you need
                          it.  Then have  the  tape  put  on  the
                          drive  load  TMDM if you need to.  Then
                          type [ARCH STORE 0].   This  will  dump
                          all  information  from  tape  to  disk.
                          This will take about 10 minutes.  After
                          a  "RESTORE" command, you must halt and
                          restart the slot.

                      3.  Commands needed for TMDM:

                          A.  DISP     CONFIG     -     (Displays
                              configuration old and new)

                          B.  RECONF - (Starts TMDM  to  relocate
                              areas on 300 MEG disk)

                      4.   Commands  needed  in  TMCS  for  error
                          recovery:
                          (TMCS username needs  oper  status  for

          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure describes the method  and  process  to  be
                  used  when  monitoring  accounting  blocks.  It will also
                  explain the process for monitoring the  accounting  block
                  support program (Collector).


          II.  DEFINITION

              A.  Accounting Blocks - This is a  space  on  a  Supervisor's
                  disk that stores accounting daytas.  The space is divided
                  into  4305  (variable)  accounting  records.    The   raw
                  information is stored in 1000 characters per block.  When
                  the blocks reach zero, the Supervisor starts writing over
                  old accounting information.

              B.  Collector - This  program  creates  a  duplicate  of  the
                  accounting  blocks, providing a backup file of the disk's
                  information.  If the maximum 65,345 (variable) accounting
                  records  are  filled,  causing  the  Supervisor  to start
                  writing over old information, the old information is  not
                  lost.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  The accounting blocks should  be  monitored  through  all
                  shifts.   This  is  accomplished  by  watching  the color
                  monitors and using PROBE's "ACCT" command.

                  When 50% of the total  available  accounting  blocks  are
                  left,  a  message  will  be  displayed  across  TMS color
                  monitors.  The latest  accounting  block  total  will  be
                  displayed until either the Supervisor is changed, or more
                  than 50% of the blocks become available.

                  A  message  of  50%  of  less  availability  signifies  a
                  Collector danger zone.  The Supervisor must be changed to
                  avoid having old information "written" over".

COLLECTOR


                  At the danger zone, and after  every  Supervisor  change,
                  the  Collector  program  should  be  checked  for  proper
                  operation.

                  Collector checks are implemented via the following steps:

                  1.  Log into System 74 (i.e.  NETCON;74;password).

                  2.   Set  system  license  (i.e.   0   All   -   carriage
                      return;NETCON-carriage return; password).

                  The following Collector features should be checked:

                  1.  Do a systat command (see  example).   Check  to  make
                      sure  that  PJ  is logged in.  This will be under the
                      job name "PAM".

                  2.  Check to make sure that Collector is logged into  the
                      active  Supervisor.   Check  to see if it is creating
                      files for the current date.  The  job  name  will  be
                      "CPN   ".

                  If either  PJ  or  Collector  are  not  logged  in,  call
                  Fremont.   The  System 74 operator will have instructions
                  for  manually  restarting  PJ.   They  are  outlined   as
                  follows:

                  1.  NetCon should instruct the system operator to log-off
                      the  job  running  under  username  PJ,  and shut the
                      system.

                  2.  The operator will log the job off and shut the system
                      by  typing  "SCHED  40000"  at  the  exec level.  The
                      operators have the license to do this.

                      After a few minutes, the  operator  will  unshut  the
                      system.   On  System 74, the operator will restart PJ
                      manualy.

                      Within 15-20  minutes,  COLLECTR  should  be  started
                      automatically by PJ.

                  To  verify  that  COLLECTR  and  PJ   have   successfully
                  restarted:

                  1.  Do a systat to see that they are logged  in  for  the
                      current date.

                  2.  Do a systat on "PAM" job number  followed  by  "CONT"
                      (for continued).  This will show PJ running.

                  3.  Do a systat on COLLECTR number followed by CONT.  The
                      two  (2)  digit  numbers  in  the fourth (4th) column
                      should change periodically to show COLLECTR progress.
                      Example - syst(COLLECTOR)/CONT.

                  4.  The Supervisor should be changed when there  are  500
                      accounting  blocks  left  available.   TSTAT and ACCT
                      commands should be performed on a  Supervisor  before
                      moving  to  it.   This  will  give  the status of the
                      Supervisor and its available disk storage space (4305
                      accounting  blocks  for  public  neworks;  27,000 for
                      private networks).

                  5.  If COLLECTR and PJ are both  logged  in  but  do  not
                      appear  to be collecting, notify Fred Cannon or Nancy
                      Burriesci.

                                   NETWORK SHUTS



          I.   PURPOSE
               This procedure is intended as a  guideline  for  individuals
               attempting to control routing paths within the network.  Any
               individual having access authority to PROBE will be required
               to use this structured approach.


          II.  DEFINITIONS
               Shut.  A condition known to the Supervisor that eliminates a
               particular  link  from  consideration  in the cost algorithm
               used in data routing.  Note that  a  shut  is  on  the  link
               level, not on the line level.

               Line.  A connection between two or more  points  over  which
               data is transmitted.  One or more comprise a link.

               Link.  A communications  path  between  any  pair  of  nodal
               communications  processors.   Telecommunicatyions  equipment
               and  procedures   for   transmitting   information   between
               locations in the network.


          III. PROCEDURE

               A. A shut, or multiple shuts, is used by network control  to
                  handle  routing  problems  caused by anomalies or project
                  work.  It constitutes the removal of a link or node  from
                  the network.

               B. Project oriented shuts are used to limit  the  amount  of
                  pass-throughs  that  a  particular node or communications
                  link carries.  Anode scheduled for temorary removal  from
                  the  network  should  have  its  traffic  restricted to a
                  minimum prior to the scheduled outage.

               C. Individuals having a status of 20 in PROBE are capable of
                  initiating shuts on links, facilitating rapid reaction to
                  a variety of situations.

SHUTS


               D. Any shut(s) placed on a network line must be reported  to
                  Network  Control  via  telephone  or OnTyme.  This report
                  should be made before the shut occurs,  or  within  a  30
                  minute timeframe.

               E. Shuts degrade circuit building and  response  times,  and
                  Network  Control personnel will remove unidentified shuts
                  at their discretion.

               F. Nodes will always have one line which enters the  network
                  left  open  (un-shut),  and all dead-ended neighbors left
                  open (un-shut).

               G. Dead-ended customers will not  be  denied  access  to  an
                  interface until it is removed from the network.

               H. Multiline-links do not require a shut if  maintenance  is
                  to  be  performed  on  a link while the link is still up.
                  The exception to this is when a  56KB  multiline-link  is
                  involved,  and the line to be removed is the 56KB section
                  and not the 9.6KB back-up.

               I. When a failure occurs in a 56KB primary line, a  shut  is
                  placed  on the whole link until the 56KB line is restored
                  to the network.  This keeps its 9.6 back-up from becoming
                  overloaded for a sustained period.

               J. NSHUT= Shut complete node
                  RSHUT= Remove shut between two specified nodes
                  ESHUT= Enter a shut specified between two node numbers
                  CLEAR= Remove entire shuts from node specified
                  FULL= (When received after entering a shut command)
                  Indicates that the shut table has exceeded its capacity
                  and can make no more entries at this time.

               K. All shuts entered are recorded on the  active  Supervisor
                  shut  table list, and will remain there until the shut is
                  removed.

               L. All line outages require shuts until they are restored to
                  operation.   An  exception  to  this  is  when  a node is
                  dead-ended.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                              NETWORK SUPERVISOR MOVES



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This document specifies the  procedure  to  be  used  for
                  moving  the  Network  Supervisor.  This procedure will be
                  defined in two different categories.  Scheduled moves and
                  unscheduled moves.


          II.  SCHEDULED MOVES

                  A scheduled Supervisor move is when  the  active  Network
                  Supervisor is put to sleep at a scheduled period of time,
                  and access to the Network is denied until another Network
                  Supervisor  is  awakened, and taken control of 75 percent
                  of the Network (75 percent of the nodes the Sup had  last
                  time active).

              1.  Prior to the actual move, make a copy of  the  ALL  NODES
                  List  (AN),  the  SHUT  TABLE  (LSHUT),  and the COUNT OF
                  MACHINES (COUNT)>

              2.  On the active Supervisor, do TSLEEP, enter the  PASSWORD,
                  but do not do a carriage return at this time.

              3.  On the sleeping Supervisor,  you  are  moving  to,  do  a
                  TWAKE,  enter  the  Password,  but  do  not do a carriage
                  return.

              4.  You are now set to do the actual Supervisor move.

                  A.  Hit a carriage return on the active Supervisor.   You
                      will  get  the  time  the  Supervisor  went to sleep.
                      (024:ll:00:38)

                  B.  Ten seconds after sleeping the active supervisor, hit
                      a carriage return on the sleeping Supervisor you wish
                      to take over  the  Net.   You'll  get  the  time  the
                      Supervisor was awakened.

                      The Supervisor takeover is complete when it  has  all
                      Tymnet  I  and  II  nodes  are  under its control and
                      nothing is in TAKEOVER failure.

                      NOTE: Takeover failure is when a node is stuck in one
                      of its takeover states.  Tymnet I nodes have five (5)
                      states.  Tymnet II has two takeover states.  

                      On the color logger, you'll get the  node  number  of
                      the node in takeover failure and which state the node
                      is currently in.  TYMNET I has states 0-3.  TYMNET II
                      has  state 0 only.  If you cannot correct the problem
                      with a retake of the upstream neighbor, notify  Field
                      Engineering (FE) of that particular region.

              5.  After the takeover is completed, the  following  must  be
                  accomplished.

                  A.  Do a LSTMIN on the Supervisor you have  just  put  to
                      sleep.  Get total logins.

SUPERVISOR MOVES


                  B.  Type version on the active  Supervisor  and  get  the
                      version of code running PROBE, KERNEL and SUPER.

                  C.  Do an ALL NODES  (AN)  and  LIST  SHUTS  (LSHUT)  and
                      COUNT.   Compare  the  LSHUT  from the current active
                      Supervisor with the LSHUT  from  the  Supervisor  you
                      have   just   put  to  sleep.   There  should  be  no
                      difference  on  LSHUT  and  COUNT.   If  there  is  a
                      different  in  the COUNT, use the AN to determine the
                      discrepancy.

              6.  A Netcon incident report  must  be  filled  out  for  all
                  unscheduled supervisor Moves.

                            NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURE


                                SUPERVISOR FAILURES



          I.  PURPOSE

          This procedure provides for orderly restoration in the event of a
          network Supervisor failure.

          II.  DEFINITION

          Supervisor Failure:  A  Supervisor  failure  can  be  defined  as
          anytime   a  Supervisor  leaves  the  network  and  the  stand-by
          Supervisor fails to take control of the network.

          III PROCEDURE

          When the Network Specialists have  determined  that  the  Network
          Supervisor has failed, they should take the following steps:

              1.  Contact the manager for Network Control.

              2.  Check to see that the stand-by terminals  are  logged  in
                  and that they are operational.If stats indicate that more
                  than one Supervisor is active sleep any Supe which is:

                  - Active, but  known  to  be  an  unacceptable  Supe  (as
                    specified by the shift supervisor).
                  - Is higher in number than any other Supe which is awake.

              3.  Call Computer Operations.  Request assistance from one of
                  the  operators.   Have  the  operator look at the display
                  pannel to  identify  the  indicator  in  the  right  most
                  oposition.  The following displays are possible:

                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 1.  This indicates that
                    the Supe is inactive and is recovering from a crash.

SUPERVISOR FAILURES


                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 2.  This indicates that
                    the  Supe  is  inactive,  and  probably  does  not have
                    working Supervisor or Kernel software.
                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 3.  This indicates that
                    the Supe is inactive, frozen, or off of the run queue.
                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 4.  This indicates that
                    the Supe is inactive and sleeping (go to step 6).
                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 5.  This indicates that
                    the Supe is active ( go to step 4).
                  -  Digit  not  alternating.   This  indicates  that   the
                    Supervisor node code is looping or is haulted.

              4.  If more than one Supe is active (alternating  0  and  5),
                  the  Supe with the highest number should be powered down.
                  This is accomplished by turning off the machine with  the
                  keyed  power  switch  located  on  the  left  side of the
                  console.  Restore power  to  the  machine  after  waiting
                  three (3) minutes.

              5.  Continue to monitor the Supes *.

                  * Do nothing if you can't talk via PROBE to an acceptable
                    back-up  Supe.   If  there is no active Supe within ten
                    (10) minutes go to step six (6).
                  * Awaken an acceptable back-up via the TWAKE  command  in
                    PROBE and then go to step nine (9).

              6.  If there is still not  an  active  Supe  after  ten  (10)
                  minutes,   turn   the   key  to  'on'  on  both  engines.
                  Simultaneously press the  'INI'  button  for  the  lowest
                  numbered acceptable Supe.

              7.  If there is not an active Super after ten  (10)  minutes,
                  repeat  the  procedure  in step 6 on the next higher Supe
                  number.  Repeat this procedure every twelve (12)  minutes
                  until  you  run out of Supes.  When you run out of Supes,
                  go to the donut wheel  and  buy  two  (2)  dozen  donuts.
                  Bring  them  back for your fellow operations personnel to
                  eat while  they  scan  the  want-ads,  and  update  their
                  resume's.

              8.  Monitor the takeover.  If all looks  good,  and  you  can
                  log-in, congrats! If it doesn't, go back to step 7.

                                      PROJECTS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The purpose of network project control procedures  is  to
                  schedule  in advance, any and all events occurring in the
                  network.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Network  Project.   A  network  project  is   any   event
                  scheduled   to  occur  within  the  network,  such  as  a
                  reconfiguration, upgrades, additions, and  deletions.   A
                  network  project  may  include  hardware  and/or software
                  events.


          III.  PROCEDURES

              A.  At the  beginning  of  each  shift,  check  all  incoming
                  projects  and  their  current  status.  Note problems and
                  expected project completion dates and times.

              B.  List projects scheduled for future implementation in  the
                  project  log  book  and  file  numerically by date in the
                  project book.  

              C.  Verify  all  codes  issued  on  a  daily  basis.    Match
                  checksums  on  the  checksum  list.   Note that checksums
                  should  be  on  both  the  primary  Go  Load  II  program
                  currently  on  System  70  and  backed  on the secondary,
                  System 25.

              D.  Check all projects along with shut   load  times,  making                                                     _
                  sure  that  all  nodes  are in the checksum list.  Have a
                  project or hand written report scheduled  for  that  day.
                  All   projects  or  hand  written  reports  with  special
                  instructions will be followed as  such  and  document  if
                  instructed otherwise.

              E.  Fill out a detailed project tracking form for every  node
                  involved in a project.

PROJECTS


              F.  When specific instructions have  been  followed  and  all
                  Network  Control responsibilities have been completed for
                  each node, mark it "complete".

              G.  All incomplete items should be  marked  "incomplete"  and
                  documented   on   a   tracking   form  with  the  project
                  description.  If a code problem is involved,  an  attempt
                  should  be made to contact code generators to correct and
                  regenn the code.  If a hardware problem is  involved  and
                  no  OnTyme has been sent concerning its latest status, it
                  should  be  described  on  the  tracking  form  and   all
                  operation  centers should be notified at the beginning of
                  their shifts.

              H.  All projects started on one shift and carried  over  into
                  the next shift, should be marked "In Progress".

              I.  Note all code loads pertaining to scheduled  projects  on
                  the  end-of-shift  summary.   A  detailed  outline of the
                  current status of all code loads completed, in  progress,
                  or not completed, should be sent to all concerned.

                              CHANGE NEIGHBOR COMMAND



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure is to define  the  process  by  which  the
                  change neighbor command is used.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Change neighbor command - This command enables a user  to
                  change  the  indicated  neighbor  on  a line in the nodes
                  memory.  The Supervisor will not make this change to  its
                  node descriptor table until a retake occurs.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  The change neighbor command should only be  used  when  a
                  network  node  cannot  be  taken  down during a scheduled
                  protect reconfiguration, or if a neighbor to a dead-ended
                  node  is  to be reconfigured, or upgraded to a Tymnet II.
                  This command should only be used for temporary conditions
                  until the actual changes can be made in the code, and the
                  nodes are reloaded to refect these changes.  Example:

                  :CN      X       Y       Z
                  :RETAKE  X
                  :BORI    X       Y
                  X = The constant node number
                  Y = The line number in node X
                  Z = The new neighbor number to which the line is to be
                   connected.

                  The change neighbor command will not take effect until  a
                  retake  is Bori.  A notation in the log book is made when
                  this command has been issued.  Note: The change  neighbor
                  command  does  not apply to Tymnet II nodes.  If the node
                  is reloaded with the  same  generation  of  software  the
                  patch will be lost.

                                      TURNOVER




                  I.  PURPOSE

                  This document describes the process used for transferring
                  outage  tickets  and  other information from one shift to
                  the next.


                  II.  DEFINITION

                  Turnover is the process of transferring information about
                  outages  reported  and  actions taken during one shift to
                  the next/previous shift's personnel.


                  III.  PROCEDURE

                  Separate  turnover  procedures  have  been  set  up   for
                  current-shift personnel and for next-shift personnel.

                  A.  Current-shift procedures

                  One hour before the end of the shift, a  summary  of  all
                  node  and  host  outages  must  be  sent  out.  It should
                  include the date/time an outage was reported, as well  as
                  the  most  recent  status  of  the  outage.  It must also
                  account for the shut table in PROBE and  give  status  of
                  all  Supervisors.   This  summary  should  be  created on
                  System 70 and copied to Systems 25 and 28 (see Example).


                  At 22:45GMT a hard copy of TMS display for  hosts,  nodes
                  and  lines must be snapped.  Corresponding outage tickets
                  must exist, and should have been updated within the  last
                  2  hours.   All  outages should have been referred to the
                  proper support group and a record kept on each ticket.


                  Hard  copies  of  PROBE's  Exc,  and  LShut   should   be
                  available.

TURNOVER


                  Copies of the Supervisor Incident Reports and  the  Close
                  Out  Log  should  be stapled to filed closed out tickets.
                  Copies of the Supervisor Incident Reports and  the  Close
                  Out  Log  should  be  deposited  in  the  Network Control
                  Manager's IN basket.



                  B.  Next-shift procedures

                  Read the log book for the two previous shifts.  Look  for
                  problems or requests for action pertinent to the upcoming
                  shift.  Initial all log book pages  read.   Take  a  hard
                  copy  of  all Ontyme hosts and accounting blocks.  Attach
                  this to the log book.


                  Check all terminals, making sure they are logged into the
                  proper  programs.   The  pilot  position should be logged
                  into PROBE under  the  user  name  "Netcon".   Check  all
                  Supervisor  Standby and Consolidator terminals for proper
                  login.  Get information from  previous  controller  about
                  all abnormalities observed.


                  Check Ontyme and project book for any items that may need
                  action  during  upcoming shift.  Put all projects on clip
                  board.


                  Examine all incomplete projects for most  recent/accurate
                  status.


                  Check Collector for proper  operation  (as  described  in
                  Collector procedures).


                  Check the previous shift summary against all  outstanding
                  open node and host outage tickets.  Check that the outage
                  ticket's most recent status description is  the  same  as
                  that of the Shift Summary.


                  Check  the  L-shut  table  against  the  previous   Shift
                  Summary.   Make  sure  all  shuts  are accounted for with
                  brief descriptions.

TURNOVER


                  Take a hard copy of the TMS display for nodes, lines, and
                  hosts  at  14:45GMT.   Verify  that an outasge ticket has
                  been generated on all outages displayed on the hard copy.
                  Check  that  the  last  status of the outage tickets have
                  been updated within the last 2 hours.   Verify  that  all
                  outages   which  should  have  been  referred  to  Telco,
                  Customer Service, or the maintenance  regions  have  been
                  relayed.   Review  each  ticket,  making  sure  that  all
                  procedures have been followed properly.


                  Check all monitor tickets for validity.  Make  sure  that
                  resolutions have resulted in closed out tickets.


                  Read all Netcon mail.


                  Note: Oversights or inaccuracies must be corrected by the
                  previous shift's supervisor or controller.

                            END-OF-SHIFT PROJECT SUMMARY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure is to define the  progress  in  which  the
                  outgoing  shift can account for all scheduled projects in
                  the public network during that shift.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  End of shift project summary.  The end of  shift  project
                  summary  is a detailed status report of all projects on a
                  daily basis which have been executed on a specific shift,
                  and are either completed or incomplete.  Projects pending
                  notification from various  maintenance  groups  in  which
                  network  control  has yet to be notified via telephone or
                  Ontyme, will be  labled  inprogress,  by  the  off  going
                  shift.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  At the end  of  each  shift,  network  control  staff  is
                  required to publish a report via Ontyme called the End of
                  Shift Project Summary.  This report should be concise  on
                  all  projects  attempted,  as  well as completed for that
                  shift.  The report should be generated on Ontyme and sent
                  out  to  *projects.   Hardcopies  on  the project summary
                  should be attached to the shift turnover report for  that
                  specific shift, as well as one on the project clip board.

                                  CIRCUIT TRACING



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the process by which circuits  are
                  traced through the Network.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  The TRACE command traces a circuit in Tymnet  II  from  a
                  specified  host  and  port  on a specified node.  It also
                  traces the Tymnet II portion of a  circuit  that  corsses
                  from  Tymnet  I  into  Tymnet  II.   The trace informatin
                  consists of a list of Tymnet II nodes the circuit  passes
                  through.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  Syntax:  TRACE tymnet II node     Ntymnet I node  channel
                    
                  or       TRACE tymnet II node     Hhost     port 

                  For use with the CHAN command (Section 2.1.5) to trace
                   control circuits,
                  the syntax is:

                            TRACE active-supervisor-sport -node 

                  Description: The TRACE command traces a circuit in Tymnet
                  II  from  a  specified host and port on a specified node.
                  It also traces the Tymnet II portion of  a  circuit  that
                  crosses   from  Tymnet  I  into  Tymnet  II.   The  trace
                  information consists of a list of  Tymnet  II  nodes  the
                  circuit passes through.

                  Following is  a  sample  command  and  response  sequence
                  tracing  a  circuit  ending  on Tymnet II node 2005, host
                  125, and port 5:

                  :TRACE 2005 H125 5
                  HOST 125 PORT 5 2005 2010 2017 NODE 1306 CHANNEL 27

CIRCUIT TRACING


                  Note that the previous  circuit  traced  in  the  example
                  crossed into Tymnet I.

                  When tracing this same circuit starting from the Tymnet I
                  portion,  PROBE  types  the Tymnet II node number TII ( )
                  where   is the decimal channel number used  on  the  link
                  from the Tymnet I node to the Tymnet II node.

                  Example:

                  :CT 1303
                  TII (27) 2005 1306 1326 1303 P19

                  The syntax to trace the Tymnet II portion of the circuit
                   is:

                  TRACE tymnet II node    Ntymnet I node   channel 

                  A sample command/response sequence is:

                  :TRACE 2005 N1306 27
                  NODE 1306 CHANNEL 27 2017 2005 HOST 125 PORT 5

                  NOTE:  The  user  should  be  aware  that  this   command
                  generates  data  flow  in the network and may have a slow
                  response time.


          IV.  LIMITATION

              1.  There is only one trace buffer in the  Supervisor.   This
                  limits  one  execution  of  the  trace  command until the
                  buffer is cleared.  If you get data back and  it  appears
                  wrong,  you may have someone elses command.  The issuance
                  of trace command is sent to the logger in order to  alert
                  you of the buffer uses.

          I.  PURPOSE

                  To establish the necessary attitude needed to insure  the
                  integrity of our network access.


          II.  DEFINITIONS

                  Password - A collection of characters numbering at  least
                  seven  (7)  and  not more than twenty (20).  At least one
                  non-alpha character will be embedded in  the  collection.
                  A semi-colon or a control-M may not be used.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  All passwords will be changed on the first Monday of each
                  month.

              2.  When an employee is  involuntarily  discharged  from  the
                  company,   said   employee  will  be  escorted  from  the
                  building.  After  the  employee  is  out  the  door,  all
                  passwords will be changed.

              3.  In the case of voluntary discharge, the next  shift  will
                  be responsible for changing of all passwords.

              4.  No password will be dispensed to any party out  of  their
                  unit.

              5.  The list of passwords to be changed will be:

                  All - probe user names
                  All - Tymshare host user names
                  All - Network patrol user name
                  Group - Ontyme user name
                  All - Terminal multiplexer user name
                  PIP 10 - Operators license

PASSWORD SECURITY


              6.  Upon termination of  employment  the  unit  manager  will
                  cancel any individual user names, or operator license the
                  person had sole  access  to.   If  the  unit  manager  is
                  unavailable,  then  the  next  available  manager will be
                  notified of the necessary change.

              7.  Passwords will not be  transmitted  via  readable  media.
                  This includes Ontymes.

              8.  Divulging passwords is reprehensible and not  limited  to
                  termination.

          I.  SCOPE

                  To provide a consistency needed to maintain a monitor  of
                  the network.


          II.  DEFINITIONS

                  TMCS = Tymnet Monitoring and Control System


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Define a person to be the data base administrator for the
                  monitoring group.

              2.  This person will need a  minimum  license  of  'UPD'  and
                  'SETN'  with  all  node  and host numbers in the profile.
                  This user name must be valid on all TMCS systems.

              3.  All additions and deletions will have to be made  on  all
                  TMCS  systems  in  order  to  maintain  consistency  with
                  systems.

              4.  The naming conventions will be as follows:

                  A) All node names for  machines  in  North  America  will
                      follow the following format:

                      XXXXXX-DT
                      Where XXXXXX is the node name
                      - is an underscore
                      D is the maintenance district
                      T is the type of application

                      Example for 'D' are:

                      A = China Basin
                      B = Boston and New England District
                      C = Chicago
                      D = Dallas
                      H = Houston
                      L = Los Angeles
                      N = New York
                      P = Philadelphia
                      S = Santa Clara
                      T = Seatle, Wash.
                      V = Denver
                      W = Washington
                      X = Phoenix

                      Example for 'T' are:

                      A = ASYNC Tymsat on an engine
                      B = Base that computer maintenance handles
                      I = Isis
                      S = Switcher
                      V = All varian data machines
                      U = Micro node
                      M = Mini Enginer

                      Example for 'XXXXXX' will bear two ways.

                      If the machine is located at  a  Tymnet  or  Tymshare
                      location,  then the name will be the city in which it
                      is located.

                      If the machine is at a customer  location,  then  the
                      name  will  be  that of the customer, even if it is a
                      Tymnet machine being housed by someone.  We only have
                      access during their work hours.

                      Upon seeing a city as the name then it  is  known  we
                      have access to site any time of the day or night.


                  B) Node names of machines out of North America will  bear
                      the name of the city in which it is located.


                  C) Host names will bear the following formats:

                      XXXXX3270 = 3270 host on Tymnet machine
                      YYYYYYX25 = X25 host on Tymnet machine
                      YYYYYYX75 = X75 host on Tymnet machine
                      XXXXXGATE = Gateway to private network
                      ASYNC     = ASYNC Tymcom slot on customer machine
                      XXXXXBISY = BISYNC Tymcom host on Tymnet machine
                      BISYNC    = BISYNC host on customer machine
                      327ONH    = 3270 Native host on customer machine
                      327OVH    = 3270 Virtual host on customer machine
                      3270VTERM = 3270 Virtual terminal interface
                      3270TERM  = 3270 Terminal interface

                  *Note: Where the host is on  a  customer  machine,  their
                  name  can be deleted from the host name as all host print
                  outs also contain  mention  of  the  machine  it  is  on.
                  Therefore, you do not need to see the name twice.


              5.  Groups found not adhereing to the policy will have  their
                  license removed.

                        STANDBY NETWORK SUPERVISOR TERMINALS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The procedure defines the way the standby Supervisors are
                  utilized.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  The standby Supervisors  have  terminals  located  within
                  Network  Control.   Each terminal will be logged into one
                  of the Network Supervisors, via PROBE> One terminal  will
                  have  an  active  Supervisor, the other terminals will be
                  logged into the other supervisors in a "ready" state.  


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  The standby Network Supervisor terminals  should  be  the
                  first  item  checked when starting turnover.  Each should
                  be logged in via PROBE into Hosts 121, 122, 123, 124  and
                  125  (whatever  hosts are applicable).  The username will
                  be "standby".  There are three primary phone numbers used
                  for  accessing  the Network, these numbers are located on
                  the side of the Supervisor 1 standby terminal.

              2.  Checking the standby terminals, you  should  verify  that
                  the  terminal  is logged into the correct Host.  Check to
                  see that the terminal has a sufficient amount  of  paper.
                  Check  and  verify  the "TIME", the (DF) Drowiness Factor
                  and the state of the standby supervisor.

                  If a Supervisor is found to have a (DF) Drowiness  factor
                  other  than (0) zero, and/or in a state other than Active
                  or Sleeping, should  be  noted  in  the  Network  Control
                  logbook.   Check  wih  the offgoing shift for the current
                  status on these Supervisors.   Also,  a  Network  Control
                  Incident  ticket  should  be  open  until  the problem is
                  resolved.

STANDBY TERMINALS


              3.   A  "LOG  S"  command  will  be  issued  on  all  standby
                  Supervisors.   This  will  give us a logger by seconds on
                  the Active Supervisor.   On  the  other  Supervisors,  we
                  should  get the last time that particular Supervisor went
                  to sleep, whether by command or otherwise.  Each terminal
                  should  be  set  to  run  on  hardcopy, except the Active
                  Supervisor.  The purpose of the hardcopy  is  to  give  a
                  record of takeover, should the active Supervisor fail and
                  a standby Supervisor automatically starts taking over the
                  Net.

              4.  If there is a problem with one of the terminals used  for
                  accessing   the  standby  Supervisors,  another  terminal
                  within Network Control will be designated  as  a  standby
                  terminal until the regular terminal is repaired.

              5.  Each standby terminal should be checked  at  least  three
                  (3) times during each shift, not including turnover.

              6.  Problem with the standby Supervisors and terminals should
                  be reported to the appropriate people.

                  A.   Being  unable  to  log  into  a   sleeping   standby
                      Supervisor  should  be  reported  to  the  Manager of
                      Network Control or designate, and NTD contacts.

                  B.  Ring No Answer (RNA) on our access numbers, should be
                      reported to Western Network Field Engineering (WNFE).

                  C.  Terminal problems will be reported to Hewlitt-Packard
                      for  repair.   Any other problems will be reported to
                      the shift Supervisor.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                              PORT SPEWING CHARACTERS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the steps  taken  when  the  "Port
                  Spewing Characters" message is received.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Port Spewing Characters.  Port Spewing Characters can  be
                  defined as a condition where an asynchonous port is in an
                  open  condition  and  continuously  floods  the   Network
                  Supervisor with characters.  If this condition is allowed
                  to continue, it could possibly cause the  active  Network
                  Supervisor to crash.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  *4/29/83 23:02:28 node  PORT port  <in  decimal>  SPEWING
                  CHARACTERS

                  Event number: 30

                  The specified async port was running  free  and  flooding
                  the supervisor with logon characters.

                  NOTE: *This network message  will  be  displayed  on  the
                  logger whenever a 'SPEWING CHARACTERS' problem occurs.

              1.  Do a retake of the node 'SPEWING CHARACTERS'.  This  will
                  cause  the active Supervisor to take another look at that
                  particular node and hopefully  reset  the  port  that  is
                  'SPEWING CHARACTERS'.

              2.  Notify the regional Network Field  Engineer  and  see  if
                  they can go busy out that port.

PORT SPEWING CHARACTERS


              3.  If a (FE) Field Engineer cannot be reached or if the node
                  is  in  a  remote  location, try taking the node down and
                  reloading it.

              4.  If a reload does not correct your problem, DLOAD the node
                  and leave it down until maintenance can go to the site.

                                DELOADS AND RELOADS



          I.  OVERVIEW

                  A  condition  that  necessitates   loading   code   which
                  includes:  The  introduction  of a new version of code, a
                  change in the local configuration, or reloading  after  a
                  maintenance procedure.

          II.  DEFINITION

              A.  DLOAD: The process by which the first few instructions of
                  executable  code  are entered into the node.  This forces
                  the machine online to go  into  the  boot  strap  program
                  (leave the network), and await further instruction.

              B.  RELOAD: A downline loading program used to load a  binary
                  image  of executable code and interface parameters into a
                  Tymnet technology network.

          III.  PROCEDURE

              A.  Choosing a neighbor node: The controller must be able  to
                  build  a virtual circuit from the host system running the
                  LOADII program to the neighbor node or  the  node  to  be
                  reloaded.   The  neighbor  node must be running and under
                  the Supervisors control.  It must also  have  passthrough
                  capacity.   To  act  as  a downline loading neighbor, the
                  machine must be running a downline  loadable  version  of
                  code itself.  Some Bisync Varian Tymcoms do not meet this
                  requirement.

              B.  Choosing a line: There are differences between loading an
                  Engine,  and  loading  a Varian.  A Varian may have up to
                  sixteen (16) lines.  Only the first eight (8) can be used
                  for  loading.   Engines  may  have  up to thirty-two (32)
                  lines, of which the first sixteen (16) may  be  used  for
                  loading.   Whenever  possible  it  is  recommended that a
                  hardwired line be used for loading both  the  Engine  and
                  the Varian.

              C.   DLOADing  Varians:  It  is  always  recommended  to  the
                  neighbor  on  line  zero (0) when possible.  Varians must
                  always have  the  line  number  of  the  neighbor  chosen
                  specified  when  DLOADing,  and  the same line number and
                  neighbor must be used for RELOADing.  (If a  line  number
                  is omitted from the command, a zero is assumed.

DELOADS AND RELOADS


              D.  DELOADing and RELOADing Engines: No special  instructions
                  are required other than choosing the correct neighbor and
                  line    number.     ***    WARNING:    Physical     lines
                  2,3,6,7,10,11,14  and  15  do  not  raise request to send
                  signals while running the boot strap.  This may  cause  a
                  loss  of  some  records.   It is therefore prefereable to
                  choose a line which does raise request to send.

                       FOR MODEMS ALREADY ON PARADYNE TABLES



          Within  Diagnostic  Functions  Menu,  there  exists  a   Specific
          Interface Test (Letter B):


              1.  Do this test for  the  MASTER  Modem,  check  levels  and
                  status  on  both  pages  of  output  using  the F2 key to
                  advance to the next page.

              2.  Do this test once again for the SLAVE Modem and check the
                  levels and status.


          *NOTE: Check Appendix for an example of Specific  Interface  Test
          results.

PARADYNE TABLES


                      PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW AFTER TEST RESULTS



              I.  If you receive a question mark (?)  in  the  Drop  and/or
                  Line  Field, it indicates a data entry error or a certain
                  location has yet to be added to the Analysis System.


              II.  If you receive Specific Interface Test results:

                  A.  Check both  pages  for  any  alarms  which  may  have
                      occurred.

                  B.  For receive signal level only - the  value  shown  on
                      the  table  is  -3DB off from the actual count due to
                      the  Analysis  System  (example:  -28DB   should   be
                      reported  to  Telco  as -25DB, and so forth).  Levels
                      from -10DB to -24DB are alright.

                  C.   Phase  jitter  and  signal/noise  ratio  should   be
                      interpreted  as  they are shown on the screen.  NOTE:
                      Signal/noise alarm parameters are set based upon line
                      conditioning.


              III.  If you receive a Transmission Failure:

                  A.   Verify  the  PVC  is  working  properly   for   that
                      particular line.

                      Within the Diagnostic  Functions  Menu,  there  is  a
                      Control   Test Menu (Letter C), do the following test                               _
                      from that Menu.

                  B.  'A' Initialize  Remote  Diagnostic  Board  on  MASTER
                      Modem.

                  C.  'A' Initialize RD Board on SLAVE Modem.

                      If both  the  MASTER  and  SLAVE  Modems  fail,  call
                      Maintenance.   If  either  one or both pass, continue
                      on.

                  D.  'E' Self-test remote diagnosis of the  MASTER  modem.
                      If this test fails, have the field engineer check the
                      RD board in the MASTER Modem.  Proceed to do steps BD                                                                          _
                      once again.

                      If  the  test  is  correct,  however,  the  test   to
                      initialize the RD Board, as in Step B fails, have the
                      Field Engineer check strapping on the  RD  Board  and
                      proceed with Steps BD again.                                          _

                  E.  'F' Self-test MASTER  Modem.   If  this  test  fails,
                      check  Interface  (INTF)  Board strapping or replace,
                      then check RD Board strapping or replace.

                      NOTE: This test interferes with system operation  for
                      up  to ten (10) seconds.  Operator should insure that
                      said interference can be tolerated before  initiating
                      the test.

                     11.  Check strapping of INTF Board on MASTER Modem.

                     12.  Replace the INTF Board on the MASTER Modem.

                      If  the  test  is  correct,  however,  the  test   to
                      initialize the RD Board, as in Step C fails, have the
                      Field Engineer check strapping on the RD  Board,  and
                      do the following steps once again, Steps CF.                                                                _

          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the process by  which  TMCS,  XRAY
                  and  PROBE  are  used  by  Network  Control.   A detailed
                  description of TMCS, XRAY and PROBE  and  their  uses  is
                  documented   in  their  appropriate  manuals  located  on
                  Tymnet's System (NETDVDOC:33).  
                  (NETDVDOC:33) PROBE.DOC
                  (NETDVDOC:33) TMCS.DOC
                  (NETDVDOC:33) XRAY.DOC


          II.  DEFINITION

           NOTE: This procedure contains specific user names.  These  names
                  are included as examples only.

              1.  PROBE: PROBE is a utility package  that  resides  on  all
                  Network  Supervisors.   It allows you to query all of the
                  Network nodes, lines and host interfaces and control some
                  supervisor functions.

              2.  TMCS: The Tymnet monitoring and control  system  (Product
                  Title)  is  an inter-active system which provide multiple
                  users with selective access to the status of  the  Tymnet
                  Technology Network.

              3.  XRAY: XRAY is an  interactive  monitoring  and  debugging
                  system  that provides a real-time window into a Tymnet II
                  node.  Through it,  the  user  can  conveniently  display
                  information  about  the node's configuration, performance
                  and history.  Remember, this is only the local node.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  PROBE: Network Control should have  one  terminal  logged
                  into  job  slot of each supervisor at all times.  One (1)
                  should be logged  into  the  active  Supervisor  and  the
                  others should be logged into our standby supervisors.

                  A.  The username "NETCON" will only be used by the  pilot
                      of  the  Network.   All other PROBE terminals will be
                      logged in using the username of "NETCON2".  Remember,
                      there  should  never be two (2) "NETCONS" logged into
                      PROBE at the same time.

                  B.  The standby terminals after being logged into  PROBE,
                      and  the  printer  turned  on, should have an "LOG S"
                      command issued.  This command serves two purposes:

                      1.  It starts a  logger  by  seconds  on  the  active
                          Supervisor.

                      2.  It will give  you  the  last  time  the  inactive
                          Supervisor  went  to sleep.  Also, if the Sup had
                          taken a crash, the time the crash occurred.   The
                          inactive  Supervisor paper log is also set to run
                          in  this  mode,  should  one  of   the   inactive
                          Supervisors start a Takeover.

                  C.  The tasks that are most often  performed  by  Network
                      Control using PROBE:

                      1.  Snapping nodes, hosts and lines
                      2.  Shutting/clearing lines
                      3.  All nodes list
                      4.  Sleeping/waking Supervisors
                      5.  RNODE
                      6. SYNPORT
                      7. DLOAD
                      8. Exceptions List (EXC)
                      9.  TSTAT
                     10.  BORI and T2BORI
                     11.  Change Neighbors
                     12.  LSTMIN
                     13.  PERDAT

                  D.  A PROBE Manual is located in  Network  Control  in  a
                      binder  marked  "PROBE".   Also,  each  controller is
                      required to have their own personal copy  of  "PROBE"
                      and they should be familiar with the commands within.
                      Any  questions  should  be  directed  to  the   Shift
                      Supervisor.

              2.  TMCS.  At the beginning of each  shift,  all  Controllers
                  are  required  to  make  sure  the  required terminals in
                  Network  Control  are  logged  into  TMCS   and   running
                  properly.

                  A.  The required programs used within Network Control:

          PROGRAM            USERNAME               USE

          HOST               NETCON3         MONITOR 24 HOUR HOSTS
          COLORNODE          COLORNODE       MONITOR PUBLIC NODES  HOSTS                                                                  _

          DISPLAY            NETCON/NETCON 2 DISPLAY ALL NETWORK OUTAGES
          GATEWAYS           GATEWAY       MONITOR PRIVATE NET GATEWAYS

                  B.  The primary systems used to run TMCS is  Hosts  40l                                                                             _
                      1400.  Both systems should have identical databases.

                  C.  A TMCS Manual is located  in  Network  Control  in  a
                      binder  marked  "TMCS".   Also, each cntroller should
                      have his own personal copy of "TMCS" and they  should
                      be  familiar with the commands within.  Any questions
                      should be directed to the Shift Supervisor.

              3.  XRAY: XRAY provides a real-time window into a  Tymnet  II
                  node.   Through  it,  the  user  can conveniently display
                  information about the node's  configuration,  performance
                  and  history.   XRAY  also  has  commands  to monitor the
                  status of a node's  links,  trace  activity  and  isolate
                  problems in the node.  Last (and perhaps least) XRAY is a
                  debugging tool for programmers who can use it to diagnose
                  nodecode and network bugs.

                  A.  Network control uses what is known as "REMOTE  XRAY".
                      Remote  access is gained by remotely logging into the
                      kernel host of a node that is up in the network.

                  B.  "ND" - Node Descriptor.  This is the primary  command
                      used  within  Network Control.  This command lets the
                      controller find out more, in less time, about a  node
                      configuration  and current status in the node than he
                      could through any  number  of  PROBE<  TMCS  and  DDT
                      (De-bugger) commands.

                  C.  An "XRAY" manual is located in Network Control  in  a
                      binder  marked  "XRAY".  Also, each controller should
                      have their own personal copy of "XRAY".  They  should
                      be  familiar with the commands within.  Any questions
                      should be directed to the Shift Supervisor.
