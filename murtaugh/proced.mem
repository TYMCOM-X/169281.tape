          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the process by which TMCS,  XRAY                                                                             _
                  PROBE   are   used   by   Network  Control.   A  detailed
                  description of TMCS,  XRAY    PROBE  and  their  uses  is                                              _
                  documented   in  their  appropriate  manuals  located  on
                  Tymshare's    System    (NETDVDOC:33).      (NETDVDOC:33)
                  PROBE.DOC,    (NETDVDOC:33)    TMCS.DOC,    (NETDVDOC:33)
                  XRAY.DOC.


          II.  DEFINITION

              1.  PROBE: PROBE is a utility package  that  resides  on  all
                  Network  Supervisors.   It  alows you to query all of the
                  Network nodes, lines and host interfaces and control some
                  supervisor functions.

              2.  TMCS: The Tymnet monitoring  and  control  system  is  an
                  inter-active  system  which  provide  multiple users with
                  selective access to the status of the  Tymnet  Technology
                  Network.

              3.  XRAY: XRAY is an  interactive  monitoring  and  debugging
                  system  that provides a real-time window into a Tymnet II
                  node.  Through it,  the  user  can  conveniently  display
                  information  about  the node's configuration, performance
                  and history.  Remember, this is only the local node.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  PROBE: Network Control should  have  at  least  five  (5)
                  terminals logged into PROBE at all times.  One (l) should
                  be logged into  the  active  Supervisor  and  the  others
                  should be logged into our standby terminals.

                  A.  The username "NETCON" will only be used by the  pilot
                      of  the  Network.   All other PROBE terminals will be
                      logged  in  using  the  username   of   "NETCON   2".

                                                    PAGE   3



                      Remember,  there  should  never  be two (2) "NETCONS"
                      logged into PROBE at the same time.

                  B.  The standby terminals after being logged into  PROBE,
                      should  have an "LOG S" command issued.  This command
                      serves two purposes:

                      1.  It starts a  logger  by  seconds  on  the  active
                          Supervisor.

                      2.  It will give  you  the  last  time  the  inactive
                          Supervisor  went  to  sleep.  Also, if theSup had
                          taken a crash, the time the crash occurred.   The
                          inactive  Supervisor  log  is  also set to run in
                          this mode, should one of the inactive Supervisors
                          start a Takeover.

                  C.  The tasks that are most often  performed  by  Network
                      Control using PROBE:

                      1.    Snapping   nodes,   hosts    and    lines    2.
                      Shutting/clearing   lines   3.   All  nodes  list  4.

                      LSTMIN 13.  PERDAT

                  D.  A PROBE Manual is located in  Network  Control  in  a
                      binder  marked  "PROBE".   Also,  each  controller is
                      required to have their own personal copy  of  "PROBE"
                      and they should be familiar with the commands within.
                      Any  questins  should  be  directed  to   the   Shift
                      Supervisor.

              2.  TMCS.  At the beginning of each  shift,  all  Controllers
                  are  required  to  make  sure  the  required terminals in
                  Network  Control  are  logged  into  TMCS   and   running
                  properly.

                  A.  The required programs used within Network Control:

                      PROGRAM USERNAME USE

                      HOST  NETCON3  MONITOR  24   HOUR   HOSTS   COLORNODE
                      COLORMODE  MONITOR  PUBLIC  NODES    HOSTS  COLORLINE                                                         _
                      COLORLINE MONITOR LINES COLORINFO  COLORINFO  NETWORK
                      LOGIN  INFORMATION  LOG NETCON/NETCON 2 RUN A NETWORK
                      LOG  DISPLAY  NETCON/NETCON  2  DISPLAY  ALL  NETWORK
                      OUTAGES GATEWAYS GATEWAY MONITOR PRIVATE NET GATEWAYS

                  B.  The primary systems used to run TMCS is  Hosts  40l                                                                             _
                      1400.  Both systems should have identical databases.

                  C.  A TMCS Manual is located  in  Network  Control  in  a
                      binder  marked  "TMCS".   Also, each cntroller should
                      have his own personal copy of "TMCS" and they  should
                      be  familiar  with the commands within.  Any questins
                      should be directed to the Shift Supervisor.

                  3.  XRAY: XRAY provides a real-time window into a  Tymnet
                      II  node.   Through  it,  the  user  can conveniently
                      display information about  the  node's  configuratin,
                      performance  and  history.  XRAY also has commands to
                      monitor the status of a node's links, trace  activity
                      and  isolate problems in the node.  Last (and perhaps
                      least) XRAY is a debugging tool for  programmers  who
                      can use it to diagnose nodecode and network bugs.

                          A.  Network control uses what is known as "REMOTE
                      XRAY".   Remote  access is gained by remotely logging
                      into the kernel host of a node  that  is  up  in  the
                      network.

                  B.  "ND" - Node Descriptor.  This is the primary  command
                      used  within  Network Control.  This command lets the
                      controller find out more, in less time, about a  node
                      configuratin  and  current status in the node than he
                      could through any  number  of  PROBE<  TMCS  and  DDT
                      (De-bugger) commands.

                  C.  An "XRAY" manual is located in Network Control  in  a
                      binder  marked  "XRAY".  Also, each controller should
                      have their own personal copy of "XRAY".  They  should
                      be  familiar  with the commands within.  Any questins
                      should be directed to the Shift Supervisor.

          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the process by which circuits  are
                  traced through the Network.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  The TRACE command traces a circuit in Tymnet  II  from  a
                  specified  host  and  port  on a specified node.  It also
                  traces the Tymnet II portion of a  circuit  that  corsses
                  from  Tymnet  I  into  Tymnet  II.   The trace informatin
                  consists of a list of Tymnet II nodes the circuit  passes
                  through.


          II.  PROCEDURE

                  Syntax: TRACE tymnet II node   Ntymnet I node  channel   
                  or  TRACE  tymnet II node  Hhost   port  For use with the
                  CHAN command (Section 2.1.5.) to trace control  circuits,
                  the syntax is:

TRACE active-supervisor-sport -node 

                  Description: The TRACE command traces a circuit in Tymnet
                  II  from  a  specified host and port on a specified node.
                  It also traces the Tymnet II portion of  a  circuit  that
                  crosses   from  Tymnet  I  into  Tymnet  II.   The  trace
                  information consists of a list of  Tymnet  II  nodes  the
                  circuit passes through.

                  Following is  a  sample  command  and  response  sequence
                  tracing  a  circuit  ending  on Tymnet II node 2005, host
                  125, and port 5:

                  :TRACE 2005 H125 5 HOST 125 PORT 5 2005  2010  2017  NODE
                  1306 CHANNEL 27

                                                    PAGE   9



                  Note that the previous  circuit  traced  in  the  example
                  crossed into Tymnet I.

                                                    PAGE  10



                  When tracing this same circuit starting from the Tymnet I
                  portion,  PROBE  types  the Tymnet II node number TII ( )
                  where   is the decimal channel number used  on  the  link
                  from the Tymnet I node to the Tymnet II node.

                  Example:

                  :CT 1303 TII (27) 2005 1306 1326 1303 P19

                  The syntax to trace the Tymnet II portion of the  circuit
                  is:

                  TRACE tymnet II node   Ntymnet I node  channel 

                  A sample command/response sequence is:

                  :TRACE 2005 N1306 27 NODE 1306 CHANNEL 27 2017 2005  HOST
                  125 PORT 5

                  NOTE:  The  user  should  be  aware  that  this   command
                  generates  data  flow  in the network and may have a slow
                  response time.


          IV.  LIMITATION

              1.  There is only one trace buffer in the  Supervisor.   This
                  limits  one  execution  of  the  trace  command until the
                  buffer is cleared.  If you get data back and  it  appears
                  wrong,  you may have someone elses command.  The issuance
                  of trace command is sent to the logger in order to  alert
                  you of the buffer uses.  CIRCUIT TRACING CIRCUIT TRACING

          PROCEDURE

              1.  All customer problems  involving  lack  of  accessibility
                  will  be  automatically  escalated to the next level when
                  the time frame has passed.

                  *Note: All times are measured from the time  the  problem
                  was originally reported.

              2.  The time  frames  are  established  as  maximum  hours  a
                  problem may remain at one level prior to being escalated.

              3.  Escalation will always be formal notificatin.

              4.  Network Control and Network Systems  Support  Center  are
                  points  in  after  hours  contacts.   At  no  time are we
                  required to screen requests for escalation.

              5.  No personalities are allowed to  be  involved.   If  time
                  passes - so does the escalatin.

              6.  HQTECH has put out a memo on how to get  a  hold  of  its
                  support  person.   This  will  be  used  to  escalate the
                  problem.

              7.  Field Engineering put out a stand-by  contact  procedure.
                  After 30 minutes, it goes to the district manager.

              8.  Upon receiving a software problem from the field,  HQTECH
                  will notify NTS of such problems.

              9.  As problems are  escalated,  responsibility  for  problem
                  resolutin   is   passed   to  the  next  level,  however,
                  accountability for the  problem  remains  at  the  lowest
                  level.

             10.  The organizatin  passing  the  problem  MUST  inform  the
                  apropriate Customer Service Center of this activity.

             11.  The C>C> or N>F>E> will remain  in  the  loop  until  the
                  problem  is  resolved  and  should  keep  the appropriate
                  Customer Service Center updated.

             12.  Customer Services point of contact  will  always  be  the
                  initial contact point (C>C> or N>F>E>).

                            END-OF-SHIFT PROJECT SUMMARY



          I.  PURPOSE

 This procedure is to define the progress in which the outgoing  shift  can
 account  for  all  scheduled  projects  in  the public network during that
 shift.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  End of shift project summary.  The end of  shift  project
                  summary  is a detailed status report of all projects on a
                  daily basis which have been executed on a specific shift,
                  and are either completed or incomplete.  Projects pending
                  notification from various  maintenance  groups  in  which
                  network  control  has yet to be notified via telephone or
                  Ontyme, will be  labled  inprogress,  by  the  off  going
                  shift.

          III.  PROCEDURE

                  At the end  of  each  shift,  network  control  staff  is
                  required to publish a report via Ontyme called the End of
                  Shift Project Summary.  This report should be concise  on
                  all  projects  attempted,  as  well as completed for that
                  shift.  The report should be generated on Ontyme and sent
                  out  to  *projects.   Hardcopies  on  the project summary
                  should be attached to the shift turnover report for  that
                  specific shift, as well as one on the project clip board.

                                NETWORK HOST OUTAGE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This document specifies the procedures to be used for all
                  Network Host Interface Outages.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Host Interface Outage.  The definition of a host or  slot
                  interface  outage  is  when  the  host  or  interface  is
                  unaccessable through the Network, and  is  showing  shut,
                  down or missing.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  This procedure  needs  the  concurrent  work  of  network
                  control,  field  engineering,  customer  service  and the
                  communications consultants.

              1.   Network  control  is  responsible  for  detecting   host
                  anomalies on hosts which are normally answered 24 hours a
                  day.

              2.  Upon detection of an  anomaly  (down,  shut  or  missing)
                  network  control  will make an evaluatin of the slot code
                  and notify customer service.

              3.  For the purpose of reporting,  network  control  will  be
                  responsible for contacting field engineering and customer

                                                    PAGE  14



                  service will be responsible for contacting communications
                  consultants.

              4.  Network control will determine within  means  whether  an
                  anomaly is hardware or software caused.

              5.   When  a  determination   cannot   be   rendered,   Field
                  Engineering  will  be  contacted  to  have  tthe line and
                  modems tested.  Normal follow-up will be used.

                                                    PAGE  15



              6.  If the line is tested okay and the ly has  not  been
                  cleared  then the problem will be turned over to customer
                  service.  A line outage will then be  handled  by  Netcon
                  through a phone company.

              7.  Customer  service  will  be  responsible  for  getting  a
                  communicatin  consultant  notified  and  working  on  the
                  anomaly.

              8.  If a communicatin consultant feels that the  transmission
                  medium  is  not  functioning  properly  than software and
                  hardware people will work together as a team  to  correct
                  the problem.

              9.  All line problems  will  be  turned  over  to  the  phone
                  companies  via  network  control.   NETWORK  HOST  OUTAGE

                             NETWORK CONTROL PROCEDURES


                                NETWORK NODE OUTAGE



          I.   PURPOSE
               This procedure outlines actions to be taken in the event  of
               a Network Node Outage.

               II.  DEFINITION

               NETWORK NODE OUTAGE: A network node outage is defined  as  a
               node which is not accessable, nor can it be accounted for by
               the  network   Supervisor.    This   may   result   from   a
               hardware/software  malfunction,  or  a transmission facility
               company problem.

               III.  PROCEDURE

               In the event of  a  public  network  node  failure,  Network
               Control will follow the procedure below to restore service:

           A.  Wait for ten minutes to determine if the outage will clearA.
               Wait  for  ten minutes to determine if the outage will clear
               itself (ie.  power failure).

              1.  If the outage clears,  record  the  outage  per  existing
                  documented procedures.  

              2.  If the problem does not clear, proceed to the next step.

           B.  Site Evaluation: This step involves calling the site of  the
               nodal  location for evaluation of Telco equipment, machinery
               environment, customer equipment and nodal hardware.  It will
               be  necessary  to  call  the site and locate someone that is
               familiar with the node and its associated equipment.

              1.  Determine if the customer has taken the node down for any
                  reason.   If  yes, ask to be notified when it is returned
                  to service.  Leave a call back number and then OnTyme the
                  field engineering group.

              2.  Determine if there has  been  an  environmental  failure.
                  Environmental  problems  are  defined as a loss of power,
                  loss of air conditioning (A/C), or a site fire.   In  the
                  event of an environmental failure, proceed as follows:

                                                    PAGE  17



                  * Ask to be notified when the environment returns to 
                    normal.

                  * Leave call-back information.

                  * Send OnTyme to the regional field engineering
                   personnel.

                  If the environment has returned to normal,  continue  the
                  evaluation.

              3.  Have the customer perform  a  visual  inspection  of  the
                  node.   Determine if the node is in an operational state.
                  If it is not, notify netowrk  field  engineering  of  the
                  outage.  Specify the type of equipment involved.

              4.  Perform and evaluation of associated equipment.  Have the
                  customer visually inspect the modem or DSU for an obvious
                  malfunction.  Perform  tests  on  the  DSU  or  modem  as
                  appropriate including loopback test and self tests.

                  * If either of these test should fail, report the problem
                    and results to appropriate Telco group or modem vendor.

                  * Send an OnTyme to maintenance to advise of status.

           5.  If all of the  above  items  prove  inconclusive,  then  the
               problem should be reported to Netowrk Field Engineering.

           6.  If  it  is  not  possible  to  contact  the  site  do  to  a
               ring-no-answer  (R/NA),  Netcon  will  attempt  to  dump and
               reload the node (notify the maintenance group via OnTyme).

           7.  During regular working hours, node outages will be  reported
               to  the  appropriate field engineering region via telephone,
               and then followed up with and OnTyme (an OnTyme will also be
               sent when the node returns to the Network).

                             NETWORK CONTROL PROCEDURE


                                DELOADS AND RELOADS



               I.  OVERVIEW

               A condition that necessitates loading code  which  includes:
               Tthe  introduction of a new version of code, a change in the
               local  configuration,  or  reloading  after  a   maintenance
               procedure.

               II.  DEFINITION

              A.  DLOAD: The process by which the first few instructions of
                  executable  code  are entered into the node.  This forces
                  the machine online to go  into  the  boot  strap  program
                  (leave the network), and await further instruction.

              B.  RELOAD: A downline loading program used to load a  binary
                  image  of executable code and interface parameters into a
                  Tymnet technology network.

          III.  PROCEDURE

              A.  Choosing a neighbor node: The controller must be able  to
                  build  a virtual circuit from the host system running the
                  LOAD II program to the neighbor node or the  node  to  be
                  reloaded.   The  neighbor  node must be running and under
                  the Supervisors control.  It must also  have  passthrough
                  capacity.   To  act  as  a downline loading neighbor, the
                  machine must be running a downline  loadable  version  of
                  code itself.  Some Bisync Varian Tymcoms do not meet this
                  requirement.

              B.  Choosing a line: There are differences between loading an
                  Engine,  and  loading  a Varian.  A Varian may have up to
                  sixteen (16) lines.  Only the first eight (8) can be used
                  for  loading.   Engines  may  have  up to thirty-two (32)
                  lines, of which the first sixteen (16) may  be  used  for
                  loading.   Whenever  possible  it  is  recommended that a
                  hardwired line be used for loading both  the  Engine  and
                  the Varian.

              C.   DLOADing  Varians:  It  is  always  recommended  to  the
                  neighbor  on  line  zero (0) when possible.  Varians must
                  always have  the  line  number  of  the  neighbor  chosen
                  specified  when  DLOADing,  and  the same line number and
                  neighbor must be used for RELOADing.

                                                    PAGE  20



              D.  DELOADing and RELOADing Engines: No special  instructions
                  are required other than choosing the correct neighbor and
                  line    number.     ***    WARNING:    Physical     lines
                  2,3,6,7,10,11,14  and  15  do  not  raise request to send
                  signals while running the boot strap.  This may  cause  a
                  loss  of  some  records.   It is therefore prefereable to
                  choose a line which does raise request to send.

                                    LINE OUTAGES



          I.  PURPOSE

          This document  specifies  the  procedures  to  be  used  for  all
          synchronous network line outages.


          II.  DEFINITION

      A.  Network Line Outage: Loss of the availability of a  network  node
          to  communicate  with  any  other node via a transmission medium.
          This would include leased telephone company provided circuits.

      B.  Types of lines:

           1.  Hardwired Lines: A connection between two nodes.  The  nodes
               cannot be more than four-hundred (400) feet apart.  They are
               connected from synchronous port to synchronous port  without
               the use of modems to transduce the digital data signals.

           2.  Memory Shuffler: A high speed connection between  two  nodes
               which  uses coaxial cable.  This is also a form of Hardwired
               circuit.   The  transmission  medium  handles  current  loop
               transmission  instead  of  digital  data  as  in a hardwired
               environment.

           3.  Long Line: A 3002 channel  leased  line  from  ATT  or  it's                                                                _
               competitor.   It  may  have  Tymnet (CPE) modems or American
               Bell modems.  It may also be leased from  and  International
               Record Carrier.

      C.  Identification

           1.  The  primary  tool  used  for  identifying  failure  of  the
               aforementioned lines is the TMCS (NET PATROL) program.  Each
               time a line, link or node fails, it is reported by  the  NET
               PATROL  logger.  To detect line outages you should be logged
               in  under  the  username  of  'colorline'  or  the  username
               'netcon'.

               Once the outage is detected on the TMCS logger  or  display,
               the  controller  may  verify  the  trouble  by interrogating

                                                    PAGE  23



               'PROBE'.  If the line is not functioning PROBE  will  report
               the  line as OUT (Tymnet I).  If you are looking at a Tymnet
               II node, the controller may see the line as  OUT,  but  more
               often  than  not the line will not be shown.  Doing a SYNPRT
               command in PROBE will allow the controller to see all  links
               on the Tymnet II node.  

               Logging into XRAY via the Kernel host is a far better way to
               determine  the  status of links (Tymnet II only).  XRAY will
               report the last time that the link went up or down, as  well
               as report any error condition that may exist on a line.

          III.  PROCEDURE - Domestic and International Line Outage

              A.  Generate an outage ticket for all lines that show OUT  on
                  the TMCS monitor.


                DOMESTIC

                    Refer to the circuit map file for  the  circuit  number
                    and reporting number.

                A.  If the circuit map  states  HW,  this  is  a  hardwired
                    circuit  and  should  be  reported  to  the appropriate
                    maintenance region for repair.

                B.  If a circuit number and trouble  reporting  number  are
                    listed  in the circuit map, the controller should check
                    to see if the circuit  is  connected  to  the  Analysis
                    System.   If  the  circuit is connected to the Analysis
                    System refer to the Analysis System procedures.  If the
                    circuit  is not connected to the Analysis System, refer
                    the  problem  to  the  telephone  company.   When   the
                    controller  reports  the  circuit, he/she should report
                    the problem as 'unable to send or receive  data'.   The
                    controller  should  request  the ticket number that the
                    telephone company has assigned  to  the  problem.   The
                    controller  should  also  request  the  initials of the
                    person at Telco that wrote the ticket.  Once the ticket
                    has   been  referred  to  the  telephone  company,  the
                    controller should notify  the  appropriate  maintenance
                    region of the status (ie.  out to Telco).

                    In the event that Telco clears the line as  no  problem
                    found  (ie  found  good  loops  and levels), the ticket
                    should be then referred to the appropriate  maintenance
                    group  for further investigation.  This referral can be
                    done either over by phone or by OnTyme (use OnTyme  for
                    non-prime time referrals).

                C.  In the event that the controller is  unable  to  locate
                    the  circuit  number  for  the line in question, he/she

                                                    PAGE  24



                    must request the circuit number  from  the  responsible
                    maintenance  region.   In  the  event  that  the outage
                    should occur at a non-prime-time hour,  the  controller
                    should  sent  an  OnTyme to the responsible maintenance
                    group advising them of the outage (maintenance does not
                    pursue  line  outages  after prime time - the exception
                    being hardwired circuits).

                D.  In the event that the controller is  unable  to  locate
                    the  telephone company trouble reporting number for the
                    circuit,  he/she  chould  contact  out  ATT   dedicated                                                              _
                    account  representatives.   If  the outage should occur
                    after hours, the controller should  record  the  reason
                    that  he/she  was  unable  to  turn  the problem out to
                    Telco.

          ** Note: ALL tickets that need referral to the telephone 
             company should go through Network Control. If a 
             maintenace or technical group should request a referral 
             to Telco, they must give a valid reason for the referral.

                INTERNATIONAL

                    Determine which International Record Carrier  (IRC)  is
                    responsible for the circuit.

                A.  If  the  circuit  runs  from  a  domestic  site  to  an
                    international  sit  (ie  Newark,  new  Jersey  to Paris
                    France),  the  circuit  should  be  reported   to   the
                    appropriate IRC.  The controller should record the name
                    of the person at the IRC which took the trouble  ticket
                    information.

                B.  For Japanese line outages the  controller  must  follwo
                    specific   procedures   for   restoration  of  Japanese
                    overseas lines.

                C.  Should the circuit run from an  overseas  point  to  an
                    overseas  point  (ie.   Paris  to Rome), the controller
                    should  OnTyme  both  maintenance   regions   involved.
                    NETCON  should be coppied on all OnTymes sent.  Updates
                    should be sent at least once each shift.

          ** NOTE: Status should be checked and recorded at least 
             once every two (2) hours. Staus should be sent to 
             all maintenance parties involved, as well as all IRC's 
             involved. If the controller receives any new or additional
             information (ie. circuit number or trouble reporting 
             number) this information should be given to the shift 
             supervisor. Any questions regarding this procedure   
             should be directed to the shift supervisor.

                             NETWORK CONTROL PROCEDURE


                                SUPERVISOR FAILURES



          I.  PURPOSE

          This procedure provides for orderly restoration in the event of a
          network Supervisor failure.

          II.  DEFINITION

          Supervisor Failure:  A  Supervisor  failure  can  be  defined  as
          anytime   a  Supervisor  leaves  the  network  and  the  stand-by
          Supervisor fails to take control of the network.

          III PROCEDURE

          When the Network Controllers have  determined  that  the  Network
          Supervisor has failed, they should take the following steps:

              1.  Contact the manager for Network Control.

              2.  Check to see that the stand-by terminals  are  logged  in
                  and that they are operational.If stats indicate that more
                  than one Supervisor is active sleep any Supe which is:

                  - Active, but  known  to  be  an  unacceptable  Supe  (as
                    specified by the shift supervisor).
                  - Is higher in number than any other Supe which is awake.

              3.  Call Computer Operations.  Request assistance from one of
                  the  operators.   Have  the  operator look at the display
                  pannel to  identify  the  indicator  in  the  right  most
                  oposition.  The following displays are possible:

                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 1.  This indicates that
                    the Supe is inactive and is recovering from a crash.
                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 2.  This indicates that
                    the  Supe  is  inactive,  and  probably  does  not have
                    working Supervisor or Kernel software.
                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 3.  This indicates that
                    the Sype is inactive, frozen, or off of the run queue.
                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 4.  This indicates that
                    the Supe is inactive and sleeping (go to step 6).
                  - Digit alternating between 0 and 5.  This indicates that

                                                    PAGE  27
SUPERVISOR FAILURES


                    the Supe is active ( go to step 4).
                  -  Digit  not  alternating.   This  indicates  that   the
                    Supervisor node code is looping or is haulted.

              4.  If more than one Supe is active (alternating  0  and  5),
                  the  Supe with the highest number should be powered down.
                  This is accomplished by turning off the machine with  the
                  keyed  power  switch  located  on  the  left  side of the
                  console.  Restore power  to  the  machine  after  waiting
                  three (3) minutes.

              5.  Continue to monitor the Supes *.

                  * Do nothing if you can't talk via PROBE to an acceptable
                    back-up  Supe.   If  there is no active Supe within ten
                    (10) minutes go to step six (6).
                  * Awaken an acceptable back-up via the TWAKE  command  in
                    PROBE and then go to step nine (9).

              6.  If there is still not  an  active  Supe  after  ten  (10)
                  minutes,   turn   the   key  to  'on'  on  both  engines.
                  Simultaneously press the  'INI'  button  for  the  lowest
                  numbered acceptable Supe.

              7.  If there is not an active Super after ten  (10)  minutes,
                  repeat  the  procedure  in step 6 on the next higher Supe
                  number.  Repeat this procedure every twelve (12)  minutes
                  until  you  run out of Supes.  When you run out of Supes,
                  go to the donut wheel  and  buy  two  (2)  dozen  donuts.
                  Bring  them  back for your fellow operations personnel to
                  eat while  they  scan  the  want-ads,  and  update  their
                  resume's.

              8.  Monitor the takeover.  If all looks  good,  and  you  can
                  log-in, congrats! If it doesn't, go back to step 7.

                             NETWORK CONTROL PROCEDURES


                                   NETWORK SHUTS



          I.   PURPOSE
               This procedure is intended as a  guideline  for  individuals
               attempting to control routing paths within the network.  Any
               individual having access authority to PROBE will be required
               to use this structured approach.


          II.  DEFINITIONS
               Shut.  A condition known to the Supervisor that eliminates a
               particular  link  from  consideration  in the cost algorithm
               used in data routing.  Note that  a  shut  is  on  the  link
               level, not on the line level.

               Line.  A connection between two or more  points  over  which
               data is transmitted.  One or more comprise a link.

               Link.  A communications  path  between  any  pair  of  nodal
               communications  processors.   Telecommunicatyions  equipment
               and  procedures   for   transmitting   information   between
               locations in the network.


          III. PROCEDURE

               A. A shut, or multiple shuts, is used by network control  to
                  handle  routing  problems  caused by anomalies or project
                  work.  It constitutes ah the removal of a  link  or  node
                  from the network.

               B. Project oriented shuts are used to limit  the  amount  of
                  pass-throughs  that  a  particular node or communications
                  link carries.  Anode scheduled for temorary removal  from
                  the  network  should  have  its  traffic  restricted to a
                  minimum prior to the scheduled outage.

               C. Individuals having a status of 20 in PROBE are capable of
                  initiating shuts on links, facilitating rapid reaction to
                  a variety of situations.

               D. Any shut(s) placed on a node, link or  line  ??  must  be
                  reported  to  Network  Control  via  telephone or OnTyme.

SUPERVISOR FAILURES


                  This report should be made before  the  shut  occurs,  or
                  within a reasonable timeframe.  ??

               E. Shuts degrade circuit building and  response  times,  and
                  Network  Control personnel will remove unidentified shuts
                  at their discretion.

               F. Nodes will always have one line which enters the  network
                  left  open  (un-shut),  and all dead-ended neighbors left
                  open (un-shut).

               G. Dead-ended customers will not  be  denied  access  to  an
                  interface until it is removed from the network.

               H. Multiline-links do not require a shut if  maintenance  is
                  to  be  performed  on  a link while the link is still up.
                  The exception to this is when a  56KB  multiline-link  is
                  involved,  and the line to be removed is the 56KB section
                  and not the 9.6KB back-up.

               I. When a failure occurs in a 56KB primary line, a  shut  is
                  placed  on the whole link until the 56KB line is restored
                  to the network.  This keeps its 9.6 back-up from becoming
                  overloaded for a sustained period.

               J. NSHUT= Shut complete node ?? RSHUT= Remove  shut  between
                  two specified nodes ESHUT= Enter a shut specified between
                  two node numbers CLEAR= Remove  entire  shuts  from  node
                  specified  FULL=  (When  received  after  entering a shut
                  command) Indicates that the shut table has  exceeded  its
                  capacity and can make no more entries at this time.

               K. All shuts entered are recorded on the  active  Supervisor
                  shut  table list, and will remain there until the shut is
                  removed.

               L. All line outs require shuts until they  are  restored  to
                  operation.  ?? NETWORK SHUTS NETWORK SHUTS

                             NETWORK CONTROL PROCEDURE


                                     COLLECTOR
                  I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure describes the method  and  process  to  be
                  used  when  monitoring  accounting  blocks.  It will also
                  explain the process for monitoring the  accounting  block
                  support program (Collector).


                  II.  DEFINITION

              A.  Accounting Blocks - This is a  space  on  a  Supervisor's
                  disk that stores accounting daytas.  The space is divided
                  into  4305  (variable)  accounting  records.    The   raw
                  information  is  stored  in  1000  characters per minute.
                  When the blocks reach zero, the Supervisor starts writing
                  over old accounting information.

              B.  Collector - This  program  creates  a  duplicate  of  the
                  accounting  blocks, providing a backup file of the disk's
                  information.  If the maximum 4305  (variable)  accounting
                  records  are  filled,  causing  the  Supervisor  to start
                  writing over old information, the old information is  not
                  lost.  


          III.  PROCEDURE

          The accounting blocks should be  monitored  through  all  shifts.
          This  is  accomplished  by  watching the color monitors and using
          PROBE's "ACCT" command.

          When 33% of the total available accounting  blocks  are  left,  a
          message  will be displayed across TMS color monitors.  The latest
          accounting  block  total  will  be  displayed  until  either  the
          Supervisor  is  changed,  or  more  than 33% of the blocks become
          available.

          A message of 33%  or  less  availability  signifies  a  Collector
          danger  zone.  The Supervisor must be changed to avoid having old
          information "written over".

          At the danger  zone,  and  after  every  Supervisor  change,  the
          Collector program should be checked for proper operation.

          Collector checks are implemented via the following steps:

             l.  Log in to System 74 (i.e.  Netco:74;password).  

                                                    PAGE  31



             2.  Set system license (i.e.  O ALL - carriage return; 
                 Netcon - carriage return; Password.)

          The following Collector features should be checked:

              1.  Do a systat command (See example).  Check  to  make  sure
                  that  PJ  is  logged in.  This will be under the job name
                  "PAM".
              2.  Check to make sure that  Collector  is  logged  into  the
                  active  Supervisor.   Check to see ifit is creating files
                  for the current date.  The job name will be "CPN   ".


                  If either  PJ  or  Collector  are  not  logged  in,  call
                  Fremont.   The  System 74 operator will have instructions
                  for  manually  restarting  PJ.   They  are  outlined   as
                  follows:

              1.  NetCon should instruct the system operator to log-off the
                  job running under username PJ, and shut the system.

              2.  The operator will log the job off and shut the system  by
                  typing  "SCHED  400000" at the exec level.  The operators
                  have the license to do this.

                  After a  few  minutes,  the  operator  will  un-shut  the
                  system.   On  System  74,  the  operator  will restart PJ
                  manually.

                  Within  15-20  minutes,  COLLECTR   should   be   started
                  automatically by PJ.


          To verify that COLLECTR and PJ have successfully restarted:

              1.  Do a systat to  see  that  they  are  logged-in  for  the
                  current date.

              2.  Do a systat on "PAM" job number followed by  "CONT"  (for
                  continued).  This will show PJ running.

              3.  Do a systat on COLLECTR number followed by CONT.  The two
                  (2)  digit  numbers  in  the  fourth  (4th) column should
                  change periodically to show COLLECTR progress.

              4.  The Supervisor should  be  changed  when  there  are  500
                  accounting   blocks   left  available.   TSTAT  and  ACCT
                  commands should  be  performed  on  a  Supervisor  before
                  moving   to  it.   This  will  give  the  status  of  the
                  Supervisor and its available  disk  storage  space  (4305
                  accounting blocks for public networks; 27,000 for private
                  networks).

              5.  If COLLECTR and PJ are both logged in but do  not  appear
                  to be sollecting, notify Fred Cannon or Nancy Burriesci.

                           NETWORK OUTAGE TICKET




          I.  PURPOSE

          This procedure defines the method  and  format  to  be  used  for
          generation  of  Netcon  Incident  Report tickets.  It includes an
          example of a correctly organized and  formatted  Netcon  Incident
          Report.


          II.  DEFINITION

          A Netcon Incident Report is generated each time a network  outage
          occurs,  regardless  of  its duration.  It describes each outage,
          including customer name, node number(s), and actions taken.


          III.  PROCEDURE

          A Netcon Incident Report Ticket must be generated by a Controller
          monitoring  the  public  network  on any and all network outages.
          This form should contain all relevant information concerning  the
          outage.  See attached examples.


          Once the network outage has been remedied,  the  Netcon  Incident
          Report  should  be  closed  and  attached to the shift's Turnover
          Report.  A  description  of  the  problem  resolution  should  be
          included.   Monitor tickets are to be kept open no longer than 24
          hours.

               CREATING and SENDING LINE ESCALATION REPORTS




          I.  PURPOSE

          This procedure explains how to  prepare  and  distribute  a  Line
          Escalation  Report.   This  report  is distributed to a number of
          Maintenance and Support Groups for informational purposes.


          II.  DEFINITION

          A Line Escalation Report lists all line outages over  a  24  hour
          period.   It  provides  the  recipient  with a description of the
          outage's most recent status and tells how  long  the  outage  has
          lasted.


          III.  PROCEDURE

          The following  steps  should  be  followed  in  creating  a  Line
          Escalation Report:

              A.  Gather all line outage tickets and put them in  numerical
                  order, with each outage's lowest node number first.

              B.  Log into System 70 and create a file in Editor.   A  file
                  header  should  tell  who  the  report is from, who it is
                  being sent to, its subject,  and  the  date/time  of  its
                  preparation.

              C.  List all line outages with date of  outage,  line  outage
                  node   numbers   preceded   by   its  maintenance  region
                  identifier (I=International, E=Eastern Field Engineering,
                  W=Western     Field    Engineering,    C=Central    Field
                  Engineering).

              D.  Describe the outage's most recent status,  including  its
                  date and time.

              E.  After listing all  pertinent  line  outages,  place  file
                  under  an  Ontyme  file name and copy/send to appropriate
                  personnel.

                  I.  PURPOSE

                  This document describes the process used for transferring
                  outage  tickets  and  other information from one shift to
                  the next.


                  II.  DEFINITION

                  Turnover is the process of transferring information about
                  outages  reported  and  actions taken during one shift to
                  the next/previous shift's personnel.


                  III.  PROCEDURE

                  Separate  turnover  procedures  have  been  set  up   for
                  current-shift personnel and for next-shift personnel.

                  A.  Current-shift procedures

                  One hour before the end of the shift, a  summary  of  all
                  node  and  host  outages  must  be  sent  out.  It should
                  include the date/time an outage was reported, as well  as
                  the  most  recent  status  of  the  outage.  It must also
                  account for the shut table in PROBE and  give  status  of
                  all  Supervisors.   This  summary  should  be  created on
                  System 70 and copied to Systems 25 and 28 (see Example).


                  At 22:457 a hard copy of TMS display  for  hosts,  nodes,
                  and  lines must be snapped.  Corresponding outage tickets
                  must exist, and should have been updated within the  last
                  2  hours.   All  outages should have been referred to the
                  proper support group and a record kept on each ticket.


                  Hard copies of PROBE's  Exc,  Au,  and  LShut  should  be
                  available.


                  Copies of the Supervisor Incident Reports and  the  Close
                  Out  Log  should  be stapled to filed closed out tickets.
                  Copies of the Supervisor Incident Reports and  the  Close
                  Out  Log  should  be  deposited  in  the  Network Control

                  Manager's IN basket.



                  B.  Next-shift procedures

                  Read the log book for the two previous shifts.  Look  for
                  problems or requests for action pertinent to the upcoming
                  shift.  Initial all log book pages  read.   Take  a  hard
                  copy  of  all Ontyme hosts and accounting blocks.  Attach
                  this to the log book.


                  Check all terminals, making sure they are logged into the
                  proper  programs.   The  pilot  position should be logged
                  into PROBE under  the  user  name  "Netcon".   Check  all
                  Supervisor  Standby and Consolidator terminals for proper
                  login.  Get information from  previous  controller  about
                  all abnormalities observed.


                  Check Ontyme and project book for any items that may need
                  action  during  upcoming shift.  Put all projects on clip
                  board.


                  Examine all incomplete projects for most  recent/accurate
                  status.


                  Check Collector for proper  operation  (as  described  in
                  Collector procedures).


                  Check the previous shift summary against all  outstanding
                  open node and host outage tickets.  Check that the outage
                  ticket's most recent status description is  the  same  as
                  that of the Shift Summary.


                  Check  the  L-shut  table  against  the  previous   Shift
                  Summary.   Make  sure  all  shuts  are accounted for with
                  brief descriptions.


                  Take a hard copy of the TMS display for nodes, lines, and
                  hosts  at 14:457.  Verify that an outasge ticket has been
                  generated on all outages  displayed  on  the  hard  copy.
                  Check  that  the  last  status of the outage tickets have
                  been updated within the last 2 hours.   Verify  that  all
                  outages   which  should  have  been  referred  to  Telco,
                  Customer Service, or the maintenance  regions  have  been
                  relayed.   Review  each  ticket,  making  sure  that  all

                                                    PAGE  39



                  procedures have been followed properly.


                  Check all monitor tickets for validity.  Make  sure  that
                  resolutions have resulted in closed out tickets.


                  Read all Netcon mail.


                  Note: Oversights or inaccuracies must be corrected by the
                  previous  shift's  supervisor  or  controller.   TURNOVER

          I.   PURPOSE
               This procedure describes the  process  by  which  a  Network
               Supervisor crash is handled.


          II.  DEFINITION
               Supervisor crash: A Supervisor  crash  occurs  when  a  node
               running Supervisor code crashes causes a Supervisor to leave
               the network.  SUPERVISOR CRASHES SUPERVISOR CRASHES

          I.  PURPOSE

                  The purpose of network project control procedures  is  to
                  schedule  in advance, any and all events occurring in the
                  network.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Network  Project.   A  network  project  is   any   event
                  scheduled   to  occur  within  the  network,  such  as  a
                  reconfiguration, upgrades, additions, and  deletions.   A
                  network  project  may  include  hardware  and/or software
                  events.


          III.  PROCEDURES

              A.  At the  beginning  of  each  shift,  check  all  incoming
                  projects  and  their  current  status.  Note problems and
                  expected project completion dates and times.

              B.  List projects scheduled for future implementation in  the
                  project  log  book  and  file  numerically by date in the
                  project book.  

              C.  Verify  all  codes  issued  on  a  daily  basis.    Match
                  checksums  on  the  checksum  list.   Note that checksums
                  should  be  on  both  the  primary  Go  Load  II  program
                  currently  on  System  70  and  backed  on the secondary,
                  System 25.

              D.  Check all projects along with shut   load  times,  making                                                     _
                  sure  that all nodes are in the checksum list.  ?? Have a
                  project or hand written report scheduled  for  that  day.
                  All   projects  or  hand  written  reports  with  special
                  instructions will be followed as  such  and  document  if
                  instructed otherwise.

              E.  Fill out a detailed project tracking form for every  node
                  involved in a project.

                                                    PAGE  42



              F.  When specific instructions have  been  followed  and  all
                  Network  Control responsibilities have been completed for
                  each node, mark it "complete".

              G.  All incomplete items should be  marked  "incomplete"  and
                  documented   on   a   tracking   form  with  the  project
                  description.  If a code problem is involved,  an  attempt
                  should  be made to contact code generators to correct and
                  regenn the code.  If a hardware problem is  involved  and
                  no  OnTyme has been sent concerning its latest status, it
                  should  be  described  on  the  tracking  form  and   all
                  operation  centers should be notified at the beginning of
                  their shifts.

              H.  All projects started on one shift and carried  over  into
                  the next shift, should be marked "In Progress".

              I.  Note all code loads pertaining to scheduled  projects  on
                  the  end-of-shift  summary.   A  detailed  outline of the
                  current status of all code loads completed, in  progress,
                  or  not  completed,  should  be  sent  to  all concerned.

                          THIRD SHIFT OPERATION PROCEDURES


          I.  SHIFT TURNOVER

              A.  Before taking over  the  shift,  check  the  TMS  Monitor
                  against  outstanding open tickets.  Make sure all tickets
                  are annotated correctly.  Make sure all outages have been
                  updated  during the previous shift (the number of updates
                  may vary).

              B.  Check the shut table (LSHUT) against the  shift  turnover
                  summary.  Investigate each line that is shut to determine
                  its validity.  Each shut that cannot be explained by  the
                  previous shift should be removed.

              C.  Check the status of all 'standby' terminals.   Make  sure
                  each  is  logged  into  the proper supervisor host.  If a
                  supervisor is  frozen,  down,  or  has  a  very  high  DF
                  (drowsiness   factor)-   5  minutes  or  more  -  get  an
                  explanation from the controller that you  are  relieving.
                  Check the 'time' on all supervisors.

              D.  Review the  logbook.   Check  all  information  from  the
                  previous  2  shifts.   If  you are returning from several
                  days off, review the logs beginning with the  last  shift

                                                    PAGE  43



                  that  you  worked.  Take special note of all engineers in
                  the field and  their  correct  contact  information.   Be
                  aware  of  any  chronic  problems  which have taken place
                  since your last shift.  

              E.  Check the project clipboard for projects  you  have  been
                  assigned,  as  well as those which have been carried over
                  from  the  previous   shift.    Research   your   project
                  responsibilities.

              F.  Check the  OnTyme  message  clipboard.   Read  and  sign.
                  Check  the  OnTyme  message  terminal for recent incoming
                  mail.



          II.
              A.  Log all outages as outlined in the outage procedures.

              B.  Update the daily summary and the node  escalation  report
                  as required.

              C.  Check status on any maintenance or Telco  problems  which
                  have been outstanding.

              D.   Sleep the Supervisor at 1100 GMT (Zulu).  Log into PROBE
                    and execute the following commands:

                1.  LSHUT (On both the old and new Supervisors)
                2.  EXC
                3.  Do an 'AN' (all node) command before and after the Supe
                    is slept.
                4.  Do a 'Count' command on  the  sleeping  Supe  before  a
                    sleep  command issued on current Supe.  Any differences
                    must be pursued.  

              E.   Send a summary report of all projects that have taken 
                    place during the shift.



          III.  TURNOVER (Leaving)

              A.   The Turnover Summary should contain the following:


                1.  A list of nodes  that  are  out  of  the  net,  and  an
                    explanation  of  their  outage.   Include date and time
                    out, and latest status with date and time.
                2.  Include the status of scheduled  and  unscheduled  host
                    shuts.  
                3.  Include a list ofall  nodes  which  are  on  ignore  in
                    network patrol.

                                                    PAGE  44



                4.  Include any remarks concerning chronic outages.
                5.  Include the status of all five network Supervisors  and
                    how  many  nodes  are  active in the net at the time of
                    your summary.

              B.  A shift summary must be sent  out  at  the  end  of  each
                  shift,  using  the  OnTyme  electronic  mail switch.  The
                  summary should be sent 'rush' using the group  OnTyme  id
                  '* SUMMARY'.

              C.  Copies of the following must be made and filed  with  the
                  turnover sheet:

                1.  The project summary report.
                2.  Supervisor move report.

          (NODES OUT FOR OR MORE HOURS)



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the  method  of  format  used  for
                  generating the 24 hour node report.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  24 Hour Node Report - This report lists all  nodes  which
                  have been out of the net for four (4) or more consecutive
                  hours.  It also provides the recipient the time down  and
                  the last status of the outage.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Gather all node outage tickets for  nodes  out  (4)  four
                  hours or more.

              2.  Divide nodes up according to regins.

              3.  Using systems 25 or 70: Type out the current report.  The
                  file  name  is  (NET:25 or 70) ESCAL.  *If there is not a
                  file available or if you are generating this  report  for
                  the first time, log into EDITOR.

4.  Condensing the informatin listed on outage ticket, list each node with  the
date and time out.

              5.  List date and time of all pertinent informatin  according
                  to the outage ticket in a summary format.

                                                    PAGE  52



              6.  Do this until you have listed all  pertinent  information
                  concerning these node outages.

              7.  Once all available information has  been  entered,  write
                  the  file  out  to  a  file  name.  The current report is
                  written to a file named ESCAL.  This report is  sent  out
                  to the group username (*ESCALATION).

              8.  Copy and send the report.

                  A.  Run the program -R (MPL) COPY.  This will  allow  you
                      to transfer your report from one system to another.

                  B.  Run the program -R ONTYME.  This program  will  allow
                      you  to  transfer  your  report to the ONTYME system.
                      This should be done using the Netcon Ontyme name.

                  C.  Insure that you receive a  message  number  from  the
                      ONTYME  system.   24  HOUR  NODE  REPORT 24 HOUR NODE

                              NETWORK SUPERVISOR MOVES



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This document specifies the  procedure  to  be  used  for
                  moving  the  Network  Supervisor.  This procedure will be
                  defined in two different categories.  Scheduled moves and
                  unscheduled moves.


          II.  SCHEDULED MOVES

                  A scheduled Supervisor move is when  the  active  Network
                  Supervisor is put to sleep at a scheduled period of time,
                  and access to the Network is denied until another Network
                  Supervisor  is  awakened, and taken control of 75 percent
                  of the Network (75 percent of the nodes the Sup had  last
                  time active).

              1.  Prior to the actual move, make a copy of  the  ALL  NODES
                  List  (AN),  the  SHUT  TABLE  (LSHUT),  and the COUNT OF
                  MACHINES (COUNT)>

                                                    PAGE  53



              2.  On the active Supervisor, do TSLEEP, enter the  PASSWORD,
                  but do not do a carriage return at this time.

              3.  On the sleeping Supervisor,  you  are  moving  to,  do  a
                  TWAKE,  enter  the  Password,  but  do  not do a carriage
                  return.

              4.  You are now set to do the actual Supervisor move.

                  A.  Hit a carriage return on the active Supervisor.   You
                      will  get  the  time  the  Supervisor  went to sleep.
                      (024:ll:00:38)

                  B.  Ten seconds after sleeping the active supervisor, hit
                      a carriage return on the sleeping Supervisor you wish
                      to take over  the  Net.   You'll  get  the  time  the
                      Supervisor was awakened.

                      The Aupervisor takeover is complete when it  has  all
                      Tymnet  I  and  II  nodes  are  under its control and
                      nothing is in TAKEOVER failure.

                      NOTE: Takeover failure is when a node is stuck in one
                      of its takeover states.  Tymnet I nodes have five (5)
                      states.  Tymnet II has two takeover states.  

                      On the color logger, you'll get the  node  number  of
                      the node in takeover failure and which state the node
                      is currently in.  TYMNET I has states 0-3.  TYMNET II
                      has  state 0 only.  If you cannot correct the problem
                      with a retake of the upstream meighbor, notify  Field
                      Engineering (FE) of that particular regin.

              5.  After the takeover is completed, the  following  must  be
                  accomplished.

              5.  After the takeover is completed, the  following  must  be
                  accomplished.

                  A.  Do a LSTMIN on the Supervisor you have  just  put  to
                      sleep.  Get total logins.

                  B.  Type version on the active  Supervisor  and  get  the
                      version of code running PROBE, KERNEL and SUPER.

                  C.  Do an ALL NODES  (AN)  and  LIST  SHUTS  (LSHUT)  and
                      COUNT.   Compare  the  LSHUT  from the current active
                      Supervisor with the LSHUT  from  the  Supervisor  you
                      have   just   put  to  sleep.   There  should  be  no
                      difference  on  LSHUT  and  COUNT.   If  there  is  a
                      different  in  the COUNT, use the AN to determine the
                      discrepancy.

              6.  A Netcon incident report  must  be  filled  out  for  all
                  Supervisor Moves.

              7.   Log  into  System  25  and  fill  in  the  (GO   SUPMOV)
                  information.

              8.  Mail must be sent using the Ontyme system.   Mail  should
                  be  sent  to  the  group  file  **  SUPERVISOR.   NETWORK

          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the steps  taken  when  the  "Port
                  Spewing Characters" message is received.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Port Spewing Characters.  Port Spewing Characters can  be
                  defined as a condition where an asynchonous port is in an
                  open  condition  and  continuously  floods  the   Network
                  Supervisor with characters.  If this condition is allowed
                  to continue, it could possibly cause the  active  Network
                  Supervisor to crash.

                  CHARACTERS

                  Event number: 30

                  The specified async port was running  free  and  flooding
                  the supervisor with logon characters.

                  NOTE: *This network message  will  be  displayed  on  the
                  logger whenever a 'SPEWING CHARACTERS' problem occurs.

                      1.  Do a retake of  the  node  'SPEWING  CHARACTERS'.
                  This  will  cause  the  active Supervisor to take another
                  look at that particular node and hopefully reset the port
                  that is 'SPEWING CHARACTERS'.

              2.  Notify the regional Network Field  Engineer  and  see  if
                  they can go busy out that port.

              3.  If a (FE) Field Engineer cannot be reached or if the note
                  is  in  a  remote  location, try taking the node down and
                  reloading it.

              4.  If a reload does not correct your problem, DLOAD the node
                  and  leave  it down until maintenance can go to the site.

                        STANDBY NETWORK SUPERVISOR TERMINALS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The procedure defines the way the standby Supervisors are
                  utilized.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  The standby Supervisors are five  (5)  terminals  located
                  within  Network  Control.   Each  terminal will be logged
                  into one of  the  Network  Supervisors,  via  PROBE>  One
                  terminal  will  have  an  active  Supervisor,  the  other
                  terminals  will  be  logged  into  the  other  four   (4)

                                                    PAGE  58



                  Supervisors in a "ready" state.


          III.  PROCEDURE

1.  The standby Network Supervisor terminals should be the first  item  checked
when starting turnover.  Each should be logged in via PROBE into Hosts 121,
122, 123, 124 and 125.  The username will be "standby".   There  are  three
primary  phone  numbers  used  for accessing the Network, these numbers are
located on the side of the Supervisor 1 standby terminal.

              2.  Checking the standby terminals, you  should  verify  that
                  the  terminal  is logged into the correct Host.  Check to
                  see that the terminal has a sufficient amount  of  paper.
                  Check  and  verify  the "TIME", the (DF) Drowiness Factor
                  and the state of the standby supervisor.

                                                    PAGE  59



If a Supervisor is found to have a (DF) Drowiness  factor  other  than  (0)
zero,  and/or  in a state other than Active or Sleeping, should be noted in
the Network Control logbook.  Check wih the offgoing shift for the  current
status  on  these  Supervisors.   Also,  a  Network Control Incident ticket
should be open until the problem is resolved.

              3.   A  "LOG  S"  command  will  be  issued  on  all  standby
                  Supervisors.   This  will  give us a logger by seconds on
                  the Active Supervisor.   On  the  other  Supervisors,  we
                  should  get the last time that particular Supervisor went
                  to sleep, whether by command or otherwise.  Each terminal
                  should  be  set  to  run  on  hardcopy, except the Active
                  Supervisor.  The purpose of the hardcopy  is  to  give  a
                  record of takeover, should the active Supervisor fail and
                  a standby Supervisor automatically starts taking over the
                  Net.

              4.  If there is a problem with one of the terminals used  for
                  accessing   the  standby  Supervisors,  another  terminal
                  within Network Control will be designated  as  a  standby
                  terminal until the regular terminal is repaired.

              5.  Each standby terminal should be checked  at  least  three
                  (3) times during each shift, not including turnover.

              6.  Problem with the standby Supervisors and terminals should
                  be reported to the appropriate people.

                  A.   Being  unable  to  log  into  a   sleeping   standby
                      Supervisor  should  be  reported  to  the  Manager of
                      Network Control or designate, Carl  Holmberg  or  Ken
                      Ballard.

                  B.  Ring No Answer (RNA) on our access numbers, should be
                      reported to Western Network Field Engineering (WNFE).

                  C.  Terminal problems will be reported to Hewlitt-Packard
                      for  repair.   Any other problems will be reported to
                      the shift  Supervisor.   STANDBY  NETWORK  SUPERVISOR

          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the process  by  which  an  Ontyme
                  message may be sent out via Tymnet's Network.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Ontyme  -  Tymnet's  electronic  mail  message  switching
                  service.   This  service  allows  messages to be sent and
                  received on terminals.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  The considerations and procedures used to send out Ontyme
                  messages  are  detailed  in the Ontyme Elementary Manual.
                  The current release of the manual will be contained in  a
                  binder   located   in   Network  Control  marked  "Ontyme
                  Elementary Manual".

                  When sending out Ontymes, a Network Controller  will  log
                  in  to  the  system and always specify the date, time and
                  who is to receive the message.  The text should be  clear
                  and  direct.   It should be constructed in a professional
                  manner.  The Ontyme should be  signed  with  your  Ontyme
                  user name.  See Example (1).

                  Any time you use the Netcon  user  name,  you  must  copy
                  Netcon  on  the  Ontyme  message.   When  building files,
                  private or public, use the "Ontyme Elementary Manual" for
                  a reference guide.

                  When sending an Ontyme  to  more  than  one  person,  you
                  should use the star files previouslyy created.  This is a
                  list of the files with an example of when to use them:


                      FILE USE

                      *Esculation To send out esculation reports  *projects
                      To  send  out  project  summary  *Summary To send out
                      shift summary *Trouble  To  send  out  informatin  to
                      maintenance regions *FYI To copy all Netcon personnel
                      **Supervisor To send out supervisor information


                  These files should be added to the bottom of a file build
                  in  editor.   You then should run the program Ontyme - (R
                  Ontyme).  ONTYME MESSAGES ONTYME MESSAGES

                                       DUMPS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the process by which a Dump may be
                  performed and how to perform a variety of dumps.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Dumps Node/slot - This is a release of all software in  a
                  node/slot to be stored for examination at a later date.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  Dumps should be performed on all nodes that drop  out  of
                  the  network.   This  is  accomplished by a program named
                  Load II.

              1.  Each dump should have its own file name.  The  file  name
                  will start with the node name and end with DMP.

2.  If you are unsure if there is a previous dump file on a particular node,  a
directory (DIR) should be performed on 'NDxxxx.*'.

                                                    PAGE  63



              3.  If there is a previous dump file (ND267l.DMP),  the  next
                  file  should  be  numbered (i.e.  ND267l.DP1, ND267l.DP2,
                  ND2671.DP3, etc.).  If you name the file the  same  as  a
                  previous  one,  all previous information will be cleared.
                  The new information would be  written  in  place  of  the
                  previous information.

NOTE: At no time should a dump be dumped  into  any  other  directory  then
Netcon's.

                  NOTE: Only a 'C' dump should be performed  on  all  nodes
                  that  are  available  to perform a 'C' dump.  See example
                  (1).  This dumps only the crash table of a node, occupies
                  minimal  disc  storage  and  utilizes a minimum of c.p.u.
                  time.

                                                    PAGE  64



              1.  If the node is not able to be dumped through a 'C'  dump,
                  a  'D' dump should be performed.  A 'D' dump dumps all of
                  the software memory in a node.  See example (2).

              2.  When dumping a varian machine, you must specify a  FINISH
                  address  in  octal (base 8).  This will vary according to
                  the size of memory in each node.  The  address  for  each
                  memory size is listed below:

C.  Slot dumps are performed only at the request  of  a  technical  support
person.   These are not performed on all host outages.  This will only dump
a slot on an ISIS node.  See example (3).  This is the V function  in  Load

          Within  Diagnostic  Functions  Menu,  there  exists  a   Specific
          Interface Test (Letter B):


              1.  Do this test for  the  MASTER  Modem,  check  levels  and
                  status  on  both  pages  of  output  using  the F2 key to
                  advance to the next page.

              2.  Do this test once again for the SLAVE Moden and check the
                  levels and status.


          *NOTE: Check Appendix for an example of Specific  Interface  Test
          results.

                      PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW AFTER TEST RESULTS



I.  If you receive a question mark (?)  in  the  Drop  and/or  Line  Field,  it
indicates  a  data entry error or a certain location has yet to be added to
the Analysis System.


              II.  If you receive Specific Interface Test results:

                  A.  Check both  pages  for  any  alarms  which  may  have
                      occurred.

                  B.  For receive signal level only - the  value  shown  on
                      the  table  is  -3DB off from the actual count due to
                      the  Analysis  System  (example:  -28DB   should   be
                      reported  to  Telco  as -25DB, and so forth).  Levels
                      from -10DB to -24DB are alright.

                  C.   Phase  jitter  and  signal/noise  ratio  should   be
                      interpreted  as  they are shown on the screen.  NOTE:
                      Signal/noise alarm parameters are set based upon line
                      conditioning.


III.  If you receive a Transmission Failure:

                  A.   Verify  the  PVC  is  working  properly   for   that
                      particular line.

                      Within the Diagnostic  Functions  Menu,  there  is  a
                      Control   Test Menu (Letter C), do the following test                               _
                      from that Menu.

                  B.  'A' Initialize  Remote  Diagnostic  Board  on  MASTER
                      Modem.

                  C.  'A' Initialize RD Board on SLAVE Modem.

                      If both  the  MASTER  and  SLAVE  Modems  fail,  call
                      Maintenance.   If  either  one or both pass, continue
                      on.

                  D.  'E' Self-test remote diagnosis of the  MASTER  modem.
                      If this test fails, have the field engineer check the
                      RD board in the MASTER Modem.  Proceed to do steps BD                                                                          _
                      once again.

                      If  the  test  is  correct,  however,  the  test   to
                      initialize the RD Board, as in Step B fails, have the
                      Field Engineer check strapping on the  RD  Board  and
                      proceed with Steps BD again.                                          _

                  E.  'F' Self-test MASTER  Modem.   If  this  test  fails,
                      check  Interface  (INTF)  Board strapping or replace,
                      then check RD Board strapping or replace.

                      NOTE: Test test interferes with System  operatin  for
                      up  to ten (10) seconds.  Operator should insure that
                      said interference can be tolerated before  initiating
                      the test.

                  F.  'E' Self-test remote diagnosis of  the  SLAVE  Modem.

          I.  TURN OVER - ON COMING

              A.  TERMINALS.  Check all Sup terminals,  56KB  Line  monitor
                  and  consolidator to insure that they are properly logged
                  in.  Check Telex for any international problems.

              B.  INFORMATION.  Check  the  previous  two  shift  log  book
                  entries  for any information in which swing shift will be
                  performing for that specific day.  The Ontyme  Book  must
                  also be checked to ensure that any special instruction(s)
                  sent through Ontyme will be  handled  accordingly.   Read
                  and  initial  all  previous  shift  entries  and  network
                  control mail.

              C.  Check the current status of all  Ontyme,  Outdialers  and
                  acct.  blks.  and post to verify on the swing shift entry
                  in the log book, on a daily basis.

              D.  Check the Day Shift turnover against all current outages,
                  hosts,  lines  and  nodes  to  be  sure that they are all
                  properly covered.

              E.  Check the shut table against the Day  Shift  Summary  and
                  Log  book,  all  shuts  for which there is no explanation
                  should be removed before accepting turnover.

              F.  Check all incomplete projects and their current statuses.
                  Clear  all  discrepancies  which can be alleviated before
                  project implementation group leaves.

                      G.  Get any pertinent information concerning  chronic
                  outages,  supervisor  malfunctions  if any, and any other
                  information pertaining to the operation of the net.


          II.  TURNOVER - OFF GOING

              A.  Check to verify all  standby  sup  terminals,  56KB  Line
                  Monitor and Consolidator are all properly logged in.

              B.  All telex and pertinent international abnormalities  will
                  be annotated in the log book.  If problem not resolved, a
                  verbal  analysis  of  the  call  will  be  conveyed  with
                  detailed information to both the on-coming supervisor and
                  pilot  controller,  concerning  nature  of  problem,  all
                  technical    and    maintenance   groups   notified,   if
                  international record carriers (IRCS)  involved  know  the
                  person's name or initials last working with you.

              C.  Swing Shift Summary Report -  An  end  of  shift  summary
                  consisting  of  all public network outages, nodes, hosts,
                  one hour prior to end of shift with last date and time of
                  status, must be sent to (*summary) via Ontyme.  This will
                  also include all  network  shuts,  dates  and  times  and
                  consist  discription  of  reason.  Report should conclude
                  with identifying active  supervisor  and  status  of  all
                  other  Sups, Tstat, acct.  blks: and names of all network
                  control swing shift personnel worked that day.

              D.  Outages - all public network  outages  nodes,  hosts  and
                  line  should be on their clip board in numerical order as
                  they appear on TMCS.  All outages should be annotated  at
                  a   minimum  of  two  hour  intervals  unless  documented
                  otherwise.  Outages with priority status will  be  labled
                  as   such,  and  verbally  expressed  to  both  on-coming
                  controller and supervisor as well as documented in detail
                  on the outage ticket.

              E.  Log Book - is a reference to record all  abnormal  events
                  within  the  network.   Special requests, private network
                  outages  or  malfunctions,  all   pertinent   information
                  regarding the monitoring of the network.

                                 SUPERVISOR CRASHES



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the process  by  which  a  Network
                  Supervisor crash is handled.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Supervisor Crash.  A Supervisor Crash can be  defined  as
                  anytime  a Supervisor leaves the Network from a mode or a
                  Supervisor code crash.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              A.  ACTIVE SUPERVISOR CRASH.  When a Network  Controller  has
                  determined  that the active Network Supervisor has failed
                  or crashed, they should take the following steps:

                  1.  Check to see if the standby terminals are  logged  in
                  and  operational  If  they are, please awaken the Back-up
                  Supervisor if no Sup has started takeover.

                  2.  After gaining control of the Network,  log  into  the
                  Supervisor that has crashed, if possible.  Run a log back
                  using the command in PROBE (:LOG 5LS)  to  determine  the
                  nature of the crash.  This command will give you the last
                  5 lines from the Supervisor prior to it crashing.

                  3.  If it can be determined what caused the  crash,  then
                  notify  the  appropriate  group.   Hardware  problems are
                  handled by  the  field  engineering  group  and  software
                  related  problems  should  be reported to Carl Holmberg's
                  group.  Note: Carl Holmberg and members of his group  are
                  not  to  be called after midnight, unless we're unable to
                  get a running Supervisor.  All  other  problems  will  be
                  reported to Carl/alternate the next morning.

                  4.  The  following  task  must  be  performed  after  the
                  Supervisor change has been completed:

                  a.  fill out a Netcon Incident Report.  b.  Fill out  (Go
                  SUPMOV)  on System 25.  c.  Do an All Nodes (AN).  d.  Do
                  a listing of the shuts (LSHUT).  e.  Send  an  Ontyme  to
                  the  group  file  **  SUPERVISOR.   f.  Fill out Sup move
                  form.  g.  Fill out Sup move log.  h.  Make copies of the
                  Sup move form.  One copy goes to Network Control manager,
                  one copy goes with the shift turnover, the original  copy
                  is placed in the Sup move book.

              B.  INACTIVE SUPERVISOR CRASH.  An inactive Supervisor  crash
                  is  handled  in the same fashion as an Active Supervisor,
                  only you do not have to awaken another supervisor.

Network Operations is now responsible  for  publishing  STATISTICS  on  the
operation  of the supervisor.  In order to accomplish this successfully, it
will be necessary for us to improve  the  quality  of  information  on  our
supervisor  incident  reports.   With  this  in  mind, please implement the
following policies with regard to the reporting of Supervisor problems:

          1.  A supervisor incident report should be completed anytime  the
          supervisor is moved.

          2.  A supervisor incident report should be completed anytime  the
          active  supervisor  fails  to  process log ins for two minutes or
          more.

          3.  Each supervisor incident report should be  completed  in  its
          entirety with as much information as possible.

          4.  A supervisor incident report should be completed anytime peak
          log in times exceed 20 seconds and average log in times exceed l0
          seconds for a duratin of 3 minutes or more.

          5.  Any crashes of a supervisor machine should be  logged.   This
          includes  crashes  or  inactive supervisors as well as the active
          supervisor.  .page

          I.  PURPOSE

                  The procedure provides orderly restoration of the Network
                  Supervisor in the event of a Supervisor Failure.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Supervisor Failure.  A Supervisor failure can be  defined
                  as,  anytime  a  Supervisor  leaves  the  Network and the
                  standby Supervisors fail to take control of the Network.



          III.  PROCEDURE

                  When a Network Controller has determined that the Network
                  Supervisor  has  failed,  they  should take the following
                  steps:

              1.  Contact (as time permits): A.  Manager of Network Control
                  B.  C.  D.  Don Murtaugh 2l5-265-8170 home 2l5-265-9098

              2.  Check to see if the standby terminals are logged  in  and
                  operational.   If  stats  indicate  that  more  than  one
                  Supervisor is active, sleep any Sup  which  is:  -active,
                  but  known to be an unacceptable Sup (as specified by the
                  shift supervisor); -is higher in number  than  any  other
                  Sup which is awake.

                  front of the Sup machines who can see the  front  of  the
                  machines and talk to you at the same time.

              4.  Then ask them to positively identify  the  Sup's  number.
                  Then  ask them to tell you what number is being displayed

                                                    PAGE  81



                  in the right most position on  the  Sup's  display.   The
                  following   displays   are  possible:  -Digit  alternates
                  between 01.   Sup  inactive,  recovering  from  a  crash.                           _
                  -Digit  alternates  between  02  on  node code side.  Sup                                                _
                  inactive, probably does not have  working  supervisor  or
                  Kernel  software.   -Digit  alternates  between  03.  Sup                                                                    _
                  inactive,  frozen,  off  run  queve.   -Digit  alternates
                  between  04.  Sup inactive and sleeping, go to 7.  -Digit                            _
                  alternates between  05.   Sup  active.   Go  to  step  5.                                       _
                  -Digit  does  not  alternate.  The Supervisor node ode is
                  looping or halted.

              5.  If more than one  Sup  active  (05),  the  Sup  with  the                                                   _
                  highest  number  should  be powered down.  Power down the
                  Sup cope side which  is  displaying  AC000002.   This  is
                  accomplished  by  turning  off the machine with the keyed
                  power switch located on the left  side  of  the  console.
                  Restore power to the machine after 3 minutes.

              6.  Continue to monitor the Sups.  -Do nothing if  you  can't
                  talk  via probe to an acceptable backup Sup.  If there is
                  no active Sup after 10 minutes, go to Step 7.  -Awaken an
                  acceptable backup via the TWAKE command.  Go to Step 9.

              7.  If there is still no active Sup after  10  minutes,  turn
                  the  key "on" at both engines and then simultaneously hit
                  "INI" for the lowest numbered acceptable Sup.

              8.  If there is no active Sup after 10  minutes,  repeat  the
                  procedure  in  Step  7  on  the  next  higher Sup number.
                  Repeat this procedure every l2 minutes until you run  out
                  of Sups.  When you run out of Sups, go to the donut wheel
                  and buy 2 dozen donuts.  Bring them back for your  fellow
                  operations  personnel to eat while they scan the want ads
                  for job openings.

              9.  Monitor takeover.  If it looks good and you can  log  in,
                  congrats! If it doesn't, go back to Step 8.
