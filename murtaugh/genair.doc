          INTRODUCTION


                  This manual is provided to give a  Network  specialist  a
                  check   list   approach   to   network   operations   and
                  trouble-shooting.  Many of the steps are designed  around
                  'ODDS'.   We  have  started  off the diagnostic processes
                  testing the easiest component first in an area that fails
                  more  often.   These  guidelines are not meant to replace
                  common sense  trouble-shooting  or  technical  knowledge.
                  Knowledge  of  each  network  diagnostic is a criteria in
                  itself.


                  These guidelines are meant to follow two philosophies:

                      1.  The 'KIS' method (Keep It Simple)
                      2.  You can not legislate against stupidity

          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the process by  which  TMCS,  XRAY
                  and  PROBE  are  used by Network Specialists.  A detailed
                  description of TMCS, XRAY and PROBE  and  their  uses  is
                  documented   in  their  appropriate  manuals  located  on
                  Tymnet's System (NETDVDOC:33).  
                  (NETDVDOC:33) PROBE.DOC
                  (NETDVDOC:33) TMCS.DOC
                  (NETDVDOC:33) XRAY.DOC


          II.  DEFINITION

           NOTE: This procedure contains specific user names.  These  names
                  are included as examples only.

              1.  PROBE: PROBE is a utility package  that  resides  on  all
                  Network  Supervisors.   It allows you to query all of the
                  Network nodes, lines and host interfaces and control some
                  supervisor functions.

              2.  TMCS: The Tymnet monitoring and control  system  (Product
                  Title)  is an inter-active system which provides multiple
                  users with selective access to the status of  the  Tymnet
                  Technology Network.

              3.  XRAY: XRAY is an  interactive  monitoring  and  debugging
                  system  that provides a real-time window into a Tymnet II
                  node.  Through it,  the  user  can  conveniently  display
                  information  about  the node's configuration, performance
                  and history.  Remember, this is only the local node.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  PROBE: Network Control should have  one  terminal  logged
                  into  job  slot of each supervisor at all times.  One (1)
                  should be logged  into  the  active  Supervisor  and  the
                  others should be logged into our standby supervisors.

                  A.  The username "NETCON" will only be used by the  pilot
                      of  the  Network.   All other PROBE terminals will be
                      logged in  using  the  username  of  the  specialist.
                      Remember,  there  should  never  be two (2) "NETCONS"
                      logged into PROBE at the same time.

                  B.  The standby terminals after being logged into  PROBE,
                      and  the  printer  turned  on,  should have a "LOG S"
                      command issued.  This command serves two purposes:

                      1.  It starts a  logger  by  seconds  on  the  active
                          Supervisor.

                      2.  It will give  you  the  last  time  the  inactive
                          Supervisor went to sleep and also, if the Sup had
                          taken a crash, the time the crash occurred.   The
                          inactive  Supervisor paper log is also set to run
                          in  this  mode,  should  one  of   the   inactive
                          Supervisors start a Takeover.

                  C.  The tasks that are most often  performed  by  Network
                      Control using PROBE:

                      1.  Snapping nodes, hosts and lines
                      2.  Shutting/clearing lines
                      3.  All nodes list
                      4.  Sleeping/waking Supervisors
                      5.  RNODE
                      6.  SYNPORT
                      7.  DLOAD
                      8.  Exceptions List (EXC)
                      9.  TSTAT
                     10.  BORI and T2BORI
                     11.  Change Neighbors
                     12.  LSTMIN
                     13.  PERDAT

              2.  TMCS.  At the beginning of each  shift,  all  Specialists
                  are  required  to  make  sure  the  required terminals in
                  Network  Control  are  logged  into  TMCS   and   running
                  properly.

UTILITY PROGRAMS


                  A.  The required programs used within Network Control:

          PROGRAM            USERNAME               USE

          HOST               NETCON3         MONITOR 24 HOUR HOSTS
          COLORNODE          COLORNODE       MONITOR PUBLIC NODES  HOSTS                                                                  _
          COLORLINE          COLORLINE       MONITOR LINES
          COLORINFO          COLORINFO       NETWORK LOGIN INFORMATION
          LOG                NETCON/NETCON 2 RUN A NETWORK LOG
          DISPLAY            NETCON/NETCON 2 DISPLAY ALL NETWORK OUTAGES
          GATEWAYS           GATEWAY         MONITOR PRIVATE NET GATEWAYS

              3.  XRAY: XRAY provides a real-time window into a  Tymnet  II
                  node.   Through  it,  the  user  can conveniently display
                  information about the node's  configuration,  performance
                  and  history.   XRAY  also  has  commands  to monitor the
                  status of a node's  links,  trace  activity  and  isolate
                  problems in the node.  Last (and perhaps least) XRAY is a
                  debugging tool for programmers who can use it to diagnose
                  nodecode and network bugs.

                  A.  Network control uses what is known as "REMOTE  XRAY".
                      Remote  access is gained by remotely logging into the
                      kernel host of a node that is up in the network.

                  B.  "ND" - Node Descriptor.  This is the primary  command
                      used  within  Network Control.  This command lets the
                      controller find out more, in less time, about a  node
                      configuration  and current status in the node than he
                      could through any  number  of  PROBE,  TMCS  and  DDT
                      (De-bugger) commands.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                                  HEALTH OF A NODE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure outlines methods of obtaining  information
                  relative  to a node's general health without interrupting
                  users of that node.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  XRAY access to the target node.
                  2.  Access to an unused slot within ISIS nodes.
                  3.  Access to LOADII or ELF IF the target node is an ISIS
                      machine.
                  4.  Access to the file: SLCRSH.NIB if the  target  is  an
                      ISIS node.


          III.  PROCEDURES

              I.  To determine fundamental condition of the node:

                  1.  Log into XRAY in the target node.

                  2.  In response to the XRAY prompt type: ND

                  3.  Observe the XRAY output and note the following:

                      a.  Elapsed time since "NODE FIRST CAME UP"

                      (This is time since node was last loaded with code.)

                      b.  Elapsed time since "NODE LAST CAME UP"

                      (This is  time  since  node  last  recovered  from  a
                       crash.)

                      c.  The crash COUNT, TYPE and ADDRESS.

                      d.  The STATUS of the lines.

NODE HEALTH


                      e.  The ERRATE of the lines.

                      f.   The  TIILNK  NEIGHBORS  DOWN  list.   These  are
                          neighbors  which  were specified for this node in
                          its TYM file but which have not communicated with
                          the  target  node  since  it was last loaded with
                          code.

                  4.  At the XRAY prompt type: CL xx .

                      a.  THE QUALITY XX WILL BE THE  NUMBER  OF  THE  MOST
                          RECENT  CRYPTO  LOGGER messages you wish to view.
                          (XRAY expects xx to be entered in HEX.  A maximum
                          of  256 (DECIMAL), ie.  FF (HEX), messages can be
                          displayed.)

                      b.   Observe  the  XRAY  crypto  logger  output   for
                          indications  of kernel overloads, line anomalies,
                          slot reports, etc.

                  5.  Again at the XRAY prompt type: NS

                      a.  Observe the EXCT (Executive  Loop  Count)  value.
                          It should be greater than 40 on a properly loaded
                          node.

                      b.   Observe  the  EXLW  value.   (This   is   lowest
                          Executive   Loop   Count   which   the  node  has
                          experienced since the values were last reset.)

                      c.  Observe the EXWH value.  (This  is  the  greatest
                          Executive   Loop  Count  which  the  machine  has
                          experienced since the values were last reset.)

                          NOTE: The EXCT, EXLW and EXWH counts can be reset
                                 by  typing:  NS  Z IN response to the XRAY
                                 prompt.   This  will  allow  the  user  to
                                 observe   Executive  Loop  Count  behavior
                                 during specific time frames

                      d.  Observe the TOTAL value for CODE DELAY and H-WARE
                          DELAY.  The value should be less than 50.

                  6.  At the XRAY prompt type: KS xxxx (where  xxxx  =  the
                      node number of a neighbor).

                      a.  Observe the PACKET OVERHEAD values  but  remember
                          that  overhead  is inversely proportional to data
                          traffic.  The overhead remains roughly fixed  and
                          if   there  is  little  data  on  the  line,  the
                          percentage of overhead will be driven up.

                      b.  Observe the BANDWIDTH utilization.  It should  be
                          less than 60% and not greater than 70%.

                      c.  Observe the TOTAL for LINK DELAY.  It  should  be
                          less than 50 ms.

                      d.  Observe the OVERLOAD COUNT.  This is  the  number
                          of  times the RMAKE routine could not service all
                          channels with data within 500 ms.  A threshold of
                          10/min exists for this measurement.

                      e.  Observe the SATURATION COUNT.  This indicated the
                          number of times the link was never idle for a 1/2
                          second period.  A threshold of 30/min exists  for
                          this measurement.

                      f.  Observe the BACKLOG COUNT.  This is the number of
                          times  the  RMAKE routine could not make a packet
                          due to a closed window.

                          NOTE:  The KS command should be exercised on
                                  every active neighbor.

              II.  To obtain CRASH TABLE information from  a  running  ISIS
                  node:

                  1.  Using LOADII or ELF load SLCRSH.NIB  into  an  unused
                      slot in the target node.

                  2.  Log into DDT in the target node.

                  3.  Enter the slot just loaded with SLCRSH.NIB.

                  4.  Run SLCRSH by typing ?STAT at the DDT prompt.

                  5.  SLCRSH will return information relative to the  node,
                      the  node  type, version of code, crash count and the
                      time the node was last taken over by the  supervisor.
                      It  will  also  display  the SUMMARY CRASH TABLE, the
                      DETAIL CRASH TABLES, REGISTER SET 0 and  F  contents,
                      MAC Status and Segmentation Register contents.


               COMMENTS:

                  With reasonable care being used while working in DDT, the
                  procedures outlined above will not be disruptive to users
                  of the node.

                                HEALTH OF ISIS SLOT



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure will  outline  some  of  the  more  common
                  methods  which  can  be utilized to ascertain the general
                  health of an ISIS slot.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. DDT access to the node containing the target slot.
                  2. XRAY access to the node containing the target slot.
                  3. Access to a loading facility, LOADII or ELF.
                  4. Access to the program CRASH.


          III.  PROCEDURES

              I.  To determine if the target slot is RUNNING:

                  1.  Log into DDT in the target node.

                  2.  Enter the target slot.

                          (If the slot is  halted,  you  should  receiv
                           "SLOT   HALTED"   message.    However,   further
                           verification of slot operation according to  the
                           following steps is recommended.)

                  3.  At the DDT prompt type: ?CPU

                  4.  Observe the response.  If the  quantities  for  "RATE
                      USER"  and  "RATE  SYSTEM" are greater than zero (0),
                      the slot is running.

                  5.  Further verification that the slot is running can  be
                      obtained by typing: ?HISTORY .

                  6.  Observe  the  "Comments"  column.   If  the  slot  is
                      running,  the most recent history for the target slot
                      will indicate "STARTED" and then "RESTARTED".

                                                    PAGE  12
ISIS SLOT HEALTH


                  7.  If a SYS UPTIME message is observed in the "Comments"
                      column, it indicates that no slot halts have occurred
                      since a reload.


              II.  To determine the date and time the slot was last HALTED:

                  1.  Log into DDT in the target node.

                  2.  Enter the target slot.

                  3.  In response to the DDT prompt, type: ?HISTORY .

                  4.  Observe the "Comment" column.   "HALTED  BY  COMMAND"
                      indicates  that  the  slot  was  manually halted with
                      DDT's "H" command.  "HALTED" indicates that the  slot
                      crashed.

                  5.  Observe the right most column  for  the  most  recent
                      indication  that  the slot was HALTED.  The left most
                      column will indicate the time lapse  since  the  slot
                      halt.   The  elapsed  time will be displayed in days,
                      hours, minutes and seconds or if the elapsed time was
                      less  than  one  day,  the  time will be displayed in
                      hours, minutes and seconds.

                  6.  The date and time of the most  recent  slot  stoppage
                      can  then  be  calculated  using the current date and
                      time and the elapsed time.


              III.  To recover a slot's CRASH TABLE:

                  1.  Run the program CRASH.

                  2.  If you have to pass through a gateway  to  reach  the
                      target  node,  type  a  "G" in response to the "ENTER
                      KERNEL HOST NUMBER" prompt.

                  3.  Respond to the remaining CRASH  program  prompts  and
                      CRASH  will  print  out  the  slot's  host  info, the
                      versions of code in the ISIS  kernel  and  the  slot,
                      identification  of  the slot type, information on the
                      last crash and finally the slot's crash table.

                      NOTE: The CRASH program  is  an  automated  means  of
                            observing a slot's Crash Table information.

               COMMENTS:

                  If the user exercises sufficient care while in DDT,  none
                  of  the  procedures specified above will be disruptive to
                  users of the target node.

                           REMOVING USERS FROM ISIS SLOTS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure allows a user to clear another user from a
                  specified slot.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  License to access slot

                        A.  L.SOA - License to log into slot 0
                        B.  L.SYA - License to log into slot 0FF (The  ISIS
                            System)
                        C.  L.E.  - Normal Execution  Access  (Permits  the
                            starting and halting of a slot) 

                  2.  DDT access to node


          III.  PROCEDURE 

              1.  Log into DDT in the target node.  

              2.  Type in a slot number other than the number of  the  slot
                  to  be cleared.  When the "*" prompt appears, the user is
                  connected to the slot.

              3.  Type "?WHO".  DDT outputs a  table  showing  the  current
                  status  of  each  slot.  The * to the right of the slot #
                  shows that you are the active user in that slot.   The  @
                  to  the right of the slot # shows the active users in the
                  other slots.

              4.  Type in "?PORT".  Lists the users  and  the  kernel  port
                  numbers assigned to them.

              5.  Type in "?HANG XX".  With "XX" being the port  number  of
                  the user removed.

              6.  Type "?WHO".  To verify slot is now cleared  of  the  "@"
                  indicator.   The username will remain.  Now slot is clear

                              ISIS: MEMORY ALLOCATIONS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure describes the process for determining  the
                  memory  allocations  made to the various slots in an ISIS
                  node.  This procedure is applicable  to  those  instances
                  where  dumps  of  the code from lowest memory through the
                  entirety  of  some  specific  slot  is   required.    For
                  instance,  dumps  are  often  required  starting with low
                  memory and including the entirety of SLOT 0.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

              1.  Access to the BND file for the node on which  the  memory
                  allocations are to be determined.

              2.  Access to the utility program MERLIN.


          III.  PROCEDURE 

              1.  Log into a system where MERLIN and the  node's  BND  file
                  are accessible or can be made accessible.

              2.  At the executive prompt, type: R MERLIN

              3.  At MERLIN's prompt, type: RUN

              4.  In response to MERLIN's "ENTER KERNEL FILE NAME"  prompt,
                  type the file name for the BND file.

              5.  In response to MERLIN's "SLOT x PRESENT OPTION:"  or  the
                  "SLOT xx NOT PRESENT OPTION" prompts, type: /N

              6.  Repeat STEP 5 until the prompts cease and the SLOT MAP is
                  printed.  The SLOT MAP will have the form:

                                      SLOT MAP

                  SLOT BEGINS ENDS

              7.  MERLIN will then return to the system's executive prompt.


               COMMENT:

                  This process is useful for determining if  memory  errors
                  at  some  specific  locations  fall within a slot that is
                  experiencing distress.

                         MOVING LOGICAL UNITS IN ISIS SLOTS



          I.  PURPOSE 

                  This procedure allows a  user  to  move  a  logical  unit
                  within an ISIS slot and from one slot to another.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access DDT in target node.
                  2. "SYS" license in DDT required to move L.U.
                  3. Knowledge of TYM files.


          III.  SCOPE

                  The ability to move logical units  enhances  our  trouble
                  shooting  needs.   The  specialist  can move a L.U.  to a
                  spare  slot  and  load  an  inactive  and   online   slot
                  diagnostic.

          IV.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Check the TYM file for the Logical Unit (L.U.) that is to
                  be moved.

              2.  Log into DDT in the target node.  

              3.  At the "slot#" prompt, put in  the  number  of  the  slot
                  currently assigned to L.U.  that is to be moved.

              4.  Once the "*" prompt is displayed the user is connected to
                  the slot.

              5.  Type: ?LU.  This  will  display  all  the  logical  units
                  assigned  to  the slot and hardware referenced to each in
                  the TYM file.

              6.  Type in ?TRAN.

              7.  At the "Source L.U." prompt, type in the  number  of  the
                  logical unit to be moved.

MOVE LOGICAL UNITS


              8.  At the "Destination slot" prompt, type in the  number  of
                  the slot to which the L.U.  is being moved.

              9.  At the "Destination L.U." prompt, type in the  number  of
                  the slot to which the L.U.  is to be moved.

                  (All responses are expected in hexadecimal)

                  (The source and destination slot can be the same)

             10.  At  the  *  prompt,  issue  the  ^  (up  arrow)  and  the
                  destination slot number that L.U.  was moved to.

             11.  Type ?LU to verify that the L.U.  was moved and  that  it
                  has the correct number.


               WARNING:

                  In some interfaces, when transferring the L.U.   back  to
                  the  source  slot,  the  slot  will  halt.   It  will  be
                  necessary to restart it using the "E" command (EXECUTE).

                                LOADING FILES TO ELF



          I.  PURPOSE

                  ELF is used to generate a binary image of code on a  disk
                  or  tape  and  load  that  image  into a engine through a
                  network.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  The purchase of the ELF software  and  all  necessary
                      hardware relative to its operation.
                  2.  Access to ELF document.
                  3.  Access to mainframe host computers  that  stores  the
                      production code of the network.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              I.  To Set Up ELF for Gateway Access:

                  1.  Log into ELF with the appropriate login string.
                  2.  Enter all commands at the (:) prompts.
                  3.  At the first prompt, type  "GATEWAY".   This  command
                      must  be  used  by  those  without  a TYMCOM-X system
                      running on their network, before any 'CREATE' command
                      is used.  This tells ELF that it must login through a
                      gateway before it can actually login to the  TYMCOM-X
                      to retrieve data.
                  4.  Next prompt is 'GATEWAY USERNAME HOST'.  Type in  the
                      valid username in the user's network.
                  5.  ELF will now prompt "IS THIS AN X.75 GATEWAY?"
                      (Enter 'YES' only if gateway  host  specified  is  an
                       X.75 gateway, otherwise enter 'NO'.)


              II.  To Load a Bound File onto ELF:

                  1.  At the prompt, type: "CR N" (CREATE NODE)
                  2.  ELF will prompt user with 'DEVICE UNIT ID': Enter the
                      unit ID of the device to be written on, ie.  "Do".
                  3.  User will be  prompt  'FILE  ID':  This  is  used  to

                                                    PAGE  21
ELF


                      identify  the  file on a load.  Enter the checksum of
                      the file.
                  4.  ELF will display: SHOULD FILE  BE  WRITTEN  IN  IMAGE
                      FORMAT?
                      (Type 'YES' if you intend to load the  file  via  the
                       bootstrap.)
                      (Type 'NO' if file will always be loaded through  the
                       ELF.)
                  5.  The user is prompted for the TYMCOM-X login string as
                      follows:  'TYMCOM-X  USERNAME,HOST':  The user enters
                      the username to be used to log into the  TYMCOM-X  in
                      TYMNET  where  the  load  data is stored - enter host
                      number if required.
                  6.  User is then prompted 'PASSWORD': Enter password  for
                      username  just  entered.  Password will not be echoed
                      to the terminal.
                  7.  At the 'OBJECT FILE' enter: The name of the file  you
                      wish to be transferred to ELF.
                  8.  If user is not prompted for the object file, check to
                      see if gateway command was issued.
                  9.  File will begin to transfer.
                 10.  When completed, the (:) prompt will appear again.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                       ACCESSING THROUGH GATEWAYS WITH LOADII



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure deals with the methods by which LOADII can
                  be  used  to access slots and nodes through inter-network
                  gateways.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  Access to LOADII, Version 2.16 or later.
                  2.   Access  license  to  use  LOADII  through   specific
                      gateways.
                  3.  Access to LOADII.DOC


          III.  PROCEDURE

              I.  Using LOADII Through a Single Gateway

           ...........                                         ...........
           :         :                ............             :         :
           :  HOST   :                :          :             : TARGET  :
           : Running :----------------: GATEWAY  :-------------:  NODE   :
           : LOADII  :                :..........:             :   or    :
           :         :                                         :  Slot   :
           :.........:                                         :.........:

           ^                                    ^                      ^

                  1.  Log into a host on which LOADII is available  and  at
                      the ENTER FUNCTION prompt, type G.

                  2.  Then in response to the ENTER  GATEWAY  HOST  prompt,
                      type  the  host number of the desired gateway between
                      the network in  which  LOADII  is  resident  and  the
                      netwok in which the target node or slot is resident.

                  3.  In response then to the ENTER PASSWORD  FOR  EXTERNAL
                      NET prompt, type the appropriate password.

LOADII VIA GATEWAY      


                  4.  Then continue responding to  the  LOADII  prompts  to
                      perform the desired LOADII function.

                  5.  Reference LOADII.DOC for explanations  of  any  error
                      messages which might be displayed.

              II.  Using LOADII Through Multiple Gateways

                  Provision has been  made  in  LOADII  to  build  circuits
                  through  multiple gateways to reach a target which is not
                  accessible  through  a  single  gateway.   Consider   the
                  diagram below.


               ..........                                       ..........
               :        :         .........       .........     :        :
               : HOST   :         :       :       :       :     : TARGET :
               :Running :---------:GATEWAY:-------:GATEWAY:-----:  NODE  :
               : LOADII :         :.......:       :.......:     :   or   :
               :........:                                       :  SLOT  :
                                                                :........:

               ^                         ^              ^             ^
               |<---------NETWORK------> |<---NETWORK-->|<----NETWORK--->|
               |             A           |       B      |      C      |

                  When a target node or slot in Network C must be  accessed
                  by  LOADII  which  is resident in Network A and more than
                  one gateway must be passed  to  effect  the  access,  the
                  LOADII  command  X  can  be  used  to build the necessary
                  circuit.

                  1.  Log into a host on which LOADII is available  and  at
                      the ENTER FUNCTION prompt, type X.

                  2.  In response to the ENTER GATEWAY HOST NUMBER  prompt,
                      type  the  host number of the desired gateway between
                      the network in which it is  resident  and  the  first
                      network to be accessed.

                  3.  LOADII will then prompt for  the  function  and  will
                      continue  to  prompt  for information relative to the
                      specified function until  all  necessary  information
                      has been acquired.

                  4.  At this  point  LOADII  will  display  the  following
                      messages:

                                    BUILDING CIRCUIT
                                    CIRCUIT TO GATEWAY BUILT
                                    ENTERING RELAY MODE (CTL)Z TO EXIT

LOADII VIA GATEWAY      


                  5.  The login banner for the first network  entered  will
                      now  be  displayed followed by that Network's "please
                      log in:" message.

                  6.  The LOADII user now may perform normal logins through
                      gateways to finally reach the destination network.

                      EXAMPLE:

                     inter-link established from tymnet-4534 to GHR network
                     please log in: GATEWAY:4;<password>
                     inter-link established from GHR network to LFS network
                     please log in:  (CTL)Z

                     CIRCUIT BUILT
                     THE LOAD REQUEST HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED
                     LOADING
                       40-XMT      0-RCV      0-LOST
                                    : 
                                    :

                      NOTE: The example shows the circuit being built  into
                             the  LFS network which, in the example, is the
                             location of the target node for a load.

                             Notice, that once in that network, the  (CTL)Z
                             response  was  entered to cause LOADII to exit
                             the "RELAY MODE"  and  exercise  the  function
                             that was specified earlier.

                      LOADING FILE FROM ECLECTIC LOAD FACILITY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  To load a node or slot from an ELF facility.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  ELF Facility
                  2.  ELF Facility loaded with current code slot and node.
                  3.  Access to ELF documentation.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              I.  Loading a Node

                  1.  Log into ELF with the appropriate login string.
                  2.  At the first prompt, type "LOAD NODE" (L N)
                  3.  ELF will prompt you for input device, ie.  'Do'
                  4.   ELF  will  now  determine  if  device  requested  is
                      available.   If not available, ELF will display ERROR
                      ON   DEVICE,UNIT   'UNAVAILABLE'.    If   device   is
                      available, ELF will prompt you for 'FILE ADDRESS'.
                  5.  Enter file address of the ELF  file  that  is  to  be
                      loaded.
                      (This information is found  by  doing  a  'DIRECTORY'
                       command.)
                  6.  After file address has been entered ELF will  display
                      the  object  file  that corresponds with file address
                      requested.
                  7.  ELF will ask if this is 'OKAY'.
                      If "NO" is entered, ELF will  prompt  again  for  the
                      file address.  
                      If "YES" is entered, ELF will progress  to  the  next
                      prompt.
                  8.  ELF will prompt now for the  target  node's  neighbor
                      node, its kernel host and line number.
                  9.  When the  transfer  of  node  code  begins  ELF  will
                      dsiplay  the  message  "TRANSFER STARTING".  ELF will
                      report number of records transferred.
                 10.  When transfer is complete ELF will display:  TRANSFER

LOADING FILE FROM ELF


                      COMPLETE AND NODE STARTED'.
                 11.  The (:) prompt will return when load is completed.
                 12.  Type QUIT to exit the ELF.

              II.  Loading a Slot

                  1.  Log into ELF with the appropriate login string.
                  2.  At the first prompt, type "LOAD SLOT" (L S)
                  3.  Now follow STEPs 3 through 7 in section I.
                  4.  Once "YES" is accepted, ELF will prompt for the  slot
                      number.  This is the slot that is to be loaded.
                  5.  ELF will then prompt for kernel host  number.   Enter
                      the kernel host of the node with slot to be loaded.
                  6.   ELF  will  display  "TRANSFER  STARTING"  and   "MAC
                      INITIALIZED".
                  7.  When the slot is loaded, ELF will  display  "TRANSFER
                      COMPLETE" and "SLOT STARTED".
                  8.  ELF will return to the (:) prompt when complete.
                  9.  Type QUIT to exit ELF.

                  To define the criteria of access controls  to  the  PROBE
                  job slot.


          II.  SCOPE

                  Access to `PROBE' commands  is  delegated  at  validation
                  time.   Each  user name is assigned an OCTAL value.  Each
                  bit  in  this  OCTAL  value  represents  a  character  of
                  privilege.   The  maximum  value  is  77 octal.  The bits
                  break down is as follows:

                       Cannot be hung      100 000
                       STATUS 20 commands  010 000
                       STATUS 10 commands  001 000
                       *No Timeout set     000 100
                       STATUS 2 commands   000 010
                       STATUS 1 commands   000 001

                  Classes of user access may be set up as follows:

                       Look do not touch    status  00/04
                       Specific statistics  status  20/24
                       Change topology      status  30/34
                       Control supervisor   status  31/35
                       Initialize & Control status  33/37

                * If a user's connect time to PROBE is to be checked,  turn
                  bit  4 of the low order off.  This will automatically log
                  the user off after an assembled in time frame.

                  There are two groups of user names in PROBE.   The  first
                  and  most  important  is the assembled in group.  This is
                  one or more names, password and status which is  compiled
                  into  the  PROBE software at system generation time.  YOU
                  MUST HAVE ONE ASSEMBLED IN PROBE NAME.  The second  group
                  is  Disk  resident names, passwords and status level.  To
                  bring  a  supervisor  up  from  scratch,  you  need   the
                  assembled  in  name  to  enter  at  least your first Disk

PROBE ACCESS OPERATIONS


                  resident name.  Any Disk resident name of 35  or  37  may
                  enter probe names on disk.

                  Having access to an assembled in user name for day to day
                  operation  is important.  This is to the possibility of a
                  disk failure barring any Disk resident name from  logging
                  in.   If this occurs, the only control of supervisor will
                  be through the power off switch.   PROBE  has  a  maximum
                  limit  on simultaneous users.  One slot is always held in
                  reserve for  an  assembled  in  user,  thus  guaranteeing
                  access to your Network Control personnel.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Use the `list' command to determine a free disk slot.

              2.  Type "ENTER [Job slot] [user name]  [STATUS  level]"  The
                  slot number should be used in each supervisor.

                     Example: ENTER 127 NETWORK1 37 - will give  access  to
                              the  user  name NETWORK1 with a status of 37.
                              The password will be a defaulted value.   See
                              your network administrator for the password.

              3.  To delete a user name, use the list command to  find  the
                  slot number.  Type "ENTER [slot number]"

                     Example: ENTER 127 - This will delete the name created
                              in step 2 above.

              4.   The  list  command  will  list  all  probe  names.   All
                  assembled  in  names will be preceded by "AAA".  All Disk
                  names will be preceded by a number 0 through your  system
                  generation  maximum.   Any  name having an asteric by the
                  slot number has a default password.  The owner or user of
                  that  PROBE  name should be reminded to change it or have
                  the name removed.

              5.  For assembled in names, the `PSWD' should be used to find
                  a  hex  cipher  for  a user name and password.  These two
                  values should  be  given  to  the  system  programmer  to
                  generate  into PROBE.  This is the only method of adding,
                  deleting or changing the default password of this name.

              6.  Any PROBE user name may change  the  password  using  the
                  `Password' command.

          I.  PURPOSE

                  To free a job in PROBE to allow access to it.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Must be logged into PROBE.
                  2. Must have "01" status in PROBE.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  At the PROBE prompt, type: "WHO".  This will list all the
                  users   logged   into  PROBE  with  the  left  hand  list
                  indicating the "job label".  This job label will identify
                  the user to be removed.

              2.  At the next prompt, type: "HANG 'x'" with 'x'  being  the
                  job label of the username to be removed.

          I.  SCOPE

                  To provide a consistency needed to maintain a monitor  of
                  the network.

                  TMCS = Tymnet Monitoring and Control System


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Define a person to be the data base administrator for the
                  monitoring group.

              2.  This person will need a  minimum  license  of  'UPD'  and
                  'SETN'  with  all  node  and host numbers in the profile.
                  This user name must be valid on all TMCS systems.

              3.  All additions and deletions will have to be made  on  all
                  TMCS  systems  in  order  to  maintain  consistency  with
                  systems.

              4.  The naming conventions will be as follows:

                  A) All node names for  machines  in  North  America  will
                      follow the following format:

                      XXXXXX-DT
                      Where XXXXXX is the node name
                      - is an underscore
                      D is the maintenance district
                      T is the type of application

                      Example for 'D' are:

                      A = China Basin
                      B = Boston and New England District
                      C = Chicago
                      D = Dallas
                      H = Houston
                      L = Los Angeles
                      N = New York
                      P = Philadelphia
                      S = Santa Clara
                      T = Seatle, Wash.
                      V = Denver
                      W = Washington
                      X = Phoenix

                      Example for 'T' are:

                      A = ASYNC Tymsat on an engine
                      B = Base that computer maintenance handles
                      I = Isis
                      S = Switcher
                      V = All varian data machines
                      U = Micro node
                      M = Mini Enginer

                      Example for 'XXXXXX' will bear two ways.

                      If the machine is located at  a  Tymnet  or  Tymshare
                      location,  then the name will be the city in which it
                      is located.

                      If the machine is at a customer  location,  then  the
                      name  will  be  that of the customer, even if it is a
                      Tymnet machine being housed by someone.  We only have
                      access during their work hours.

                      Upon seeing a city as the name then it  is  known  we
                      have access to site any time of the day or night.

                  B) Node names of machines out of North America will  bear
                      the name of the city in which it is located.


                  C) Host names will bear the following formats:

                      XXXXX3270 = 3270 host on Tymnet machine
                      YYYYYYX25 = X25 host on Tymnet machine
                      YYYYYYX75 = X75 host on Tymnet machine
                      XXXXXGATE = Gateway to private network
                      ASYNC     = ASYNC Tymcom slot on customer machine
                      XXXXXBISY = BISYNC Tymcom host on Tymnet machine
                      BISYNC    = BISYNC host on customer machine
                      327ONH    = 3270 Native host on customer machine
                      327OVH    = 3270 Virtual host on customer machine
                      3270VTERM = 3270 Virtual terminal interface
                      3270TERM  = 3270 Terminal interface

                  *Note: Where the host is on  a  customer  machine,  their
                  name  can be deleted from the host name as all host print
                  outs also contain  mention  of  the  machine  it  is  on.
                  Therefore, you do not need to see the name twice.


              5.  Groups found not adhereing to the policy will have  their
                  license removed.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                         TMCS: FUNCTIONING IN DISPLAY MODE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure will outline the proper method of  setting
                  up TMCS to function in the DISPLAY mode.


          II.  PROCEDURE 

              1.  Log into TMCS

              2.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS PRO

              3.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS SEL

              4.  Check the output from STEP 3 and use the  TMCS  "RESTORE"
                  and/or  "IGNORE"  commands  to establish the LIMITS which
                  will be required to obtain the DISPLAY coverage  that  is
                  required.

                  NOTE: It will be impossible to restore anything which  is
                         not  listed  in  the  output from STEP 2.  Consult
                         TMCS documentation for procedure  for  having  the
                         PROFILE changed.

              5.  Locate the terminal identifier just to the right  of  the
                  TMCS  user  name in the first line of the output obtained
                  in STEP 2.

              6.  If your terminal is not comparable to the  terminal  type
                  identified  in  STEP 5, use the TMCS "TER" command to set
                  TMCS up for your specific terminal.

                  Type: TER ? in response to the TMCS prompt  to  obtain  a
                        list of acceptable terminal types.

                  Type: TER xxxxxxx in response to the TMCS prompt  to  set
                        TMCS  up  for  the  terminal  now  in  use.  (where
                        xxxxxxx = the terminal type)

              7.  In response to the TMCS prompt, type: DISPLAY

TMCS DIS


              8.  The current NODE, HOST, LINE and LINK statuses will  then
                  appear on the terminal.

                RECONFIGURING THE TYMNET MONITOR AND CONTROL SYSTEM



          I.  PURPOSE

                  To  define  the   steps   necessary   for   the
                  Reconfiguration  of NEM to provide for recovery
                  from disk errors.


          II.  SCOPE

                  This procedure has been quite carefully  worked
                  out  over  time.   If  followed, it will insure
                  recovery in the event of a disk error.  


          III.  PROCEDURE
              (In the following file names, "####" is the  number
               of   the   node  in  which  the  relevant  NEM  is
               resident.)

              1.  Rename the ND####.NI1 to BK####.NI1.   (Do  not
                  ever write over code.)

              2.  Rename the  ND####.N01  to  BK####.N01.   (This
                  never works the first time.)

              3.  Rename the ND####.BND to  BK####.BND.   (Always
                  do this in order!)

              4.  Rename the ND####.D01 to BK####.D01.  (Old disk
                  configuration)

              5.  Rename the ND####.A01 to ND####.D01.  (This  is
                  current configuration.)

              6.  Copy the ND####.D01 to ND####.A01.  (After  the
                  copy,  make changes to the new A01 file.  Leave
                  the D01 alone.)

              7.  Log into the TMCS host  and  type  the  command
                  [ARCH  STORE  0].  This will take a copy of all
                  the node names and host name and user  profiles

TMCS RECONFIGURING


                  and  all  kinds  of related material that makes
                  TMCS work.  If there is a I/O error,  call  the
                  site  and ask them to check the tape drive.  If
                  the drive is online have them initializing  the
                  node  or  hault and execute the slot.  The code
                  sometimes  hangs  up  the   tape   drive.    By
                  initializing  the  node, the host sees the tape
                  drive again.

                  A.  Before you make  changes  to  the  new  A01
                      file, you must run TMRE.  This program will
                      make a memory estimate for the  slot.   The
                      procedure  is "R(SOURCE)TMRE".  The program
                      will prompt the user for configuration.

                  B.  Create a NI1 file by running the ND####.CI1
                      file.   This  will take about 15 minutes at
                      non-peak time or 1.5 hours  at  peak  time.
                      Each  interface  takes about 26000 TRU'S so
                      you will need a username with  a  unlimited
                      budget.   Also  the  directory will need at
                      least 10,000 pages.  After each gen, delete
                      *.TMP files.  The Pascal compiler creates a
                      lot of TMP files.

                  C.  After generating the  NI1  file  (known  as
                      'TMDM'),  the  file needs to be loaded into
                      the slot.  There are 2 procedures, first is
                      for  a  1  MEG  machine.   The  second is a
                      procedure for a multi MEG machine.

                      1.  R LOADII;SLOT,KHOST,1,ND####.NI1

                      2.  R COM;ND####.LI1  (This  is  a  command
                          file for the code to be loaded into the
                          second MEG through DDT.  The file  does
                          all the work.)

                  D.  After the slot has been loaded  with  TMDM,
                      it  will  return  to the network.  When the
                      slot comes up, you will need to login right
                      away.   The slot will only let one user in.
                      After that point, the host will show up  no
                      ports.   If  a  TMCS  user beats you to the
                      host, you will need to  log  into  DDT  and
                      hault  and execute the slot.  Then login to
                      slot right after doing this process.   This
                      problem comes from users who have PVC ports
                      set up to build circuits into TMCS.

                  E.  When you get into the TMCS host,  you  will
                      see  a heading refering to disk maintenance
                      program with some version number with a '*'

TMCS RECONFIGURING


                      for a prompt.  At this point, TMCS is ready
                      for your next command.  Your first  command
                      is 'SEE BELOW'.

                      1.  Type 'DISP CONFIG' (This  will  display
                          the   old  configuration  and  the  new
                          configuration.   Warning:   This   only
                          shows   the   configurations  that  you
                          referenced at the gen, not what  is  in
                          the machine.)

                      2.  Type 'RECONF' (At  this  time  TMDM  is
                          reconfiguring  the  300  Megabite disk.
                          On the display, if you did  right,  you
                          will  see  the  areas  that  are  being
                          relocated.  If you did this wrong,  you
                          will see [CONFIG ERRORS].  This is only
                          a  warning.   The  information  is  not
                          lost.  When you see this error it means
                          that your D01 file  is  wrong.   So  go
                          back to the system you genned it on and
                          start over.  Keep  your  ckt  into  the
                          TMCS  host.   If  you  do  not, someone
                          could  log  into  the  host  and   type
                          [INIT].   The  INIT  command is used to
                          zero  out  the  disk.    This   deletes
                          everything off the disk like node names
                          and host name and user profiles and all
                          the  related  material  that  make TMCS
                          work.  So if you do  not  have  a  good
                          copy on tape, start crying.  But do not
                          fear, you are not  lost.   Get  a  ARCH
                          STORE  off  another  TMCS  host  in the
                          network.  When the ARCH STORE  is  done
                          have the tape sent to wherever you need
                          it.  Then have  the  tape  put  on  the
                          drive  load  TMDM if you need to.  Then
                          type [ARCH RESTORE 0].  This will  dump
                          all  information  from  tape  to  disk.
                          This will take about 10 minutes.  After
                          a  "RESTORE" command, you must halt and
                          restart the slot.

                      3.  Commands needed for TMDM:

                          A.  DISP     CONFIG     -     (Displays
                              configuration old and new)

                          B.  RECONF - (Starts TMDM  to  relocate
                              areas on 300 MEG disk)

                      4.   Commands  needed  in  TMCS  for  error

                               CLEARING PORTS IN TMCS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  To free a port in TMCS to allow access to it.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Must be logged into TMCS.
                  2. Must have "HANG" license in TMCS.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  At the asterick prompt (*), type "WHO".  This  will  list
                  the  ports  in TMCS.  The port with the * next to it will
                  be the one that the user is currently utilizing.

              2.  At the next * prompt, type "HANG XX", with "XX" being the
                  port number that is to be cleared.


               COMMENT:

                  You may clear all  users  by  typing  "HANG  ALL"  and  a
                  carriage return.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                            CHANGING NETWORK SUPERVISORS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This document specifies the  procedure  to  be  used  for
                  moving  the  Network  Supervisor.  This procedure will be
                  defined in two different categories.  Scheduled moves and
                  unscheduled moves.


          II.  SCHEDULED MOVES

                  A scheduled Supervisor move is when  the  active  Network
                  Supervisor is put to sleep at a scheduled period of time,
                  and access to the Network is denied until another Network
                  Supervisor  is  awakened, and taken control of 75 percent
                  of the Network (75 percent of the nodes the Sup had  last
                  time active).

              1.  Prior to the actual move, make a copy of  the  ALL  NODES
                  List  (AN), the SHUT TABLE (LSHUT), the COUNT OF MACHINES
                  (COUNT), last accounting block collected (LACCT) and  the
                  number of accounting blocks remaining (ACCT).

              2.  On the active Supervisor, do TSLEEP, enter the  PASSWORD,
                  but do not do a carriage return at this time.
                  NOTE: The 'GSLEEP' command can be  used  for  a  Graceful
                        sleep,   in  place  of  'TSLEEP'.   Beware  of  the
                        assembled in GSLEEP period.   This  will  determine
                        how  long  to  wait  prior  to  entering  the TWAKE
                        command.  The GSLEEP  command  allows  the  sup  to
                        finish all pending logins as refuses new ones prior
                        to going to sleep.  This prevents hung users.

              3.  On the sleeping Supervisor,  you  are  moving  to,  do  a
                  TWAKE,  enter  the  Password,  but  do  not do a carriage
                  return.

              4.  You are now set to do the actual Supervisor move.

                  A.  Hit a carriage return on the active Supervisor.   You
                      will  get  the  time  the  Supervisor  went to sleep.
                      (024:11:00:38)

                  B.  Ten seconds after sleeping the active supervisor, hit
                      a carriage return on the sleeping Supervisor you wish
                      to take over  the  Net.   You'll  get  the  time  the
                      Supervisor was awakened.

                      The Supervisor takeover is complete when it  has  all
                      Tymnet  I  and II nodes under its control and nothing
                      is in TAKEOVER failure.

                      NOTE: Takeover failure is when a node is stuck in one
                      of its takeover states.  Tymnet I nodes have five (5)
                      states.  Tymnet II has two takeover states.  

                      On the logger, you'll get the node number of the node
                      in  takeover  failure  and  which  state  the node is
                      currently in.  TYMNET I has states  0-4.   TYMNET  II
                      has  state 0 only.  If you cannot correct the problem
                      with a retake of the upstream neighbor, notify  Field
                      Engineering (FE) of that particular region.

              5.  After the takeover is completed, the  following  must  be
                  accomplished.

                  A.  Do a LSTMIN on the Supervisor you have  just  put  to
                      sleep.  Get total logins.

                  B.  Type version on the active  Supervisor  and  get  the
                      version of code running PROBE, KERNEL and SUPER.

                  C.  Do an ALL NODES  (AN)  and  LIST  SHUTS  (LSHUT)  and
                      COUNT.   Compare  the  LSHUT  from the current active
                      Supervisor with the LSHUT  from  the  Supervisor  you
                      have   just   put  to  sleep.   There  should  be  no
                      difference  on  LSHUT  and  COUNT.   If  there  is  a
                      different  in  the COUNT, use the AN to determine the
                      discrepancy.

          I.  PURPOSE

                  The procedure outlines the means by which a recovery from
                  a network supervisor failure can be effected.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  Access to PROBE with full license.
                  2.  Physical access, either direct  or  indirect  to  the
                      failing network supervisor.


          III.  DEFINITION

                  A network supervisor (Sup)  failure  is  defined  as  any
                  condition  which  prevents  a supervisor from operating a
                  network in an acceptable and dependable manner.

              I.  Insuring that the Network has a fully operational  Active
                  Supervisor

                  In  the  event  of  a  supervisor  failure,  the  failing
                  supervisor  will  either  be  replaced automatically by a
                  standby supervisor or the failing supervisor will have to
                  be replaced by means of a manual supervisor move.

                  1.   If  an  operator  detects   a   supervisor   failure
                      condition, he may manually replace that supervisor in
                      accordance with the steps outlined in  the  procedure
                      NETWORK SUPERVISOR MOVES.

                  2.  If a Sup failure occurs  and  that  Sup  relinquishes
                      control  of  the network to a Sup which automatically
                      awakens:

                      a.  Make certain that only one supervisor  has  taken
                          over  the  network  by  performing the Probe STAT

                                                    PAGE  44

                          command on all of the supervisors on the network.
                          The  STAT  results  should  show only ONE (1) Sup
                          which is neither FROZEN nor SLEEPING.

                      b.  If necessary  use  the  Probe  TWAKE  and  TSLEEP
                          commands  to  exercise any necessary control over
                          the selection of the active Sup.

                      c.  If Probe access to any of the remaining  Sups  is
                          not available and can not be established, then:

                          1.  Observe the right most digit displayed on the
                              front panel of the inaccessible Sup.

                          2.   The  condition  of  the  Sup  then  can   be
                              determined  by  the sequence which that digit
                              is displaying.  (See below)

                              Digit Display     Interpretation                              _____ _______     ______________

                              Sequencing 0 - 1 The Sup is inactive  and  is
                                                recovering from a crash.

                              Sequencing 0 - 2  The  Sup  is  inactive  and
                                                probably  does  not have an
                                                operating   Supervisor   or
                                                Kernel code.

                              Sequencing 0 - 3 The Sup is inactive,  frozen
                                                and off of the run queue.

                              Sequencing 0 - 4 This indicates that the  Sup
                                                is inactive and sleeping.

                              Sequencing 0 - 5 This indicates that the  Sup
                                                is active.

                          3.  If a Sup can not be  accessed  through  Probe
                              and  that  Sup  is  active  when  another Sup
                              should be running the net, the "inaccessible"
                              Sup can be turned off to release it's control
                              of the network.

                          4.  The desired network supervisor  can  then  be
                              awakened  manually  or, if the desired Sup is
                              assigned the next highest drowsiness  factor,
                              it  can  be  allowed to take over the network
                              automatically.  (A manual  awakening  of  the
                              desired   Sup   will   be   much   less  time
                              consuming.)

              II.  Dealing with the Actual Supervisor Failure

SUPERVISOR FAILURES


                  1.  The procedure  NODE  FAILURE  and  RECOVERY  and  the
                      procedure   ISIS  SLOT  FAILURES  may  be  applicable
                      depending upon the exact nature of the failure.

                  2.  If doubt exists about the cause of the failure or the
                      proper  means  of  restoring the Sup to a serviceable
                      condition, support should be obtained  to  assist  in
                      that process.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                        STANDBY NETWORK SUPERVISOR TERMINALS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The procedure defines the way the standby Supervisors are
                  utilized.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  The standby Supervisors  have  terminals  located  within
                  Network  Control.   Each terminal will be logged into one
                  of the Network Supervisors, via PROBE.  One terminal will
                  have  an  active  Supervisor, the other terminals will be
                  logged into the other supervisors in a "ready" state.  


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  The standby Network Supervisor terminals  should  be  the
                  first  item  checked when starting turnover.  Each should
                  be logged into all existing Supervisor hosts via PROBE.

              2.  Checking the standby terminals, you  should  verify  that
                  the  terminal  is logged into the correct Host.  Check to
                  see that the terminal has a sufficient amount  of  paper.
                  Check  and  verify  the "TIME", the (DF) Drowiness Factor
                  and the state of the standby supervisor.

                  If a Supervisor is found to have a (DF) Drowiness  factor
                  other  than (0) zero, and/or in a state other than Active
                  or Sleeping, it should be noted in the  Control  logbook.
                  Check  wih  the  offgoing shift for the current status on
                  these Supervisors.  Also, a  Incident  report  should  be
                  open until the problem is resolved.

STANDBY TERMINALS


              3.   A  "LOG  S"  command  will  be  issued  on  all  standby
                  Supervisors.   This  will give a logger by seconds on the
                  Active Supervisor.  On the other  Supervisors,  the  last
                  time  that particular Supervisor went to sleep, should be
                  displayed.   Each  terminal  should  be  set  to  run  on
                  hardcopy,  except the terminal for the Active Supervisor.
                  The purpose of the  hardcopy  is  to  give  a  record  of
                  takeover, should the active Supervisor fail and a standby
                  Supervisor automatically starts taking over the Net.

              4.  If there is a problem with one of the terminals used  for
                  accessing  the standby Supervisors, another terminal will
                  be designated as a standby  terminal  until  the  regular
                  terminal is repaired.

              5.  Each standby terminal should be checked  at  least  three
                  (3) times during each shift.  

              6.  Problem with the standby Supervisors and terminals should
                  be reported to the appropriate support personnel.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                             NODE FAILURE AND RECOVERY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This   procedure    describes    the    techniques    for
                  trouble-shooting a failure of a node and its recovery.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Knowledge of TYM files.
                  2. Ability to use XRAY.
                  3. Access to loading facility, LOADII or ELF.
                  4. Access to the NODE CODE for the node that is down.
                  5. Access to PROBE.
                  6. Access to NAD (not essential).


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Verify that the node that is down is not DEADENDED  (only
                  1  connection  to  the  network).   This  can  be done by
                  checking the TYM file for the node that is down  (Network
                  Configuration section).

              2.  If the node is deadended, check its only neighbor using a
                  probe snap to verify that the neighbor is up.

              3.  If the neighbor node is down, it must first  be  returned
                  to  the  network  before  the  original node can come up.
                  Should the neighbor be  down,  go  back  to  STEP  1  and
                  proceed  until  you find a node which is up and which can
                  be used as a neighbor to access the down nodes.

              4.  Check the TYM file of the neighbor to get its KERNEL HOST
                  number.

              5.  Log into the neighbor node with XRAY and get the  LINE   
                  that goes to the node that is down.

              6.  Try a CRASH DUMP using LOADII.

                                                    PAGE  49
NODE FAILURE


              7.  If a crash table address is received (valid or not),  the
                  crash  dump has been received.  The dump is complete when
                  "EXIT" is displayed.  Go to STEP 13.

              8.  If a crash table is not received, the crash dump must  be
                  attempted from another neighbor and LINE   (get this info
                  using STEP 4).

              9.  If still no success, the  node  may  have  to  be  booted
                  manually.

             10.  Contact the site and request that they boot the node.  To
                  boot a full engine or mini-engine, have the site open the
                  front door of the node and on the 4th board down there is
                  a silver toggle switch on the right side.  They must push
                  this switch all the way up and all the way down.  To boot
                  a  micro-engine, have them press the "BOOT" button on the
                  back of the micro-engine.  An 'ATC' must be powered  off.
                  If it is found that a engine must be powered off to boot,
                  the problem should be turned out for repair.

             11.  If there is no one on site to boot the node, the hardware
                  support agency should be contacted to check out the node.

             12.  Once node is booted, repeat STEPs 5 and 6.

             13.  Reload the node with the production code, using the  same
                  neighbor and LINE   that was used in STEP 5.

             14.  If the node does not return to the network, try the  load
                  again.   If  the node still does not come up, contact the
                  support agency.

             15.  Verify node is back up with PROBE snap.

             16.  Verify all lines to node are back up by logging into node
                  with XRAY.

             17.  Analysis of crash dump can be performed using NAD and the
                  ENGDMP  command  file.   If  there is no access to NAD or
                  ENGDMP, turn the crash dump over to the support agency.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                    ANALYZING ENGINE CRASH TABLES IN CODE DUMPS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure will outline the steps that can  be  taken
                  to analyze the crash table information which is contained
                  in engine code dumps.


          II.  COMMENTS

                  It should be remembered  that  the  engine  is  a  single
                  processor system and that during a crash, which is due to
                  a malfunction, there is  a  very  good  chance  that  the
                  machine  simply  will  not be capable of storing accurate
                  and meaningful data concerning the details of the  crash.
                  It is not realistic to expect that every engine code dump
                  will be meaningful and definitive.


          III.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  Access to NAD
                  2.  Access to the NAD Command File: ENGDMP


          IV.  PROCEDURE

                  1.  The dump of the engine code must be written to a file
                      on a host where the NAD software can be accessed.

                  2.  Run NAD and after the version number is printed, type
                      ;X (xxxxx)ENGDMP

                      Where xxxxx = the directory  under  which  the  file:
                      ENGDMP is stored.

                  3.  The command file will execute and prompt for the file
                      name  of  the  node  code  dump.   Respond  with  the
                      appropriate dump file name and terminate the filename
                      with a (CTL)D as instructed by the command file.

DUMP ANALYSIS


                  4.   The  command  file:   ENGDMP   will   exercise   the
                      appropriate  commands  in  NAD and then print out the
                      following:

                          a.  General information about the node.
                          b.   A  crash  table  summary  for  the  last  16
                              crashes.
                          c.  A detailed crash table on the first crash.
                          d.  A detailed crash table on the last crash.


          V.  INTERPRETATION

                  1.  NEITHER crashes due to POWER FAILS nor due to  MANUAL
                      RESTARTS  will  be  reported  in  the  detailed crash
                      tables for the first and last crash.

                  2.  The summary crash tables is a push down stack meaning
                      that  the  most  recent crash will be displayed first
                      followed then by each earlier crash in sequence.

                  3.  Crash ID's may  be  interpreted  with  the  following
                      table:

                      Crash codes will be one  byte,  with  the  high-order
                      nibble  designating  the  general  crash type and the
                      low-order nibble giving additional information.

                        2x - Parity error
                        20 - Non-DMA

                                NETWORK NODE OUTAGE



          I.  PURPOSE

               This procedure outlines actions to be taken in the
               event of a Network Node Outage.

          II.  DEFINITION

               NETWORK NODE OUTAGE:  A  network  node  outage  is
               defined as a node which is not accessable, nor can
               it be accounted for  by  the  network  Supervisor.
               This   may   result   from   a   hardware/software
               malfunction, or a  transmission  facility  company
               problem.

          III.  PROCEDURE

               In the event of a network node failure, follow the
               procedure below to restore service:

           A.  Wait for ten minutes to determine  if  the  outage
               will clear itself (ie.  power failure).

              1.  If the outage clears,  record  the  outage  per
                  existing documented procedures.  

              2.  If the problem does not clear, proceed  to  the
                  next step.

           B.  Site Evaluation: This step  involves  calling  the
               site of the nodal location for evaluation of Telco
               equipment,   machinery    environment,    customer
               equipment   and   nodal   hardware.   It  will  be
               necessary to call the site and locate someone that
               is  familiar  with  the  node  and  its associated
               equipment.

              1.  Determine if the customer site  has  taken  the
                  node  down  for  any reason.  If yes, ask to be
                  notified when it is returned to service.  Leave
                  a  call  back  number and then OnTyme the field
                  engineering group.

NODE OUTAGE


              2.  Determine if there has  been  an  environmental
                  failure.  Environmental problems are defined as
                  a loss  of  power,  loss  of  air  conditioning
                  (A/C),  or  a  site  fire.   In the event of an
                  environmental failure, proceed as follows:

                  * Ask  to  be  notified  when  the  environment
                     returns to normal.

                  * Leave call-back information.

                     If the environment has returned  to  normal,
                     continue the evaluation.

                 3.  Have  the  site  contact  perform  a  visual
                     inspection  of  the  node.  Determine if the
                     node is in an operational state.  If  it  is
                     not, notify Network Field Engineering of the
                     outage.   Specify  the  type  of   equipment
                     involved.

                 4.   Perform   an   evaluation   of   associated
                     equipment.    Have   the  customer  visually
                     inspect the modem  or  DSU  for  an  obvious
                     malfunction.   Perform  tests  on the DSU or
                     modem as appropriate including loopback test
                     and self tests.

                  * If either of these test should  fail,  report
                   the  problem  and results to appropriate Telco
                   group or modem vendor.

              5.  If all of the above items  prove  inconclusive,
                  then  the problem should be reported to Network
                  Field Engineering.

              6.  If it is not possible to contact the site do to
                  a  ring-no-answer  (R/NA), a dump and reload of
                  the node should be attempted.  

              7.  During regular working hours, node outages will
                  be    reported   to   the   appropriate   field
                  engineering  region  via  telephone,  and  then
                  followed up with an OnTyme (an OnTyme will also
                  be sent when the node returns to the Network).

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                           ISIS SLOT FAILURE AND RECOVERY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This   procedure    describes    the    techniques    for
                  trouble-shooting  a failure of an ISIS slot and the means
                  by which the slot may be restored to service.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Knowledge of TYM files.
                  2. Ability to use DDT.
                  3. Access to loading facility, LOADII or ELF.
                  4. Access to the SLOT CODE for the slot that is down.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  Make a determination of the slot(s) associated  with  the
                  problem reported or detected.  

              2.  Log into DDT in the node(s) containing the slot(s)  which
                  are considered suspect.

              3.  At the "slot#" prompt, type in the  number  to  the  slot
                  that is to be checked.

              4.  When the "*" prompt appears, the user is connected to the
                  slot.

              5.  Look for any greeting message  to  the  slot  that  might
                  indicate trouble, ie.  "HALTED" or "STOPPED", etc.

              6.  ALWAYS type ?HOST in the slot.  If "Dispatcher  indicates
                  slot is down" shows, this is a definite response that the
                  slot is down.

              7.  Should the slot be running  a  constant  "RESTART",  also
                  referred  to  as "crashing continuously", the "H" command
                  should be  issued.   This  will  halt  the  slot.   (L.H.
                  license is required for this command.)

ISIS SLOT FAILURE


              8.  Type ?HIST for a history of any slot halts.  Look for the
                  slot  that  is  being  checked  to  see  when  it stopped
                  running.

              9.  Exit from DDT by typing 2 "Z"'s.  

             10.  Run the CRASH  program.   This  may  give  some  valuable
                  information  as to the crash count of the slot as well as
                  the crash id.  Manual examination of the slot crash table
                  can  be  done  while  in the slot using ISISII manual for
                  cross reference of crash table definitions.

             11.  Make certain the slot is halted and then dump  the  slot,
                  using  the  "U"  command  in LOADII.  This will allow the
                  software support to analyze the software in the condition
                  it  was  in when the slot stopped operating.  (The kernel
                  host of the target node and the target slot  number  will
                  be necessary for this step.)

             12.  Reload the slot using the "S" command  in  LOADII.   Load
                  the production code for the slot.

             13.  Log back into the node containing the slot.  Repeat STEPs
                  3 through 6.

             14.  If the slot is back up, there will be a report as to  the
                  condition of the host when the ?HOST is issued.

             15.  Should the slot still be down, the support agency  should
                  be   notified  as  soon  as  possible.   All  information
                  gathered in STEPs 9 and 10 (name of the dump)  should  be
                  passed onto them.  

             16.  Exit the slot using the double "Z" command.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                              FORCE NODE TO BOOTSTRAP



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure describes various ways  in  which  a  node
                  running  on  the  network can be forced to go to its BOOT
                  for DOWNLINE access by LOADII or ELF.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  Access to the node directly or through a third party.
                  2.  Access to XRAY (with privileged status) in the target
                      node.
                  3.  Access to DDT (with  license  L.SYA)  in  the  target
                      node.
                  4.  Access to PROBE with Status "10".


          III.  PROCEDURES

              A.  To  send  Engine  or  MiniEngine  to  its  DOWNLINE  BOOT
                  manually:

                  1.  Open the front door of the engine.

                  2.  Locate the toggle-switch on the  right  side  of  the
                      Multi-Function card.  (The MF card is the fourth card
                      down from the top of the card cage.)

                  3.  Lift the Multi-Function  card  toggle-switch  against
                      the  internal  spring  loading  until it is fully up.
                      Then move the switch to the full down position.

                      NOTE: In some cases, the boot switch may be  left  in
                            the   center   position,   ie.   OFF  position.
                            Normally, this will be done only in cases where
                            it is necessary to "Freeze" a node in its crash
                            configuration to determine  the  cause  of  the
                            crash.

                  4.  The left most digit  displayed  on  the  front  panel
                      should begin to sequence from 0 through F repeatedly.

BOOT NODE


                      The right side of the front panel  will  display  the
                      version  of  the  boot resident in the Multi-Function
                      card.

                      NOTE: A MiniEngine will not necessarily  be  equipped
                             with a front panel.

                  5.  Close the front door of the machine.

              B.  To send a MicroEngine to its DOWNLINE BOOT manually:

                  1.  Locate the Boot Switch on the rear  of  the  machine.
                      The switch will be a protected pushbutton and will be
                      marked "BOOT".

                  2.  Depress the Boot Switch and release it.

                  3.  The "RUN" indicator on  the  front  panel  should  be
                      illuminated.

                  4.  The machine will now be running in its DOWNLINE BOOT.

             C.   To  Boot  an  Asynchronous  Terminal  Concentrator  (ATC)
                  manually:

                  1.  The ATC boot  brings  the  entire  node's  code  into
                      memory  from  the node's internal PROMs.  (Booting an
                      ATC does not load a DOWNLINE BOOTSTRAP.)

                  2.  To Boot the code into  the  ATC's  memory,  turn  the
                      power  switch OFF, wait for ten seconds and then turn
                      the power switch ON.

                  3.  The machine will then initialize  and  begin  to  run
                      it's code.

              D.  To force a Micro, Mini or Engine to it Boot via PROBE:

                   NOTE: For this procedure to work the machine must be  on
                         the  network.   Also, be aware that this procedure
                         is the preferred method of forcing a node  to  its
                         Boot through the network.

                  1.  Log into PROBE in the active supervisor.

                  2.  At the PROBE prompt, type: DLOAD xxxx (where xxxx  is
                      the  number  of  the  node you wish to have go to its
                      Bootstrap).

                  3.  If the command fails to send the node to its Boot, it
                      is probably because:

BOOT NODE


                      a.  The MiniEngine  or  Engine  Boot  switch  on  the
                          Multi-Function  card  is  disabled,  ie.  in it's
                          center rather than down position.  (See  Note  in
                          STEP III.A.3)
                      b.  The MicroEngine has been internally  optioned  to
                          prevent  DLOAD  commands from forcing the machine
                          to it's Boot.
                      c.  Attempt Procedures V.  and VI.  if this procedure
                          fails.

              E.  To force a Micro, Mini or Engine to BOOT via XRAY:

                  NOTE: For this procedure to work the machine must  be  on
                         the network.

                  1.  Log into XRAY in the target node.

                  2.  Set privileged status in XRAY.

                  3.  Type: BT in response to the XRAY prompt.

                  4.  Attempt Procedures IV.  and VI.   if  this  procedure
                      fails.

              F.  To force an ISIS Micro, Mini or Engine  to  it  Boot  via
                  DDT:

                  NOTE: For this procedure to work the machine must  be  on
                         the  network and the copy of the bootstrap left in
                         memory from the last  booting  operation  MUST  be
                         intact.

                  1.  Log into DDT in the target machine.

                  2.  In response to the SLOT? prompt, type: !

                  3.  At the next DDT prompt, type: ?SLOT .

                  4.  If the slot is identified as FF  proceed.   Otherwise
                      get into Slot FF.

                  5.  In response to the DDT prompt, type: G 5A

                  6.  In a few seconds the machine will leave  the  network
                      and your DDT circuit will drop.

                  7.  If you cannot access the machine then through  LOADII
                      or  ELF, you will have to assume that the copy of the
                      Boot resident in memory was corrupted  and  you  will
                      have to have the machine MANUALLY booted.

               COMMENTS:

                  Putting a machine into its boot will interrupt all of the
                  service being provided by the machine.  It should also be
                  remembered that preferred sequence of  methods  attempted
                  to force a machine to its boot is:

                         1. PROBE's "DLOAD" command.
                         2. XRAY's "BT" command.
                         3. DDT's "Go location" command.

                  NOTE: Remember that if 1.  fails, attempting  to  use  2.
                        and 3.  are gambles.

                            NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURE


                                DELOADS AND RELOADS



          I.  OVERVIEW

                  A  condition  that  necessitates   loading   code   which
                  includes:  The  introduction  of a new version of code, a
                  change in the local configuration, or reloading  after  a
                  maintenance procedure.

          II.  DEFINITION

              A.  DLOAD: The process by which the first few instructions of
                  executable  code  are entered into the node.  This forces
                  the online machine to go  into  the  boot  strap  program
                  (leave the network), and await further instruction.

              B.  RELOAD: A downline loading program used to load a  binary
                  image  of executable code and interface parameters into a
                  Tymnet technology network.

          III.  PROCEDURE

              A.  Choosing a neighbor node: The controller must be able  to
                  build  a virtual circuit from the host system running the
                  LOADII program or from ELF to the neighbor node and  then
                  to  the  node  to be reloaded.  The neighbor node must be
                  running and under the Supervisors control.  It must  also
                  have  passthrough capacity.  To act as a downline loading
                  neighbor, the machine must be running a downline loadable
                  version  of  code  itself.  Some Bisync Varian Tymcoms do
                  not meet this requirement.

              B.  DELOADing and RELOADing Engines: No special  instructions
                  are required other than choosing the correct neighbor and
                  line    number.     ***    WARNING:    Physical     lines
                  2,3,6,7,10,11,14  and  15  do  not  raise request to send
                  signals while running the boot strap.  This may  cause  a
                  loss  of  some  records.   It is therefore prefereable to
                  choose a line which does raise request to send.

                                   NETWORK SHUTS



          I.   PURPOSE
               This procedure is intended as a  guideline  for  individuals
               attempting to control routing paths within the network.  


          II.  DEFINITIONS
               Shut.  A condition known to the Supervisor that eliminates a
               particular  link  from  consideration  in the cost algorithm
               used in data routing.  Note that  a  shut  is  on  the  link
               level, not on the line level.

               Line.  A connection between two or more  points  over  which
               data is transmitted.  One or more comprise a link.

               Link.  A communications  path  between  any  pair  of  nodal
               communications processors.  Telecommunications equipment and
               procedures for transmitting information between locations in
               the network.


          III. REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  Access to PROBE with STATUS 20 license.


          IV.  COMMENTS

               A. A shut, or multiple shuts, is used by network control  to
                  handle  routing  problems  caused by anomalies or project
                  work.  It constitutes the removal of a link or node  from
                  the network.

               B. Nodes should always have one link  to  the  network  left
                  open  (un-shut), and all links to dead-ended nodes should
                  remain open (un-shut).

               C. Multiline-links do not require a shut if  maintenance  is
                  to  be  performed  on  a link while the link is still up.
                  The exception to this is when a  56KB  multiline-link  is
                  involved,  and the line to be removed is the 56KB section
                  and not the 9.6KB back-up.

                                                    PAGE  65
SHUTS


               D. When a failure occurs in a 56KB primary line, a  shut  is
                  placed  on the whole link until the 56KB line is restored
                  to the network.  This keeps its 9.6 back-up from becoming
                  overloaded for a sustained period.


          V.   PROCEDURE

               A. Shuts may be  entered  and  removed  with  the  following
                  commands:

                  1. PROBE commands to enter shuts
                     a. NSHUT XXXX
                        Shuts all of the links on  the  node  specified  by
                        XXXX
                     b. ESHUT XXXX YYYY
                        Shuts the link between nodes XXXX and YYYY
                  2. PROBE commands to remove shuts
                     a. CLEAR XXXX
                        Removes shuts from an entire node
                     b. RSHUT XXXX YYYY
                        Clears a shut between nodes XXXX and YYYY
                  3. The process of entering and  removing  shuts  requires
                     only that a choice be made of the commands to be used.
                     The choice would be based on the existing situation.

                  Use of NSHUT and CLEAR would be appropriate for  shutting
                  and  removing shuts on all links attached to a node while
                  ESHUT and RSHUT would be  appropriate  for  shutting  and
                  clearing a single link.

          III.  PROCEDURES

              1.  Disconnect  the  modem(s),  terminal  device(s)  or  host
                  port(s) from the suspected Engine ASYNC ports.

              2.  Loopback the  suspected  port(s)  in  one  of  the  three
                  following ways:

                  a.  By removing the ASYNC RIBBON CABLE(S) from  the  edge
                      of  the  ASYNC  Board  and  installing  TYMNET  ASYNC
                      LOOP-BACK PLUGS (P/N AST6-1) in place of  the  ribbon
                      cable(s).

                  b.   By  installing  TYMNET  loop-back   plugs   on   the
                      appropriate  Engine  connector-panel jacks.  (Use P/N
                      AST7-1 for 37pin connectors, P/N 630030-001 for 25pin
                      connectors)

                  c.  By installing a breakout box on a specific port  with
                      RD looped back to TD, DSR looped back to DTR and with
                      RTS looped back to DCD.

ISIS ASYNC PORT


              3.  Load SLASYN.NIB into the appropriate slot.

              4.  Log into DDT in  the  target  machine,  transfer  to  the
                  appropriate   slot   and   gain   access  to  the  SLASYN
                  diagnostic.

              5.   Establish  the  parameters  for  SLASYN  which   closely
                  approximate  the  conditions  on  the  port  when  it  is
                  failing.  Signal  toggling  should  normally  be  enabled
                  during testing.

              6.  Reset and Start the diagnostic then display  the  results
                  periodically to observe the testing process.

              7.  If the  test  fails,  the  appropriate  hardware  support
                  agency  should  be  called upon for assistance.  When the
                  problem  is  reported  cleared  verify  that  the  SLASYN
                  diagnostic runs by repeating STEPS 3 though 6.

              8.  Insure that the proper production is loaded into the slot
                  and verify with DDT that the slot is running.

              9.  Make certain that  all  loopbacks  are  removed  and  the
                  cables are connected.

             10.  Verify with the person reporting the problem that service
                  has, in actual fact, been restored.


               COMMENTS:

                  When the diagnostic SLASYN.NIB is loaded into a slot, all
                  production  service  in  that  slot  will be interrupted.
                  However, service in other slots within the target machine
                  will not be affected.

                  8.  Ability to run SLSYNC diagnostic.


               COMMENTS:

                  For procedural purposes, we will identify the 2  networks
                  involved by letter.

                  NET-A will contain the following:                  _____ ____ _______ ___ __________
                  a. GATEWAY HOST NUMBER
                  b. GATEWAY SLOT CODE
                  c. SYNC LINE TO NET-B (referenced in TYM  file  for  slot
                                     with gateway code) 

                  NET-B will contain the following:                  _____ ____ _______ ___ __________
                  a. PSEUDO NODE NUMBER
                  b. SYNC LINE TO NET-A (referenced in TYM file for slot  0
                                     of  the  REAL NODE that the gateway is
                                     connected to)
                  c. REAL NODE          (has the physical connection of the
                                     sync  line for the gateway via slot 0.
                                     The PSEUDO NODE will be listed as  the
                                     neighbor.)

GATEWAY FAILURE


               GENERAL INFO:

                  Circuit number on both sides of the gateway is always the
                   same.
                  Gateway pseudo-node number is always TYMNET I (less than
                   2000).


          III.  PROCEDURE FOR "HOST SHUT"

              1.  This message indicates that the REAL NODE  in  NET-B  has
                  gone  out  of  the network or the circuit for the gateway
                  has been lost.

              2.  Verify that the REAL NODE is up by snapping it  in  PROBE
                  in  NET-B.   If node is down, follow procedure to restore
                  node to a network, once it is back up, the  gateway  will
                  come back up.

              3.  If REAL NODE is up,  the  indication  is  then  that  the
                  circuit  has been lost between NET-A and NET-B.  Turn the
                  circuit over to Telco to test the line.  If Telco reports
                  no problem found and gateway is still shut, SLSYNC should
                  be run to determine which end has  the  problem.   Follow
                  the  procedure "TROUBLE-SHOOTING NON-HARDWIRED INTERNODAL
                  LINES".


          IV.  PROCEDURE FOR "HOST NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH NET"

              COMMENTS:

                  STEPs IV.2 and IV.3 require  access  to  NET-A  utilities
                  which may not be available to the user of this procedure.
                  In such a case, the user should contact NET-A's  customer
                  service  group  and  request that they perform STEPs IV.2
                  and IV.3.

              1.  This message indicates that the node in NET-A  containing
                  the  gateway slot code is out of the network, or that the
                  slot containing the gateway code has stopped operating.

              2.  To check if node is up, snap it in PROBE  in  NET-A.   If
                  the  node  is  down, follow the procedure to bring a node
                  back up.  Once node is back up,  the  gateway  will  come
                  back up.

GATEWAY FAILURE


              3.  If the node is up, snap the gateway host number in  PROBE
                  in  NET-A.   If "NO SUCH HOST", the slot is down.  Follow
                  the procedure to bring a slot back  up.   The  host  will
                  show  as "shut" for a moment, once slot is running again.
                  This is the time  it  takes  for  it  to  initialize  and
                  establish contact.  Once the host is "ANSWERED" in PROBE,
                  the gateway will be back up.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                              PORT SPEWING CHARACTERS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure defines the steps  taken  when  the  "Port
                  Spewing Characters" message is received.


          II.  DEFINITION

                  Port Spewing Characters can be  defined  as  a  condition
                  where  an  asynchonous  port  is in an open condition and
                  continuously   floods   the   Network   Supervisor   with
                  characters.  If this condition is allowed to continue, it
                  could possibly cause the  active  Network  Supervisor  to
                  crash.


          III.  PROCEDURE

                  Sample of TMCS Logger Message:
                  *4/29/83 23:02:28 node  PORT port  <in  decimal>  SPEWING
                  CHARACTERS <30>

                  The specified async port is running  without  restriction
                  and flooding the supervisor with logon characters.

              1.  Do a retake of the node 'SPEWING CHARACTERS'.  This  will
                  cause  the active Supervisor to take another look at that
                  particular node and hopefully  reset  the  port  that  is
                  'SPEWING CHARACTERS'.

              2.  If STEP 1 is not successful, try to have  access  to  the
                  port disabled by calling the site and either:

                 *having the modem busied out if the  port  connects  to  a
                  modem
                                          or
                 *having the terminal turned off if the port  is  hardwired
                  to a terminal

              3.  If STEP 2 is not  successful,  take  the  node  down  and
                  reload it.

PORT SPEWING CHARACTERS


              4.  If a reload does not correct the problem, DLOAD the  node
                  and  leave it down until hardware support can be obtained
                  at the node site.

                            XRAY: LINK/LINE PERFORMANCE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The purpose of this procedure is to define the methods by
                  which  information  relative to a link/line's performance
                  can be obtained with the utility XRAY.

                        2. WINDOW SIZE
                        3. NUMBER of CIRCUITS
                        4. LINK and LINE TYPES
                        5. SPEED
                        6. TIME LINK ATTACHED/DETACHED

                  1.  Log into XRAY in one of  the  nodes  into  which  the
                      target LINK/LINE terminates.

                  2.  In response to the XRAY prompt, type: ND

                  3.  The above information will be printed out in response
                      to the "ND" command.

                      NOTE: The ERRATE is an indication of the  error  rate
                            which  exists  on  the  line.   The  best  line
                            condition is  represented  by  no  entry  under
                            ERRATE  for that line.  The worst error rate is
                            represented by ****.  A single "star" (*) would
                            indicate a line is degrading, a double ** would
                            indicate  a  poor  line,  a  triple  ***  would
                            indicate  a  bad  line,  and  four  ****  would
                            indicate a very bad line.

XRAY LINK PERFORMANCE


                  1.  Log into XRAY in the node at end of the target link.

                  2.  At the XRAY prompt, type: KS xxxx (where xxxx =  node
                      number of the neighbor at the other end of the link)

                  3.  Observe the terminal output for the above parameters.

              D.  To obtain an XRAY CRYPTO  Log  Output  of  Specific  Link
                  Messages

                  1.  It is possible  to  retrieve  specific  link  related
                      CRYPTO  LOG  outputs  from the pool of the "last 256"
                      CRYPTO LOG messages by:

                      a.  Logging into XRAY in a node at one end of a link.

                      b.  Typing: CM n1 n2 ---- n8 (where n1 n2 ---- n8 are
                          CRYPTO LOG message numbers)

                              EXAMPLE: CM 1 2 4 

                              The EXAMPLE CM command shown above will yield
                              all Link Up, DOWN, and DETACHED Crypto Logger
                              messages that are  in  the  last  256  Crypto
                              Logger messages generated by the node.

                  2.   Use  the  XRAY  documentation  for  Message   Number
                      definitions.

                              PERFORMANCE OF LINK/LINE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The purpose of this procedure is to define the methods by
                  which  information  relative to a link/line's performance
                  can be recovered with the utility PROBE.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access to PROBE in the Active Supervisor
                  2. Access to PROBE documentation for Reference


          III.  PROCEDURE

              A.  Obtaining LINE SPEED and STATUS

                  1.  Log into PROBE  in  the  active  supervisor  for  the
                      network containing THE LINES WHICH ARE TO BE CHECKED.

                  2.  To determine the current LINE SPEED and STATUS (Shut,
                      Out  Frozen)  can be obtained by using PROBE's "NODE"
                      command.

                          The  resulting  PROBE  output  will  contain  the
                          desired   information   under  the  heading  LINK
                          STATUS.

                          PLEASE NOTE: An OUT status indicates a link is in
                                       the  process  of  being  returned to
                                       service after outage.

                                       If a link  is  out  of  service  and
                                       attempts   are  not  being  made  to
                                       restore it to service, there will be
                                       no indication of the link under LINK
                                       STATUS.

                                       SHUT  indicates   that   a   network
                                       operator  has  taken the link out of
                                       service.

PROBE LINE PERFORMANCE


                                       FROZEN indicates that the  link  has
                                       been  detached  but has not yet been
                                       declared down.

              B.  Obtaining a LINK  LOGGER  REPORTS,  both  Historical  and
                  Realtime

                  1.  A HISTORY of link reports or the ability  to  MONITOR
                      link  reports  in  realtime  can be obtained with the
                      PROBE "RNODE" "LOG" commands.  The  resulting  output
                      will  contain  link  reports  for  all  links  on the
                      specified node.  It is not  possible  with  PROBE  to
                      restrict link reports down to a single link.  If TMCS
                      is available, it's ability to restrict to a  specific
                      link   would  make  it  a  more  logical  choice  for
                      obtaining this type of information.

                      EXAMPLE OF PROBE COMMAND SEQUENCE:

                           RNODE xxxx (where xxxx = one of  the  two  nodes
                                       attached to the target link)

                           LOG zzzzESX (where zzzz = the number of  minutes
                                       back  from the current time that you
                                       wish to back up the logger (ie.  LOG
                                       34ESX) or the date (julian) and time
                                       (GMT) from which you would  like  to
                                       begin   receiving  information  (ie.
                                       241:12:45))

              C.  Obtaining STATUS on all the Links Assigned to a Node

                  1.  In PROBE only the SYNPRT command displays the  status
                      of all of the LINKS assigned to the node.

                  2.  To  obtain  the  SYNPRT  command  output  respond  to
                      PROBE's prompt with the following sequence:

                           RLOG 1D0
                           SYNPRT xxxx (where xxxx = target node number)
                           LOG 1C

                  3.  The command output will be displayed on the terminal.
                      Even  information  relative  to  assigned  but UNUSED
                      links will be displayed.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                            TMCS: LINK/LINE PERFORMANCE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The purpose of this procedure is to define the methods by
                  which  information  relative to a link/line's performance
                  can be obtained with the utility TMCS.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. Access to TMCS.                      
                  2. Access to TMCS documentation.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              A.  Obtaining LINE SPEED and STATUS

                  1.  Log into TMCS

                  2.  At the prompt, type: LIS SEL

                  3.  Make certain  that  the  desired  LINK  and  LINE  is
                      included under the "LINKS" and "LINES" parameters.

                         (If the LINK or LINE is not  included  it  can  be
                          included again with the RESTORE command providing
                          both neighbors on the line or link  are  included
                          in  the  NODES  parameter  recovered  via STEP 2.
                          Example: RESTORE LINK 2001:2055)

                  4.  At the TMCS prompt, type: PROBE

                  5.  You may now issue Probe's  "NODE"  command  and  LINE
                      SPEED  and  STATUS  will be printed under the heading
                      "LINK STATUS".

                      NOTE: The status OUT means a link has been out and is
                             in process or returning to service.

                             The SHUT status indicates a  network  operator
                             has taken the link out of service.

LINE PERFORMANCE


                             The FROZEN status indicates that the link  has
                             been  detached  but  has not yet been declared
                             down.

                  6.  To return to TMCS from  PROBE  simply  type:  EXI  in
                      response to the PROBE prompt.

              B.  Obtaining LOGGER Reports for LINK/LINES

                  1.  Both Historical and Realtime  LINK  and  LINE  Logger
                      reports   can  be  collected  through  TMCS.   It  is
                      possible, in fact, to restrict the logger  report  to
                      just specific LINES and/or LINKS.

                  2.  Log into TMCS

                  3.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS SEL

                  4.  At the TMCS prompt, type the following:

                          IGNORE LINKS
                          IGNORE LINES
                          IGNORE EVENTS
                          IGNORE ISIS
                          RESTORE EVENTS 18 19 26 27 28 33 36 43 47 48 
                          RESTORE LINKS xxxx:yyyy wwww:zzzz  (Note 1)
                          RESTORE LINES aaaa:cc              (Note 2)
                          LOG bbbbbbbb                       (Note 3)

                      Note 1: xxxx yyyy and wwww zzzz are the node  numbers
                              on  which  the  LINK  terminates.   Skip  the
                              "RESTORE LINKS" command if LINK messages  are
                              not required.

                      Note 2: aaaa is a neighbor number on a line and cc is
                              a port number which could be obtained through
                              XRAY's  "ND"  command  or   through   PROBE's
                              "SYNPRT"  command.   If LINE messages are not
                              required, skip the RESTORE LINES command.

                      Note 3: bbbbbbbb represents the number of minutes you
                              wish  to  have the logger backed up or it can
                              represent the DATE and TIME (GMT) from  which
                              you want the logger to start.

                                       EXAMPLE:  LOG 304
                                                 LOG 07/22/85 12:15

                  5.  TMCS will now output link and  line  logger  messages
                      for  those  lines and links specified in the "RESTORE
                      LINKS" and "RESTORE LINES" commands indicated in STEP
                      B.4 above.

LINE PERFORMANCE


                  6.  By changing the events used, it is  possible  to  see
                      very  specific  logger  messages.  Reference the TMCS
                      documentation for identification of message numbers.

              C.  Using the TMCS DISPLAY Mode

                  1.  Log into TMCS 

                  2.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS SEL

                  3.  Verify that LINES and LINKS of interest are selected.

                 (Use the "RESTORE LINKS", "RESTORE LINES", "IGNORE  LINKS"
                  and  "IGNORE  LINES" commands to adjust the SELECTIONS to
                  the existing requirements.)

                  4.  At the TMCS prompt, type: LIS PRO

                  5.  In the first line of the  response  a  terminal  type
                      will be identified just to the right of the user name
                      with which you logged into TMCS.

                  6.  If your terminal is not comparable  to  the  terminal
                      type  identified  in the LIS PRO output, use the TMCS
                      "TER" command  to  set  TMCS  up  for  your  specific
                      terminal.

                              Type: TER ? in response to the TMCS prompt to
                                     obtain  a  list  of  possible terminal
                                     types.

                              Type:  TER  xxxxxxx  to  set  TMCS  for  your
                                     terminal.    (where   xxxxxxx   =  the
                                     terminal type)

                  7.  Now in response to the TMCS prompt, type: DISPLAY

                  8.  A display listing LINK/LINE condition  will  then  be
                      presented.   Node  and  host  conditions will also be
                      displayed.

              1.  Using PROBE place a SHUT in the line  and  using  the  ND
                  command  in  XRAY determine if the number of users on the
                  line is sufficiently low to proceed to STEP 2  where  the
                  line will be taken down.

              2.  Jumper Pin 4 to Pin 11 on a breakout box.

              3.  Remove the cable from Port x of Node A.

              4.  Install the breakout box on Port x but do not connect the
                  cable to the breakout box.

              5.  Using LOADII or ELF, attempt to load  LINTST.REL  through
                  Port  x  of  NODE  A.   (The breakout box will act as the
                  target for the load)

              6.  If the terminal logged into the load utility  (LOADII  or
                  ELF)  displays  any  indications  of "Lost Data", you are
                  receiving an indication of errors and NODE A will require
                  servicing.   After  servicing  has  been completed, go to
                  STEP 14.

              7.  If LINTST.REL loads without losing data,  disconnect  the
                  breakout  box from Port x and connect the breakout box to
                  the cable end which was initially disconnected from  Port
                  x.

              8.  Terminate any "loading" of LINTST.REL currently  underway
                  through  NODE  A  and  attempt to do a load of LINTST.REL
                  through Port y of NODE B.

              9.  If the load utility being used does not indicate any lost
                  data, go to STEP 11.

             10.  If data is being "lost", remove the breakout box from the
                  cable,  disconnect  the  cable  from Port y of NODE B and
                  connect the breakout box to Port y of NODE  B.   (Do  not
                  connect the cable to the breakout box.)

             11.  Stop and restart the load of LINTST.REL through Port y of
                  NODE  B.   If  data  is  still  lost, NODE B will require
                  servicing.  If data is not lost, either the cable is  bad
                  or the drivers and/or receivers on Port y are not able to
                  drive the  cable's  electrical  load.   In  either  event
                  servicing  will  be  required.   After  the  servicing is
                  completed, go to STEP 14.

             12.  Make certain that the cable is reconnected to Port  x  of
                  NODE A and disconnected from Port y of NODE B.

             13.  Connect the breakout box to the cable  end  removed  from
                  Port y but do not connect the breakout box to Port y.

             14.  Terminate any loads which are in progress and restart the
                  loading  of LINTST.REL through Port x of NODE A.  If data
                  is lost during the load, you may  be  observing  a  cable
                  program  but  you  are probably observing an inability of
                  NODE A to properly drive the cable's electrical load.

             15.  After servicing is complete, rerun any tests which failed
                  to verify the effectiveness of the service effort.

             16.  Reconnect the inter-nodal line to the appropriate ports.

             17.  Terminate any loads which are underway.

             18.  Observe the line with PROBE, XRAY or TMCS for any further
                  indications of problems.

INTER NODAL LINK


                      NOTE: The points at  which  to  loopbacks  occur  are
                      depicted above.

              1.  If the problem is link error-rates, Log into XRAY in each
                  of the nodes into which the link terminates.

                  a.  Type: ND in XRAY in both nodes to obtain WINDOW SIZE

                  b.  Compare the WINDOW SIZE parameters for the link.   If
                      they   do  not  match,  the  TYM  file(s)  should  be
                      corrected and the new code should  be  generated  and
                      loaded into the machines.

                  c.  The health of the line/link should then be  monitored
                      to determine if the errors on the line have stopped.

                  d.  If the problem has been cleared, you need proceed  no
                      further.

              2.  Using PROBE place a  SHUT  in  the  line  and  when  XRAY
                  indicates the number of users on the line is sufficiently
                  low, proceed to STEP 2.

              3.  Run a self test on both modems.  If either  modem  fails,
                  request service on the modem and then go to STEP 13.

              4.  Run an end-to-end test between the modems to  verify  the
                  line  condition.   If the test fails, service on the line
                  and possibly one  or  more  modems  is  required.   After
                  servicing, go to STEP 13.

              5.  Place MODEM A and MODEM B in AL loopback (LL  if  digital
                  modems are being used.)

              6.  Using either LOADII or ELF  start  a  load  of  the  file
                  LINTST.REL from NODE A toward NODE B.

              7.  If the load utility shows that data is being "lost",  you
                  have  an  indication  that  either  NODE A is at fault or
                  there is a cabling problem between NODE A  and  MODEM  A.
                  (A  fault  in  MODEM A which was not detected during self
                  testing is  also  remotely  possible.)  After  corrective
                  action has been taken, go to STEP 13.

              8.  Terminate any loads in progress and using LOADII  or  ELF
                  start  a  load  of the file LINTST.REL from NODE B toward
                  NODE A.

              9.  If the load utility shows that data is being "lost",  you
                  have an indication that either NODE B is at fault or that
                  there is cabling problem between NODE B and MODEM B.   (A
                  fault   in   MODEM   B   which  is  not  detected  during
                  self-testing is also remotely possible.) After corrective

INTER NODAL LINK


                  action has been taken, go to STEP 13.

             10.  If no faults have been discovered thus  far,  verify  the
                  modem  end-to-end  test  by  placing  MODEM  B in DL (RT)
                  loopback.  MODEM A should be out of loopback.

             11.  Terminate any loads in progress and using LOADII or  ELF,
                  load LINTST.REL through NODE A toward NODE B.  Any "lost"
                  data will indicate a previously undetected line or  modem
                  problem.  After servicing is completed, go to STEP 14.

             12.  Take MODEM B out of loopback and place MODEM A in DL (LT)
                  loopback.

             13.  Terminate any loads in progress and using LOADII or  ELF,
                  load LINTST.REL through NODE B toward NODE A.  Any "lost"
                  data will indicate a previously undetected line or  modem
                  problem.

             14.   After  servicing  to  clear  any  faults,   verify   the
                  effectiveness  of  the  servicing by rerunning those test
                  which failed.

             15.  Take all modems out of loopback and terminate  any  loads
                  which may be in progress.

             16.  Observe the line with PROBE, XRAY  and/or  TMCS  for  any
                  further indications of trouble.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                   NON-INTERNODAL SYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION LINE



          I.  PURPOSE

                  This    procedure    describes    the    technique    for
                  trouble-shooting  a  suspected  failure  of a synchronous
                  communications line which is assigned to an ISIS slot.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. A knowledge of TYM files.
                  2. An ability to use DDT.
                  3. Access to SLSYNC.NIB or SLSIO.NIB 
                  4. Means of loading SLSYNC.NIB or SLSIO.NIB
                  5. Ability to run SLSYNC.NIB or SLSIO.NIB
                  6. Direct or indirect means of looping back modems.


          III.  PROCEDURE

            A.  For synchronous slot lines equipped with modems, proceed as
                follows:

              1.  Run a loopback test  between  the  modems  on  the  line.
                  (Return  modems  to  normal  configuration  after test is
                  completed)

              2.  If the loopback test  fails,  run  a  self  test  on  the
                  modems.   (Return  modems  to  normal configuration after
                  test is completed)

              3.  If the self tests fail, turn  the  problem  over  to  the
                  agency  responsible for the maintenance of the modems and
                  go to STEP 18.

              4.  If the self test passes, turn the  problem  over  to  the
                  appropriate  telephone  service  group and have loopbacks
                  run to the CIU's at both ends of the line.

              5.  If the loopbacks fail,  turn  the  problem  over  to  the
                  telephone service group for resolution and go to STEP 18.

SYNC LINE


              6.  Using the Node and  Slot  TYM  files  or  using  the  ?LU
                  command  in  DDT, determine if the suspect line is driven
                  by SYNC Brd or by SIO Brd hardware.

              7.  If more than one logical unit is assigned  to  the  slot,
                  use  the  Node TYM files, Slot TYM files and notes on the
                  configuration of the network to determine  which  logical
                  unit is suspect.

              8.   If  the  line  is  supported  by  SYNC  hardware,   load
                  SLSYNC.NIB into the slot.

              9.  If the line is supported by SIO hardware, load  SLSIO.NIB
                  into the slot.

             10.  Log into the slot diagnostic just loaded and  assign  the
                  suspect logical unit to the diagnostic.

             11.  Place the modem cabled to the  suspect  logical  unit  in
                  analog (line) loopback.

             12.  Start the slot diagnostic and  periodically  display  the
                  test results.

             13.  If the slot diagnostic fails, turn the  problem  over  to
                  the  appropriate  hardware  support agency and go to STEP
                  18.

             14.  If the slot diagnostic runs without error, have the modem
                  taken  out  of loopback and have the distant modem placed
                  in digital loopback.

             15.  Stop, Reset and Restart the slot diagnostic.

             16.  If the diagnostic now fails, you have either a  modem  or
                  line  problem not detected in previous testing.  Have the
                  problem cleared by the appropriate support agency and  go
                  to STEP XX.

             17.  If the diagnostic does not fail in STEP 16, the node  and
                  slot  code  should be considered suspect and the terminal
                  or host device at the end of the line should  be  checked
                  for malfunction.

             18.  Insure that the production code is loaded into  the  slot
                  and  that  the  production  code  is running.  Use DDT to
                  verify this.

             19.  Insure that loopbacks are removed from all modems.

             20.  After the problem is found and thought to  be  corrected,
                  verify with the person reporting the problem that service
                  has been restored.

SYNC LINE


            B.  For synchronous slot lines which are hard wired directly to
                user equipment, proceed as follows:

              1.  Using the Node and  Slot  TYM  files  or  using  the  ?LU
                  command  in  DDT, determine if the suspect line is driven
                  by SYNC Brd or by SIO Brd hardware.

              2.  If more than one logical unit is assigned  to  the  slot,
                  use  the  Node TYM files, Slot TYM files and notes on the
                  configuration of the network to determine  which  logical
                  unit is suspect.

              3.   If  the  line  is  supported  by  SYNC  hardware,   load
                  SLSYNC.NIB into the slot.

              4.  If the line is supported by SIO hardware, load  SLSIO.NIB
                  into the slot.

              5.  Log into the slot diagnostic just loaded and  assign  the
                  suspect logical unit to the diagnostic.

              6.  Discount the user equipment and place a breakout  box  in
                  the  circuit  so  that  date  and  control signals can be
                  looped back towards the engine.

                  a.  Jumper the breakout box as follows:
                              TD Pin to RD Pin
                              RTS Pin to CTS Pin
                              DCD Pin to DSR Pin to DTR Pin

                  b.  Check the breakout box to see if transmit and receive
                      clocks  are  still  available.   If they are missing,
                      they must be reacquired before proceeding.

              7.  Start the slot diagnostic and  periodically  display  the
                  test results.

              8.  If the slot diagnostic fails, turn the  problem  over  to
                  the  appropriate  hardware  support agency and go to STEP
                  10.

              9.  If the diagnostic does not fail, the node and  slot  code
                  should  be  considered  suspect  and the terminal or host
                  device at the end of  the  line  should  be  checked  for
                  malfunction.

             10.  Insure that the production code is loaded into  the  slot
                  and  that  the  production  code  is running.  Use DDT to
                  verify this.

             11.  Insure that loopbacks are removed from all modems.

             12.  After the problem is found and thought to  be  corrected,
                  verify with the person reporting the problem that service
                  has been restored.


               COMMENTS:

                  When SLSYNC.NIB or SLSIO.NIB is loaded into  a  slot  all
                  production service in that slot is interrupted.  However,
                  there is no interruption to the service provided by other
                  slots within the machine.

          I.  PURPOSE

                  This procedure describes the process  by  which  existing
                  circuits may be traced through a TYMNET-II network.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  Access to XRAY and/or PROBE
                  2.  Access to DDT


          III.  PROCEDURE

              I.  Tracing a Circuit from a Stand-Alone Tymsat

                  1.  Determine the port number in the  Stand-Alone  Tymsat
                      where the circuit originates.

                       NOTE:  Three  methods  exist  for  determining   the
                             origination   port  number  in  a  Stand-Alone
                             Tymsat.   Use  any  one   of   the   following
                             techniques:

                        1.  Obtain the origination port number (in  decimal
                            form)  from  the  login string displayed on the
                            terminal.

                            Example:    Please    type    your     terminal
                                        identifier
                                        -2300-263-
                                        please log in:

                            The origination  port  number  is  263  (Octal)
                            which converts to 179 (Decimal).

                        2.  Use the XRAY command, AS  U,  before  the  user
                            logs  in and again immediately after he logs in
                            to detect the port on which he has landed.  The
                            port  number  will be displayed in Octal in the
                            PORT field of the  XRAY  output.   Convert  the

CIRCUIT TRACING


                            Octal port number to its Decimal equivalent.

                            Example:    Prior to login----

                              0001 PORTS IN USE OUT OF 256 -------->
                              PORT RLA DTR DSR RTS CP DPLX -------->
                              0210 FF  FF  FF  00  FF 00   -------->

                            Example:    After Login----

                              0002 PORTS IN USE OUT OF 256 -------->
                              PORT RLA DTR DSR RTS CP DPLX -------->
                              0210 FF  FF  FF  00  FF 00   -------->
                              0263 FF  FF  FF  00  FF 00   -------->

                              XRAY indicates that port number 263  appeared
                              after  the  login.  The Octal number 263 then
                              is converted to its Decimal equivalent, 179.

                        3.  Use the PROBE command PSTAT immediately  before
                            and  immediately after the login to display the
                            origination port number.  (The  PSTAT  response
                            will  display  the  port  number in its Decimal
                            form.)

                            Example:    Prior to login----

                              PSTAT 2300 H0 0                    <--Command
                              HOST 0 PORT ARRAY 0   5 6 18 23 55 <--Response
                              PSTAT 2300 H0 1                    <--Command
                              HOST 0 PORT ARRAY 1   173 181      <--Response

                            Example:    After login----

                              PSTAT 2300 H0 0                    <--Command
                              HOST 0 PORT ARRAY 0   5 18 23 55   <--Response
                              PSTAT 2300 H0 1                    <--Command
                              HOST 0 PORT ARRAY 1   173 179 181  <--Response

                              Notice that after the login  Port  6  dropped
                              but  that  was not of consequence to us.  But
                              also   notice   that   Port   179    appeared
                              coincidentally  with the login so Port 179 is
                              the origination port number.

                  2.  Perform the circuit trace using Probe TRACE command.

                            Example:

                            TRACE 2300 H1706 179                  <--Command
                            HOST 1706 PORT 179 2300 2315 2034 HOST 1897 PORT 1

CIRCUIT TRACING


                            The Probe response to the  TRACE  command  will
                            then  display the circuit as it exists from the
                            origination port to the termination port.

              II.  Tracing a Circuit from an ISIS Slot Port

                  If a circuit originates in at a port assigned to an  ISIS
                  slot, the path from the port to the network is:

                            1.  From the user port to the slot's dispatcher
                                port.
                            2.  From the dispatcher port to Slot  0's  port
                                into the network.

                  The internal ISIS circuit path is  depicted  below.   The
                  diagram  also  shows the port numbers which the DDT query
                  ?CT will return when the query is made in  the  interface
                  slot, Slot X, and in the node slot, Slot 0.

                     ..............                    ..............
                     :  Slot X    :    Dispatcher      :  Slot 0    :
                     :            :                    :            :
          USER<---->Px<------------------------------------------->Pz<--->NETWORK
                     :............:                    :............:

                     ^                                             ^
                     |                                             |
                     |<--------------?CT from Slot X-------------->|
                     |               yield Px and Pz               | 
                      Where:    Px = User Port Number
                                Pz = Network Port Number

                  The tracing method recommended  below  is  not  the  most
                  efficient means of doing a trace because it presumes that
                  the USER's port number is not known or if the port number
                  is  known,  it  is  presumed  that  the  port  cannot  be
                  correlated with the Dispatcher Port Number.

                      1.  Determine the Dispatcher port number at the  port
                          of origination of the circuit.

                          1.  Log into DDT in the slot from which the  user
                              circuit  will  be  originating  and  type ?CT
                              before the user circuit is built.

                          2.  After the user circuit is built, again  enter
                              the DDT query ?CT from the origination slot.

                            Example: Response to ?CT before login:

                              PORT  1---->s4:2E
                              PORT  2---->s0:10
                              PORT  F---->s4:1D

CIRCUIT TRACING


                              Example: Response to ?CT after login:

                              PORT  1---->s4:2E
                              PORT  2---->s0:10
                              PORT  5---->s0:0E
                              PORT  F---->s4:1D

                              Notice that Port 5 came active coincidentally
                              with the login.

                                  In the Example then:

                                    The USER Port Number = 5 (Hex)

                                    The Dispatcher Port Number = 0E (Hex)

                          3.  Convert the Hexidecimal Network  Port  Number
                              to  its  decimal  equivalent  and perform the
                              network circuit trace using the Probe command
                              TRACE.

                            Example: It was  determined  that  the  Network
                                        Port  Number  is  equal to 0E which
                                        converts to a Decimal Network  Port
                                        Number of 14.

                              TRACE 2041 H56 14                  <--Command
                              HOST 56 PORT 14 2041 2020 2063 HOST 345 PORT 6

                               Note: In the TRACE command the node number (2041)
                                     and  the  host  number  associated with the
                                     circuit  (56)  was  used  along  with   the
                                     Decimal Network Port Number (14).

                                     If  no  host  number  is  associated   with
                                     origination  point  in  the  circuit  being
                                     traced the host number 0 can be used.

                                  SECURITY BREACH



          I.  PURPOSE

                  To determine what data is being sent to the supervisor on
                  a  command  circuit  for a login that is being flagged as
                  garbage or as a security violation.


          II.  SCOPE

                  Many bad login attempts are caused by  poor  Async  data.
                  This  data  is  garbled by the communication equipment on
                  the engine.  This procedure helps determine which.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.   Log  into  XRAY  on  the  effected  node  with  a  super
                  privileged name.

              2.  Set license in XRAY.

              3.  Issue a "TD 20" command with a printer turned on.   ("20"
                  represents  the  sup  command port.  It will always be 20
                  and 21.)

              4.  Issue a "TA 20" command with the printer turned on.

              5.  Issue a second "TA 20" command.

              6.  Look at the data for login request and the username.   If
                  the name is readable, someone or program may be trying to
                  get in.

                  Many times the data will be garbage.   The  "TA"  command
                  displays  ASCII  characters  for  the bit patterns.  This
                  data may cause your terminal to do unpredictable things.

                  NOTE: The XRAY logic will not display passwords.  No  one
                         can  get  to  them.   This command does not pose a
                         security problem.

SECURITY BREACH


              7.  If you see garbage, halt and restart  the  node  or  slot
                  (whichever  is  applicable).   When  DTR is present on an
                  Async terminal port during initialization,  the  port  is
                  hung  on  startup.   If the garbage continues immediately
                  after  the  start,  then  Tymnet   hardware   should   be
                  suspected.

              8.  If the problem does not reappear, then terminal equipment
                  is suspect.

                                 PASSWORD SECURITY



          I.  PURPOSE

                  To establish the necessary attitude needed to insure  the
                  integrity of our network access.


          II.  DEFINITIONS

                  Password - A collection of characters numbering at  least
                  seven  (7)  and  not more than twenty (20).  At least one
                  non-alpha character will be embedded in  the  collection.
                  A semi-colon or a control-M may not be used.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              1.  All passwords will be  routinely  changed  on  the  first
                  Monday of each month.

              2.  In the event that personnel, who had access to passwords,
                  leave  the  organization,  passwords  to  which  they had
                  access will be changed within the ensuing eight hours.

              3.  When personnel leave an  organization  the  unit  manager
                  will  cancel  any  individual  user  names,  or  operator
                  license the person had  sole  access  to.   If  the  unit
                  manager  is  unavailable, then the next available manager
                  will be notified of the required changes.

              4.  Passwords will not be transmitted via printed media.

              5.  Passwords will not be disseminated beyond  organizational
                  limits   except   by  the  approval  of  the  controlling
                  organization's manager.

              6.  Records of license and password access granted  to  every
                  individual will be maintained.

                             SHIFT TURNOVER PROCEDURES



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The procedure outlines some of the processes by which  an
                  orderly  transfer of responsibility between shifts can be
                  effected.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. A Shift Turnover Form.
                  2. Access to TMCS
                  3. A Trouble Log or Trouble Ticket System.


          III.  OVERVIEW

                  The purpose of a Shift Turnover procedure is to  make  it
                  possible  for  one  network  operations  shift to replace
                  another shift with  the  least  possible  impact  on  the
                  operation  of  the network.  The principal aspects of the
                  turnover are:

                      1.  Shift Turnover Forms  filled  out  by  operations
                          specialists.
                      2.  A Problem Log or Ticket System.
                      3.  A review of TMCS and/or PROBE indications of  the
                          network's health.
                      4.  A  verbal  briefing  given  by  the  shift  being
                          relieved.


          IV.  PROCEDURE

                  1.  During the course of shift, it  will  become  obvious
                      that  certain activities will not be completed during
                      the shift.  Personnel  should  make  notations  on  a
                      Shift  Turnover  Form relative to such activities and
                      should provide sufficient information  for  the  next
                      shift to take any necessary action.

SHIFT TURNOVER


                      a.  During the process of the actual shift  turnover,
                          the Shift Turnover forms should be collected from
                          the existing shift personnel and turned  over  to
                          the   new   shift's   personnel  for  review  and
                          subsequent action.

                      b.  If  the  shift  going  off  duty  received  Shift
                          Turnover  Forms  from  the  shift it replaced and
                          some items on those forms have not been resolved,
                          those forms should also be turned over to the new
                          shift.

                      c.  Once completed, all Shift Turnover  Forms  should
                          be kept on file for one week.

                  2.  A review of  Trouble  Log  entries  or  open  Trouble
                      Tickets  should  be conducted between the old and new
                      shifts to:

                      a.  Bring outtages to the attention of the new shift.

                      b.  Make the new shift aware of any  difficulties  in
                          getting existing problems cleared.

                      c.  Prevent duplication of effort.

                      d.  Preclude  the  possibility  of  a  problem  being
                          allowed to go unresolved.

                  3.  The new shift should cross check the NODE,  HOST  and
                      LINE  OUTTAGES  reported  by TMCS against the current
                      Trouble Log or against the open  Trouble  Tickets  to
                      ascertain  that  all  existing  anomalies  are  being
                      addressed.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                             MUX IN NETWORK OPERATIONS



          I.  PURPOSE

                  The  ability  to  have  a  single  terminal  logged  into
                  multiple  hosts  and  utilities is essential to a network
                  operations group.  Another feature of the Tymnet  MUX  is
                  its  ability  to  be  used  as  a realtime communications
                  device.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1. MUX slot and access to the MUX.
                  2. MUX code of version 4.00 or later.


          III.  GENERAL INFORMATION 

              1.  When usernames are "genned" into the MUX slot code,  both
                  LABELING and HEAR parameters should be specified.

              2.  A sufficient number of names should be "genned" into  the
                  MUX code and validated on the network for the MUX host so
                  that all network operators have access to the MUX.

              3.   In  the  following  procedures  (ESC)   represents   the
                  depression of the ESCAPE key.


          IV.  PROCEDURE

              A.  Using the MUX for Multiple Host and/or Utility Logins:

                  1.  Log into the MUX

                  2.  At the MUX prompt, type: M xxxxxxxx

                             (where xxxxxxxx = a label you  would  like  to
                              assign to the port being used for the circuit
                              that is about to be built)

                                                    PAGE 101
MUX


                  3.  At the "PLEASE LOG IN" prompt,  you  proceed  with  a
                      normal login process appropriate for the desired host
                      or utility.

                  4.  To return to the MUX command level, type: (ESC)Z

                  5.  If you wish to build another circuit, go  to  STEP  2
                      again.  

                  6.  To transfer from a terminal circuit and return to the
                      MUX command level, you simply type: (ESC)Z .

                  7.  To transfer from the MUX command level to an existing
                      circuit,  simply  type:  S xxxxxxx (xxxxxxx = circuit
                      label, see STEP 2).

                  8.  To backpressure a circuit, you must have the terminal
                      currently  connected to the circuit and there must be
                      at least one other circuit built.

                      a.  Then simply type (ESC)B and the circuit to  which
                          your  terminal is connected will be backpressured
                          and your terminal will transferred  to  the  next
                          circuit.

                      b.  To release backpressure, you need  only  transfer
                          back   into  the  backpressured  port  by  either
                          transferring to that port from  the  MUX  command
                          level  or  by  transferring  to  it  from another
                          circuit by typing (ESC)B or (ESC)G .

                  9.  If circuits are not backpressured,  any  output  from
                      those  ports  will  be  labeled  and displayed on the
                      terminal.  It is possible to display the output of  a
                      running  logger,  for instance, while also displaying
                      the output of a code loading facility such as  LOADII
                      or  ELF.  You can, therefore, watch the load proceed,
                      know when  the  load  ends  and  observe  the  logger
                      indications  of  the  node  and/or  slot's  return to
                      service.

              B.   Using  the  MUX  for   Direct   Terminal   to   Terminal
                  Communications

                  1.   If  a  network  is  spread  out  around  the  world,
                      communications  costs  related  to network operations
                      can be reduced by utilizing the MUX's TALK  and  HEAR
                      capabilities.

                  2.  If you have need to communicate with  someone,  type:
                      WHO at the MUX's command level.

MUX


                  3.  If the user with whom you desire  to  communicate  is
                      logged in proceed as follows:

                      a.  At the MUX command level prompt, type: HEAR ON

                      b.  Again at the MUX command level prompt, type: TALK
                          xxxxxxx

                             (where  xxxxxxx  =   user   name   with   whom
                              communications must be established)

                      c.  Everything you type will now  be  transferred  to
                          the  desired  user  as soon as you terminate your
                          input with a carriage return.

                      d.  As soon as the other user performs STEP B.3.a and
                          STEP B.3.b, whatever he types will be transferred
                          to your terminal when he types a carriage return.

                      e.  To terminate the session, (ESC)Z should be typed.
                          The  output of your terminal will now be directed
                          back to the command level within the MUX and  the
                          other  user  will no longer receive your terminal
                          output.

                      f.  The other user  should  perform  STEP  IV.8.e  to
                          terminate  his  session  with  you.  You may type
                          HEAR OFF if you wish to discontinue your  receipt
                          of his message before he terminates the session.

                           NETWORK OPERATIONS PROCEDURES


                          USING TYMCOM OPERATIONS MANAGER



          I.  PURPOSE

                  To use TOM to check on a port's status, to put a port  in
                  or out of service.


          II.  REQUIREMENTS

                  1.  Access to TOM  via  hardwired  port  or  through  the
                      network.
                  2.  Status for LEVEL 1 commands.


          III.  PROCEDURE

              I.  To check a port's status.

                  1.  Log into TOM.
                  2.  All prompts are the symbol '>'.
                  3.  Type in "ST P #" to check  status  of  an  individual
                      port.
                  4.  Type in "ST P #-#" to check a range of ports.
                  5.  Type in "ST P" to check status of all the ports.
                  6.  TOM will list the port numbers  and  the  status  for
                      each  port requested.  The status is indicated by the
                      following letters: U,D,S,A,V.
                      U = UP, D = DOWN, S = SHUT, A = ACTIVE, V = VESTIGIAL
                      Active indicates that the port is up and  circuit  to
                      it  exists.   Vestigial  indicates  that the port has
                      been shut but still has an active circuit.

              II.  To UP or DOWN a  port,  ie.   put  them  in  or  out  of
                  service.

                  1.  Log into TOM.

                  3.  Type "GRAB ######",  with  ######  being  the  change
                      license password.
                  4.  The user will now have the status to  up  or  down  a

USING TOM


                      one port.
                  6.  Type "UP P #-#" or "DOWN P #-#" to change the  status
                      of a range of ports.
                  7.  The DOWN command  will  cause  current  users  to  be
                      dropped when it is issued.
                  8.  The "SHUT" command may be used in the same way.  This
                      will  not  affect  current users but will prevent the
                      port from being available for future assignments.
