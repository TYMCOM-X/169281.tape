                                 INTRODUCTION

         VALMENU is an ontyme validation program designed to replace
         the TI-129 form. The objective of VALMENU is to improve the
         speed of  the internal validation system.  The user of this
         program is  to establish  new usernames and initialize  all
         changes, deletions and additions to existing usernames.

         Documentation  for VALMENU is written in  a manner which is
         easy to follow.  A  description  and an example is provided
         for each command. All entries displayed by Ontyme are shown
         in uppercase  form and information  provided for each entry
         is shown in lowercase form.

         The  following list  contains the  items  that are  covered
         within this documentation.
