.BLANK
.BLANK
1VALCONTROL-this examines all requests entered for the pdp10 and 940 systems.
.blank
370VALCONTROL-this examines all requests entered for the ibm370 systems.
.BLANK
EXAMINE-(this may be shortened to "ex")this command types out all entered

information and allows the user to change most items.  every request must
be examined before it can be processed.  this command may be followed by
a request number (when you'd like to examine a particular request) or a
carriage return to signify "all".  this will ask you if there are any
items to change,type "n" for no, and also if this request is ready to be
processed, type "y" for yes.
.BLANK
AUTO-this types out the heading for a special class of requests then marks
them ready for processing.
.BLANK
PROCESS ALL-this outputs information from each request to a command file
so that the request may be carried out.  the command may be followed by
a number when you'd like to put one request in its own file to expedite
quickly.
.BLANK
WAIT-asked on completion of exam if request is not ready to be processed.
when the program asks if this request is ready to be processed,you would
type "n",it will then ask "wait?",type "y". the request will be set in
wait status and will not appear again until a re-examine is done.
.blank
RE-EXAMINE-this types out all entered information for requests which have
been set to wait status. allows changes for most items. the command may
be followed by a number for a specified request or by a carriage
return to signify all. if "n" is entered in reply to "ready to be processed?"
then the user will be asked for "wait" again. if user enters "y",request
will still be set for wait. if user enters "n", the wait status will
return to "to be examined".

that have already been processed. the command is followed by a request
number.

followed by a request number. only billable (customer) requests can be
put through these programs, if you see a non-billable request, or a 
district user name,go ahead and finish examining the request, and at
the * type "remove #(request number). the "bad" requests
are then removed, but you'd want to keep the request with the
removal request stapled together,for future reference in case these
users call, and would like to know why the request was removed.
