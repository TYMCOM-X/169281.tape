private network hosts. All Tymcom systems (PDP10 and IBM370) are
monitored on color monitors that display and update information
on each systems performance/usage. Detailed statistics are
gathered daily, the data is analyzed, and the findings are
summarized into a monthly report.

     This report was customized for Gary Walker. When compared to
the prior months data, differences can be used for measurement of
growth, indicate excessive usage levels and by whom, etc..


     I have reports that date back several years, there are also
colored plots that can be made to display several types of data
comparisons such as:

     * Prime Time vs. Non-Prime Time TRU usage (a TRU is a Tymshare
       Resource Unit which is used for billing purposes)

     * Monthly CPU levels - a 12-month line chart
       (CPU stands for Central Processing Unit) 

     * Primary Public Network Host vs. Back-up Host 


     These are just a few examples, and are very helpful in
forecasting system usage. 

      If you need any item on the report defined, I'd be more
than happy to provide any additional information upon request.
