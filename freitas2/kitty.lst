                           -------------------


     INTRODUCTION

     1validate and 370validate are programs specifically designed for use
     by  the  field  offices  to establish newly acquired accounts and to
     initialize  all  changes,  deletions,  and  additions  for  existing
     customers.


     VALIDATIONS STAFF THEN EXAMINES THE REQUESTS SUBMITTED BY THE  FIELD
     OFFICE   THROUGH  '1VALCONTROL'  AND  '370VALCONTROL'  ON  SYSTEM  1
     (TYMSHARE  REQUESTS),  AND  '370VALCONTROL'  ON  SYSTEM  16  (TYMNET
     REQUESTS).   WHEN  THE  REQUESTS  HAVE BEEN EXAMINED IT IS PROCESSED
     INTO A COMMAND FILE WHICH, WHEN RUN, COMPLETES THE REQUESTS.

     VALIDATION TERMS


     1VALCONTROL-this examines all requests entered for the pdp10 and 940
     systems.

     370VALCONTROL-this examines all  requests  entered  for  the  ibm370
     systems.

     EXAMINE-(this may be shortened to "ex")this command  types  out  all
     entered information and allows the user to change most items.  every
     request must be examined before it can be processed.   this  command
     may  be  followed  by a request number (when you'd like to examine a
     particular request) or a carriage return  to  signify  "all".   this
     will  ask  you if there are any items to change,type "n" for no, and
     also if this request is ready to be processed, type "y" for yes.

     AUTO-this types out the heading for a special class of requests then
     marks them ready for processing.

     PROCESS ALL-this outputs information from each request to a  command
     file  so  that  the  request may be carried out.  the command may be
     followed by a number when you'd like to put one request in  its  own
     file to expedite quickly.

     WAIT-asked on completion of exam if  request  is  not  ready  to  be
     processed.   when  the  program  asks if this request is ready to be
     processed,you would type "n",it will then ask "wait?",type "y".  the
     request will be set in wait status and will not appear again until a
     re-examine is done.

     RE-EXAMINE-this types out all entered information for requests which
     have  been  set to wait status.  allows changes for most items.  the
     command may be followed by a number for a specified request or by  a
     carriage  return  to  signify  all.   if  "n" is entered in reply to
     "ready to be processed?" then the user  will  be  asked  for  "wait"
     again.   if  user enters "y",request will still be set for wait.  if

                                                                 PAGE   2



     user enters "n", the wait status will return to "to be examined".

     NEEDS EXAMINE-types all request numbers that are entered,  but  have
     not been examined as yet.

     NEEDS RE-EXAMINE-types all request numbers  that  are  entered,  but
     have been set for wait status.

     NEEDS PROCESS-types all request numbers that are examined, but  have
     not been processed as yet.

     NEEDS ANSWER-types all request numbers that have been processed, but
     have not been answered as yet.  this should be ran when there are to
     your  knowledge  no  outstanding  requests  as  sometimes  they  are
     overlooked.  you then would research, and answer them.

     REPROCESS-processes a single request.   this  command  is  used  for
     requests  that have already been processed.  the command is followed
     by a request number.

     REMOVE-allows the user to delete  a  request  from  the  file.   the
     command  is  followed by a request number.  only billable (customer)
     requests  can  be  put  through  these  programs,  if  you   see   a
     non-billable  request,  or  a district user name,go ahead and finish
     examining the request, and at the * type "remove  (request  number).
     the  "bad"  requests  are  then  removed, but you'd want to keep the
     request  with  the  removal  request  stapled  together,for   future
     reference  in  case these users call, and would like to know why the
     request was removed.

     HELP-types all possible commands

     ALL REQUESTS-types all requests from the file.  an  output  file  is
     requested and if "t" is used, output will go to the terminal.

     ALL ERRORS-types one  request  to  the  terminal.   the  command  is
     followed by a request number.

     QUIT-exits to the exec.


     FORMAT


     this section instructs you on  how  to  access  to  the  validations
     program  and  succesfully complete the requests.  there are examples
     to reference to and also other information that  you  will  need  to
     know.    uppercase  letters  reflect  what  you  the  program  types
     out,lowercase letters reflect what you are to type in.

     you'd want to start at the end and tear toward  the  top,laying  the
     requests  on  top of each other as you go,this will put the requests
     in numerical order then the auto  file,  and  process  all  goes  on
     top,put   together   with   a   paper  clip.the  command  file  (ex:
     150ctupda)should be on top for easy access.  now you're ready to key
     the necessary input to process the requests.

     *****NOTE:*****
     WHEN PROCESSING A FILE WITH REQUESTS EXAMINED IN '370VALCONTROL' THE
     PROGRAM  WILL  ASK IF YOU'D LIKE TO SET PACK FOR ANY REQUEST IN THIS
     FILE? TYPE 'N' FOR NO.  SOME CUSTOMERS  HAVE  DEDICATED  PACKS  USED
     SOLELY  BY THEIR COMPANY.  USERS UNDER THESE ACCOUNTS MUST BE PLACED
     ONE OF THESE PACKS.  DETERMINE THE PACK LABEL THEY ARE ASSIGNED  TO,
     AND  IN THESE CASES YOU WOULD TYPE 'Y' FOR YES WHEN THE PROGRAM ASKS
     IF YOU'D LIKE TO SET PACK.  WHEN IT COMES TO THE REQUEST TO SET PACK
     TO,  YOU  MUST  ENTER THE PACK LABEL.(WHEN THE REQUESTS ARE ENTERED,
     THE BRANCH WILL CALL WITH THE REQUEST NUMBER AND PACK LABEL.)

     THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO KEY IN, THE COMPUTER WILL THEN  ANSWER  THESE
     REQUESTS.  BY ITSELF.

     WHEN THIS IS DONE, ADVANCE THE PAPER TILL THE PRINTING IS  PAST  THE
     CLEAR WINDOW AND TEAR, AGAIN YOU'D WANT TO START AT THE END AND TEAR
     TOWARD THE TOP, LAYING THE REQUESTS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AS YOU  DID
     BEFORE,  MATCH  THE  REQUEST  NUMBERS  UP  WITH  THE  ONES  THAT ARE
     COMPLETED, AND STAPLE TOGETHER PUTTING THE ACTUAL REQUEST ON TOP AND
     THE  ANSWERED  REQUEST  ON THE BOTTOM.  SOMETIMES THERE ARE REQUESTS
     WITH ERRORS ON THEM, AND THOSE WILL SAY "THIS REQUEST HAS  NOT  BEEN
     ANSWERED" YOU MUST THEN FIND THE ERROR NUMBER THAT MATCHES THE ERROR
     AND GO BACK INTO '1VALCONTROL' OR '370VALCONTROL' (WHICHEVER APPLIES
     TO THAT REQUEST'S SYSTEM TYPE)


     ERROR MESSAGES

     after  a  request  has  been  processed  and  the  file   has   been
     deleted,some  requests  are  still  not  answered,  these have to be
     answered manually, following IS A  LIST  OF  ALL  VALIDATIONS  ERROR
     NUMBERS  AND  THE  ERROR MESSAGE.  find the error number write it on
     the request,go into the program in which the request waS entered and
     type  ANSWER  (REQ. ), THE PROGRAM WILL type out who entered and ask
     if this is the same request, then the first command of  the  request
     will  type  out  and ask if there are any errors, if yes the program
     will ask for the error number,once you have typed THE NUMBER  IN  IT
     WILL GIVE YOU THE CORRESPONDING ERROR MESSAGE, IF IT is correct type
     "y" for okay.

     they  have submitted a request to establish a new ktl customer.  the
     following statement should be under the comments section:

     set up a customer as a tymuse customer not receiving  his  own  data
     but  sending  it to customer 15898 (tymktl).  do not install schema.
     validate on host 23 **and** 34, using 23 as the home system.

     separate commands file.  run the file as soon as possible.

     3)when the new user is established, submit a request in 1validate to
     "add user" to sys.  34.  examine and process your request.

     4)reenter 1validate and submit a request to "set tymuse".  note:  do
     not set tymuse schema.  examine and process your request.
