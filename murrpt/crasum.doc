		     ------------------------------
		    (Written 07/18/84 by D. Baigent)


INTRODUCTION:
------------
	The CRASH.SUMMARY report is generated on a daily basis in the
MURRPT directory on system 55.  The report contains a summary of all
unscheduled crashes for each TYMSHARE host sorted by the system type
(CLASS), the system location (SITE), and the system number (SYSNO).  The
report provides totals for the number of crashes for each system, the
number crashes for each SITE and the total number of crashes for each
CLASS of system.  The report also calculates the availability of each
system, expressed as a percent of scheduled up time, and provides this
figure for each system as well as a summary of availability for each
SITE and CLASS.

	The daily CRASH.SUMMARY reports are output to two files in the
MURRPT directory on system 55.  The "CSL.RPT" file contains a summary of
crashes for each valid CLASS and SITE for the previous month.  The "CS.RPT"
file contains a summary of all crashes for each valid CLASS and SITE for
the current month up to the date the report is generated.  Alternately,
those users that are valid in the MUR data base can run CRASH.SUMMARY
manually and specify the date range, CLASS and/or SITE they wish in the
report.  Contact the MUR data base administrator if there are any
questions on how to run CRASH.SUMMARY manually.

THE CRASH.SUMMARY FORMAT:
------------------------
	Once the CRASH.SUMMARY report file is created, it can be printed
on a hardcopy terminal by typing "TYPE FILENAME" at the EXEC level,
where "FILENAME" is the CRASH.SUMMARY report file.  (For example, typing
"TYPE CSL.RPT" followed by a carriage return would type the report in
the MURRPT directory).  The following is a desciption of the
CRASH.SUMMARY report format, please refer to the example copy at the end
of this document (EXAMPLE OUTPUT:)...

1)  A page heading is supplied at the top of each page as follows:

CRASH SUMMARY FOR Mmm DD, YYYY TO Mmm DD, YYYY AS OF Mmm DD, YYYY HH:MM

Where "Mmm DD, YYYY TO Mmm DD, YYYY" is the beginning and ending dates
for the report and "AS OF Mmm DD, YYYY HH:MM" is the date and time the
report was generated (see line (1) in EXAMPLE OUTPUT:).  Each page is
defined as 66 lines long.

2)  Each CLASS of systems has a heading that includes an abbreviation of
the system type, the abbreviations of the various crash code titles and
headings for the columns that will contain the totals, availability
percentages and the last date that data was entered for each system.
(see line (2) in EXAMPLE OUTPUT:)

(NOTE: A description of the various crash code abbreviations, along with
all other CRASH.SUMMARY abbreviations will be disscussed later in this
document.  The asterisks in the header indicate crash codes that are not
calculated in the adjusted availability percentage, also to be discussed
later.)

3)  After the CLASS heading, a detail line is printed for each system of
the current SITE.  Under the system type abbreviation in the header is
the appropriate system number followed by the number of crashes for each
of the various crash codes.
  
    Under the "TOT" heading will be the total number of crashes for that
system followed by the calculated availability percentage under the
"AVAIL" heading.  (How this figure is calculated will be discussed
later).

    Under the "DATE" heading will be the last date that data was entered
into the data base for that system in the format "MMDD".  If the date in
this column is prior to the ending date for the report, data effecting
the output of the report has not yet been entered into the data base, and
the presented figures may be inaccurate.
(see line (3) in EXAMPLE OUTPUT:)

(NOTE: An asterisk in between the "AVAIL" figure and the "DATE" figure
indicates a system that is not calculated in the adjusted CLASS summary
discussed later.)

4)  When all the systems of the current CLASS for the current SITE have
been outputted, CRASH.SUMMARY provides a summary line for the current
SITE.  Under the system type heading will be the abbreviation of the
current SITE followed by the total number of crashes for each of the
various crash codes.

   Under the "TOT" heading will be the total number of all crashes for
the current SITE followed by the availability of the current CLASS of
systems for that SITE under the "AVAIL" heading.

   Under the "DATE" heading will be a figure that represents the average
number of crashes per system for the current SITE.  (This figure is
calculated by dividing the total number of crashes by the number of
systems of the current CLASS for the particular SITE.)
(see line (4) in EXAMPLE OUTPUT:)

5)  The line following the SITE summary is the adjusted summary for the
current SITE as indicated by the asterisk under the SITE abbreviation.
This line provides the adjusted number of crashes, the adjusted
availability and the adjusted crashes per system under the "TOT",
"AVAIL" and "DATE" headings, respectively.  These totals do not take
into account those crashes that are considered "exempt" from the system
reliability rating as indicated by the asterisks in the CLASS heading.
(see line (5) in EXAMPLE OUTPUT:)  More on adjusted reliability later.

6)  Once all the valid SITEs for the current CLASS have been reported,
CRASH.SUMMARY will print a CLASS summary as indicated by the "TOT"
abbreviation under the system type heading.  This line contains the
total number of crashes for the current CLASS for each of the various
crash codes in the CLASS heading.  The "TOT", "AVAIL" and "DATE" columns
contain the total number of crashes, availability and average crashes
per system for the current CLASS in the same format as the SITE
summary line.
(see line (6) in EXAMPLE OUTPUT:)

7)  After the CLASS summary line is the adjusted summary for the current
CLASS as indicated by the asterisk directly under the "TOT"
abbreviation.  This line is in the same format as the adjusted summary
for each SITE described above.
(see line (7) in EXAMPLE OUTPUT:)

8)  At the end of the report, CRASH.SUMMARY provides group totals for
each type of crash code.  The various crash codes are grouped by type in
the following manner:

CPU:    All CPU related crashes 
MEM:    All memory related crashes
DSK:	All disk related crashes
I/O:	All input-output (peripheral) related crashes
OHW:	All crashes caused by other types of host hardware
SSW:	All system software related crashes
OSW:	All crashes caused by other types of host software
NWK:	All network hardware and/or software related crashes
PER:	All crashes caused by personnel error
PWR:	All crashes caused by public utility power failures
ENV:	All crashes caused by environmental factors
P/E:	All crashes caused by inhouse power equipment failures
UNK:	All undetermined (unknown) crashes
OLT:	Other Lost Time (crashes not belonging to any of the above)

The report will first print the group totals (the first line under the
GRP abbreviation that starts with "TOT") followed by the percentage of
crashes attributed to each of the crash code groups.  For example, in
the EXAMPLE OUTPUT, the lines following the (8) indicate that 17 crashes,
or 20% of all the crashes for this report were caused by CPU errors, 13%
by memory errors, 17% by disk errors, etc.  Under the "TOT", "AVAIL" and
"CPS" headings are the values for the total number of crashes (87),
the total system availability (99.5%) and the average number of crashes
per system (1.9) for the entire report.

9)  The final two lines of the CRASH.SUMMARY report (line (9) and the
line following it) show the adjusted group totals for the report.  The
first line adjusts for exempt codes and the second line adjusts for exempt
codes and exempt systems.  (see the description of availability 
adjustments later in this document)


THE AVAILABILITY PERCENTAGES:
----------------------------
	Each of TYMSHARE's hosts has a timesharing schedule that
determines how many hours of the day a host is supposed to be available
for timesharing.  This schedule is used to establish the time of day
that a host may be taken off-line to perform routine or scheduled
preventative maintenance or to perform other functions, such as
accounting routines, that require the host to be free of timesharing
users.

	This schedule is expressed as a start and stop time for
timesharing hours on a 24 hour clock.  For example, if the hours for
preventative maintenance were to be from midnight to three o'clock in
the morning, the schedule for the system would be expressed as
0300-2400.

	This means that the system would have a total of 21 hours of
"scheduled up time" that it was to be available for timesharing.  If a
crash occurs during the scheduled up time, this is considered "lost
time" for the host, and the amount of time the system is unavailable due
to the crash is subtracted from the host's total availability.  

	When CRASH.SUMMARY is run, the program determines how many hours
the system has in "scheduled up time" according to its schedule and how
many hours of "lost time" the system has according to the data entered
into the MUR data base by operations.  The program then divides the
host's total availability (scheduled up time - lost time) by the host's
scheduled availability and prints the result as a percentage of
scheduled up time that the system was actually available.  Therefore, an
availability percentage of 99.8 would mean that the particular host was
available 99.8% of the time it was scheduled to be available during the
given date preiod.


THE SUMMARY ADJUSTMENTS:
-----------------------
	When calculating the adjusted crash totals, availability
percentages and crash-per-system figures for the adjusted SITE summary
line described above, CRASH.SUMMARY does not take into account those crash
codes defined as "exempt".  These include crashes that considered beyond
the control of TYMSHARE and its system support personnel, such as
crashes due to public power failures, environmental phenomenae such as
earthquakes and floods, or software field testing.  The amount of time a
system is down due to these "exempt" causes are not calculated into the
adjusted availability percentages.  The "exempt" codes are indicated by
an asterisk preceding their abbreviation in the CLASS heading.

	Additionally, some entire systems are designated as "field test
systems" and are not taken into account in the calculation of the
adjusted crash totals, availability percentages and crashes-per-system
figures for the adjusted CLASS summary lines.  These systems are used for
the testing of new system software, such as developmental operating systems
or network interfacing, and are not considered as valid, customer-oriented
timesharing hosts.  Their downtime, therefore, is not calculated into
the adjusted CLASS summary figures.  The "field test systems" are
indicated by an asterisk between the availability percentage and date
figures on the system's detail line.


THE ABBREVIATIONS:
-----------------

1: THE CLASS ABBREVIATIONS:
	Each host belongs to a certain CLASS of system, depending on the
manufacturer and/or type of the system's hardware.  The various CLASSes
are given in the table below: (NOTE: The "CODE" is a unique, numeric
identifier used by MUR to sort the various CLASSes)

ABBREV	CODE	TYPE				SITES
------	----	------------------------------	-----------------
940	1	XDS 940 mainframe (TYMCOM-IX)	CUP only
PDP	2	DEC PDP-10 mini (TYMCOM-X)	CUP,DAL,FRE and VF
370	3	IBM 370 mainframe (TYMCOM-370)	DAL,FRE and VF
DEC	7	DEC PDP 20/20 mini (TYMCOM-20)	CUP only
FNA	10	FOONLY F3, F4 and 26KL mini	CUP (Bldg "A")
FNC	11	FOONLY F3, F4 and 26KL mini	CUP (Bldg "C")

	At present, these are the only CLASSes that will appear on the
CRASH.SUMMARY output.  Other CLASS codes and abbreviations may be added
at some future date.  Contact the MUR data base administrator for
information on any new CLASS codes.

2: THE SITE ABBREVIATIONS:
	TYMSHARE currently supports 5 valid data centers located around
the country.  The abbreviations, codes and locations of these data
centers are given below: (NOTE: The "CODE" is a unique, numeric
identifier used by MUR to sort locations)

ABBREV	CODE	LOCATION
------	----	----------------------------
CUP	1	Cupertino, California (Bldg "A" and Bldg "C")
DAL	5	Dallas, Texas
FRE	8	Fremont, California
VF	2	Valley Forge, Pennsylvania

Other valid sites may be added or deleted from the MUR data base at a
future date.

3:  THE CRASH CODE ABBREVIATIONS:
	Each time a system crashes, the operators resposible for
supporting that system record the time it crashed, a numeric code that
represents the cause of the crash and the time the system came back up.   
The crash codes vary for different CLASSes to reflect different causes
that occur for the various hardware types.  However, some codes are
common to all CLASSes, for example code 50 always means a public utility
power failure caused the system to crash.  The following is a list of
the various abbreviations, the corresponding crash code and a brief
description of each code, including its group classification, for the
eight CLASSes in CRASH.SUMMARY:
