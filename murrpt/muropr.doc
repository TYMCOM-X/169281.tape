                    THE MACHINE USAGE REPORT SYSTEM


       ((INTRODUCTION))

            MUR is a Machine Usage Report system written  in  MAGNUM  on
       the  TYMCOM-X  (PDP-10)  to  provide  management with timely data
       analysis on the following general concerns:

               -AVAILABILITY - the percentage of scheduled
                time during a certain period that host computers
                were operating in a timesharing mode for users.

               -LOST TIME FACTORS - the amount of time due to
                crashes and specific computer failure categories
                which interfere with and reduce availability.

               -SCHEDULED DOWNTIME FACTORS - the amount of
                time spent performing various categories of
                in-house activities where there was no significant
                timesharing usage on the system.

            This information is of vital importance to a wide  range  of
       interrelated  Data  Service  functions.   Maintenance  derives an
       overall analysis of how well the computers are  operating  and  a
       breakdown  of  hardware  problem  areas;   Operations  derives an
       overall analysis of host reliability and a breakdown  of  general
       system   activities  within  a  specific  time  frame;   Resource
       Planning derives an overall analysis of  time  scheduling  and  a
       breakdown  of various levels of availability.  In all cases, this
       information is  used  both  to  measure  how  well  the  computer
       performed  in  the  past and to identify areas where attention is
       needed in the future.  In addition, the data from this program is
       one   of   the  important  inputs  in  determining  whether  past
       performance warrants  incentive  rewards  and  if  so,  how  much
       incentive.

            The program consists of two main operational sections.

            The UPDATER section is used for daily entry of raw data  and
       allows   correction  of  entries  and  certain  software/hardware
       changes.

            The  REPORT  section  allows  a   wide   range   of   report
       specification  including  weekly and monthly analysis of the data
       that has been previously entered.
                                                                  Page 2
introduction


            MUR differs from the earlier programs in  that  it  combines
       both  the  data  entry section and the report generation into one
       system.

            It uses the relational technology  of  MAGNUM.   This  means
       that  all  data  elements  are  separately  available  and can be
       accessed in a variety of sequences and interrelationships.

            The schema is the overall structure which organizes the data
       base.    This  organization  involves  the  association  of  data
       elements into data files called relations.  The  schema  for  the
       MUR  program  involves  nine relational data files which point to
       each other as described in the diagram








































                                                                  Page 3
MUR RELATIONS


                          RELATION DESCRIPTION


            The first relation  is  SITE.   This  relation  involves  an
       internal  id.,  an  abbreviation  of up to three characters and a
       title of up to 15  characters.   In  general,  this  relation  is
       accessed  whenever  the TIME or SYSTEM relations are called.  The
       current sites are as follows:


               CUP     -       CUPERTINO       (CUPA,CUPC AND PA370)
               HOU     -       HOUSTON         (INCLUDES SCO)
               VF      -       VALLEY FORGE    (INCLUDES ECO)

            The SYSTEM relation involves data concerning a hardware id.,
       a  software  system number, an internal id., a start and end date
       for the system, a prime start and stop time, and  an  'applicable
       flag'  which  determines if the system is factored into incentive
       uptime calculations.  Also, in REPORT procedures, a given  system
       will be reported twice if it's applicable flag has changed during
       the report period -- one report  for  when  the  system  was  not
       applicable  and  once  when it was.  This relation also points to
       the site and class relations and is generally  involved  whenever
       the  time  or schedule relations are accessed.  The data elements
       of this relation (as of the date indicated) are given on the next
       page.

            The relation CLASS is accessed when  code,  time  or  system
       relations  are  accessed.   CLASS  involves  the hardware type as
       follows:

               370     -       TYMCOM-370
               940     -       TYMCOM-IX
               PDP     -       TYMCOM-X
               SRI     -       SRI OFFICE-1

            The  relation  SCHEDULE  involves   scheduled   uptime   and
       scheduled downtime.  It points to the system relation, and may be
       of any complexity.

            The next relation is TIME.  It points  to  the  code,  site,
       system  and  class  relations.   Involved  in  this  relation are
       hardware, date, start time, stop time, scheduled  time,  a  prime
       time flag and a field test flag.

            The fifth relation is CODE.  It points to  class  and  group
       and  is  accessed  whenever  the  TIME  relation  is  used.  Data
       elements in this class are an internal id., a numeric  code,  and
       an  adjustment  flag  which  determines  which codes shall not be
       factored into reliability calculations for adjusted  availability
       and  crash  totals.  This relation also involves an abbreviation,
       title, a start date and an end date.

            The code points to the relation GROUP.  Groups are meant  to
       be general areas which could be applied to any hardware now or in
       the forseeable future.  For reports,  only  those  groups  having
       machine  codes  pointing  to  them  will  be used to organize the
       report outputOUP  involves  an  internal  id.,  a  position,
       abbreviation and title.  Listed below are the current groups:

COMMAND DESCRIPTION


       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))


                        ENTERING THE MUR PROGRAM
                        -------- --- --- -------

            The MUR system is accessed on  C33  in  directory  MUR.   To
       start  the program type 'MAGNUM MUR (CR)'.  MAGNUM will be output
       the current  date  and  time  then  prompt  with  ':'.   All  MUR
       procedures  are  started  with  a command string in the form 'RUN
       PROCEDURE (CR)'  where  valid  procedures  are  those  summarized
       above;   for  example, to input daily system data you'd enter the
       procedure by typing  ':'RUN  UPDATER  (CR).   MAGNUM  outputs  an
       indication  that  it  is loading the procedure, types 'EXECUTION'
       and then prompts with '>'.  This prompt always indicates that you
       are within a MUR procedure.


                     RUNNING THE UPDATER PROCEDURE
                      ------- --- ------ ---------

            This set of procedures should be used  by  the  operator  to
       enter machine code and stop time data from the computer log books
       into the data base.  Certain commands will display data that  has
       been  entered  previously.   Other  commands  perform  diagnostic
       functions on the data base and records entered can be changed  if
       need be.

            To clarify potential  confusion  about  what  constitutes  a
       crash,  the  following definitions and policies are offered:  the
       MUR program  sorts  scheduled  downtime  and  lost  time  entries
       according  to  a  full  24  hour  period,  again  for prime time,
       scheduled time and a final sort  for  adjusted  up  time.   If  a
       system  is  voluntarily  taken  down  by  Operations, a scheduled
       downtime code which best reflects the responsible group should be
       entered instead of entering a lost time code.

            If, however, the system goes down involuntarily (by itself),
       a  lost  time  code  should  be  entered  to  reflect  the  crash
       regardless of whether its during scheduled downtime or uptime.

            A 24 HOUR CRASH reflects any lost time code entered which is
       preceeded  by  an uptime code.  Crashes occurring when the system
       is timesharing during scheduled downtime hours will be  reflected
       in  the 24 HOUR CRASH totals but not in the SCHEDULED or ADJUSTED
       crash totals.

            A PRIME TIME CRASH reflects a lost time code  entered  which
       occurs  during  prime  time  and  is  preceeded by an uptime code
       occurring during prime time.

            A SCHEDULED TIME CRASH is a lost  time  code  entered  which
       occurs during scheduled uptime and is preceeded by an uptime code
       occurring during scheduled uptime.
                                                                 Page 12
UPDATER DESCRIPTION


            ADJUSTED CRASHES is equal to SCHEDULED  TIME  CRASHES  minus
       any  lost  time  code entries where the adjustment flag is set to
       'Y';  for example, power failures.  It is the adjusted uptime and
       adjusted crash totals that are used for incentive calculations.


                                  ADD

            The ADD command allows the normal  daily  entry  of  machine
       code data and stop times.

            The first prompt is for 'DATE OF INPUT'.  This date must  be
       in  the  format  MM-DD-YY  and  any  other  date  format  will be
       rejected.  If more than one day's data needs to be entered,  they
       must be updated one at a time but in any chronological order.

            Next, the program asks for system  number  (eg.   38).   For
       situations where a system number exists in the data base for more
       than one system, MUR will  prepare  to  receive  entries  on  the
       appropriate system having the specified system number on the date
       entered above.

            If all data for the system has  already  been  entered,  the
       program  will  output  the  message '24 HOURS ALREADY ENTERED FOR
       THIS DATE FOR THIS SYSTEM'.  If there are excessive time  records
       in  the  data  base,  the message 'MORE THAN 24 HOURS ENTERED FOR
       THIS SYSTEM FOR THIS DAY;  USE THE CHANGE  COMMAND  TO  ELIMINATE
       OVERLAPPING RECORDS' will be output.  Situations where the system
       does not  have  records  covering  a  full  24  hour  period  are
       described later.

                    ENTERING AN ENTIRE DAY'S RECORDS

            If neither of the above messages is output, the program will
       verify  that  the  hardware id and schedule are appropriate.  The
       question 'IS HW.ID L?' (where L is a letter) is  asked.   If  you
       answer  ''Yes'',  then  MUR checks to see if any other systems is
       assigned that hardware.  If so, the program will ask if you  wish
       to continue with the command.  A situation where a ''Yes'' answer
       is appropriate is where a system  had  its  hardware  id  changed
       mid-day  when,  for  example, a system was relocated to different
       hardware to insulate the customer from a hardware problem on  the
       origiial system's hardware.

            If a 'No' answer is typed in because the  id  is  incorrect,
       you  are  asked to enter the correct id.  Here again, the program
       checks if  any  other  systems  were  assigned  that  id  on  the
       specified  date and gives you the option of continuing if so.  If
       you have to type in a hardware id, the  program  asks  'MAKE  NEW
       HARDWARE PERMANENT?'.  A 'No' answer will instruct the program to
       use the id you entered only for the date specified above.

            The schedule for the system is now checked.   Normally,  the
       standard  schedule of uptime will apply for the system and should
       already be in the data base.  However, if there is no schedule in
       the  data  base, the program will output a message to this effect
                                                                 Page 13
UPDATER DESCRIPTION


       and ask if you wish to continue.  A ''Yes'' should  be  typed  if
       you  are  prepared  to  input  the  schedule that applies on that
       system for that date.

            'SPECIAL SCHEDULE?' is the next  question.   If  you  answer
       ''Yes''  the  program  will  prompt  'INPUT SCHED.UP, SCHED.DOWN'
       allowing you to enter it.  Time entries should  be  in  the  form
       'HHMM,HHMM'.   The  prompt will repeat if there are more schedule
       entries for that 24 hour period.

            MUR checks for various time range  errors  and  ignores  any
       entry  that  would  conflict  with  a  previous  time entry;  for
       example, if a split schedule were entered as follows:
               'INPUT SCHED.UP,SCHED.DOWN' 0000,0300
               'INPUT SCHED.UP,SCHED.DOWN' 0200,2400
       Since the  last  sched.up  entry  (0200)  was  before  the  prior
       sched.down  entry  (0300),  a  conflict  would  exist.   In  this
       example, MUR would ignore the last pair of times.

            Once the entire 24  hour  schedule  has  been  entered,  the
       program  will ask 'IS THE SPECIAL SCHEDULE CORRECT?' An answer of
       'No' will purge all special schedule entries  and  allow  you  to
       start  over.   Double  check  all  entries,  since  an inaccurate
       schedule will distort all subsequent data input.  If the schedule
       is  correct,  you  will be asked if you want to make the schedule
       permanent.  If so, the  special  schedule  you  just  input  will
       become  the  standard  schedule for the system once you've closed
       the relation by quitting the program.



                                     NOTE

           If there was no previous schedule in  the  data  base,  a
           schedule  can  be input using this procedure;  Answer 'Y'
           to  the  the  question  'SPECIAL  SCHEDULE',  enter   the
           schedule  and  then , if appropriate, make it a permanent
           schedule.


            At this point the MUR ADD command will  prompt  for  machine
       code,  stop  time  data by outputting an asterisk ('*').  A start
       time of 0000 is assumed.  The  program  will  accept  valid  code
       entries (described in the the INTRO section of this document) and
       reject any invalid codes  or  time  conflicts.   The  prompt  for
       code,stop  time  pair  will  repeat  until a stop time of 2400 is
       encountered.

            A new capability is available with regard  to  machine  code
       entries:   if  a 100 is added to the code, MUR will interpret the
       code to apply on a system under field test.  A 200 added  to  the
       code  indicates the system was moved to a different hardware.  If
       a 300 is added to the code, then  both  above  conditions  apply;
       for  example, if you enter code 310, the data is accepted to mean
       the specified system was timesharing (code 10), is on a different
       hardware  from  the  id  indicated earlier and is running a field
                                                                 Page 14
UPDATER DESCRIPTION


       test (add 300 to code).  When either 200 or 300 is added  to  the
       machine  code,  the program will ask for the new hardware id , if
       any, and issue a warning if the id entered is assigned to another
       system.   Next,  the program will ask if you wish to continue and
       if you wish to make the new hardware id permanent for the current
       system.

            When all codes for the specified day have been entered,  the
       program returns to the '>' prompt, and awaits any further updater
       commands.
                                                                 Page 15
UPDATER DESCRIPTION


           ADDING RECORDS FOR A DATE WITH INCOMPLETE RECORDS

            The ADD command will allow completing code,stop  time  input
       for  days  with  incomplete  entries  for  the  24  hour  period.
       Whenever you specify a date of input and incomplete records exist
       already  for  that  date,  MUR  will be output any code,stop time
       records it already has up to the first time gap  for  that  date.
       These  records  already  in  the  data base will be surrounded by
       square brackets (eg.  '[10,1500]').  At that  point  the  program
       will  prompt  with  '*',  so  you  can  fill  the time gap with a
       code,stop time pair.


                                     NOTE

           The exception to this is a situation where the  time  gap
           exists for the beginning of the day (0000).  In this case
           you will see  only  the  '*'  prompt.   Already  existing
           records will be output after you have filled the gap with
           a code,stop time for the beginning of the day.


            As records are input to complete the  24  hour  period,  the
       next  record  already  in  the data base will be output up to the
       next gap , if any,, and the program will prompt with '*' for  the
       next  entry  to be input.  Entering a later stop time at any pont
       in this command will change the data base entry  to  fill  in  as
       much  of  the  gap  as  possible.  This cycle of listing existing
       entries up to a gap and letting you enter new data to fill in the
       gap will continue until the day's entries are complete.

            When MUR accepts the data, it may automatically  consolidate
       entries  that  use the same code and are chronologically adjacent
       to each other;  for example, the message 'STOP  TIME  CHANGED  TO
       1500'  would  indicate  that  your  entry  of  (code) 10,1300 was
       consolidated with the entry it already had of 10,1500.

            If a stop time of 2400 is entered, the program will fill all
       existing  time gaps for the date specified with the code entered.
       In this case, no further existing entries will  type  out.   When
       all  records  for  the  day  are complete, the program returns to
       command mode and the prompter '>'.


                              CHG (OBJECT)

            The CHG command allows the user to change specific  relation
       records  for  a specified system, date and time range.  An object
       must follow the change command.  This object indicates what it is
       you  wish  to  change  (that  is,  COD  - code record, SIT - site
       record, SF - field test flag, HW - hardware id, PF -  prime  time
       flag, ST - schedule flag or ST - a stop time flag).

            After you type the desired command, the program prompts  for
       the 'DATE YOU WISH TO CHANGE' and 'SYSTEM NUMBER'.  It checks the
       input you supply to verify that the system number is valid and at
                                                                 Page 16
UPDATER DESCRIPTION


       least  one time record already exists for the specified date.  If
       any gaps or overlaps exist, they will be reported at this time.

            When MUR has determined that these inputs are  relevant  for
       the  change  command, it asks for 'START,STOP TIME'.  This should
       be entered in the form 'HHMM,HHMM, and should  reflect  the  time
       frame  for  which you want a record changed.  This entry will not
       invalidate any previous entry, and it does not have to correspond
       to  previous  records  since  the program will automatically make
       whatever adjustments are necessary.  For  the  'CHG  ST'  command
       only,  the start time specified must exist in a record.  The only
       general requirements are that the stop time must be greater  than
       the  stop time, and neither the start time nor the stop time must
       be greater than 2400.

            What the next prompt will  be  depends  on  the  object  you
       entered when you issued the CHG (OBJECT) command.  If you entered
       the CHG ST command, then the stop time  you  entered  above  will
       replace the previous stop time entry, but the previous start time
       entry will remain the same.


                                     NOTE

           CHG ST can only be used to make the stop time  less  than
           what  was  previously  entered.  Otherwise, time overlaps
           would be created.  To replace the previous stop time with
           a  later  one,  the  ADD  command  must  be used (see the
           description above on 'Adding Records  For  An  Incomplete
           Date).   For all other forms of the CHG command, both the
           start and stop times can be altered.


            If the command entered was to change the code  or  site  for
       the  time  entered,  the  program will ask for 'NEW CODE' or 'NEW
       SITE'.  These entries must be valid within the MUR  schema.   For
       changing the hardware id, the id you enter will be switched as of
       the time frame involved in the start,stop time range.

            For commands to change a flag (field test, sched.  or  prime
       time), the only two valid answers are ''Yes'' or 'No'.  A ''Yes''
       answer is interpreted to mean that the specified flag  should  be
       turned  on.   If that flag is already on, the 'Yes' answer has no
       effect on the data.  The 'No' answer turns off  the  flag  if  it
       isn't already off.

            At this point, the program will ask  if  you  have  'ANOTHER
       CHANGE  FOR  THIS  START,STOP  TIME'.  If you do type ''Yes'' and
       then enter the CHG (OBJECT) command that is needed for  the  next
       change.

            Once there are no further changes for the time frame of  the
       start,stop  time you entered above, the program will ask if there
       are any other changes for the date specified.  A  ''Yes''  answer
       will  cause  the  program  to  branch  back  to  the  prompt  for
       'START,STOP TIME'.  You can continue in this fashion until  there
                                                                 Page 17
UPDATER DESCRIPTION


       are  no further changes necessary for the system and date you are
       changing.

            When the CHG procedure has been completed, the program  will
       indicate  if  any  gaps  or  overlaps  still  exist.   If  so, no
       consolidation or combination of entries will take place  for  the
       records involved in the change.


                                 DELETE

            This command is used to delete all records for  a  specified
       system  and  date.   The  program will ask first for the 'DATE TO
       DELETE' and then for 'SYSTEM NUMBER'.  This command does not take
       effect  on  the  data  base  unless  the  program is able to quit
       properly (as indicated by a return to the MUR prompt '>') thereby
       closing the relations involved.


                             DELETE RECORD

            This MUR  UPDATER  command  is  primarily  used  to  correct
       overlapping  time  records, and it assumes you have used the LIST
       SW command (described  below)  to  determine  what  time  records
       already  exist in the data base.  DELETE RECORD asks for 'DATE TO
       DELETE' and 'SYSTEM NUMBER', but once valid entries are typed in,
       the  program  will  prompt 'START TIME:'.  Entering a time in the
       form 'HHMM' will instruct MUR to delete the time record beginning
       at  that  start  time  up to the next start time for the date you
       specified.

            The message 'ALL RECORDS FOR THAT SYSTEM FOR THAT  DATE  ARE
       DELETED'  is  an  indication  that MUR was unable to execute this
       command because all records had already been deleted.   'NO  SUCH
       RECORD'  means  that  there was no time record for the start date
       you entered.  If the data was never entered in the  first  place,
       the  message  'NO  RECORDS FOR THAT SYSTEM FOR THAT DATE' will be
       output.


                                LIST HW

            An entire day's records for a specified hardware id will  be
       output by using this command.  You must supply the 'DATE TO LIST'
       and the 'HARDWARE ID'.  The program will ask that you specify the
       class  you  wish  the  id to refer to.  If more than one software
       system used the specified hardware on the date you entered,  data
       from  both systems will be output together.  If there are no time
       records in the data base, only the list headings will be output.


                                LIST SW

            This is much like LIST HW except that it focuses on software
       system  number.   You  must  supply  a valid system number or the
       program will merely return back to MUR command level.
                                                                 Page 18
UPDATER DESCRIPTION


                                CHECK SW

            Before  any  CHECK  command  will  execute  in  the  UPDATER
       program,  you  must first quit and then reissue the 'RUN UPDATER'
       command.  This enables MAGNUM to move any records that have  just
       been entered into a permanent storage file.  The CHECK SW command
       first asks for 'START,end  DATES'  to  be  entered  in  the  form
       MM-DD-YY,mm-dd-yy.  This entry provides the range of time records
       that will be checked for gaps and/or overlapping records.

            Next,, you will be  asked  to  enter  the  'SYSTEM  NUMBER'.
       Normally, the correct response is a valid software system number,
       but it is also possible to enter a zero (0) here.  If a  zero  is
       input  in reponse to the prompt, the program assumes that a check
       of the data for multiple systems is desired.  To enable this, you
       would  then  answer  the prompts 'SITE' and 'CLASS'.  The answers
       may either be a valid site and class  abbreviation  or  the  word
       'ALL'.

            Depending on your input, the program  will  check  for  time
       record  problems  for  a  specified  system,  an  entire class of
       systems for a site, all systems for a site, or all systems in all
       sites.

            The amount of time this takes to execute will vary depending
       on  the amount of data you wish checked.  If any time record gaps
       are encountered in the data they will be  reported.   A  gap  can
       usually  be corrected using the ADD command.  A time record which
       overlaps (ie.  first time record is greater than the second time)
       can  usually  be corrected using the CHG command (although it may
       also be necessary to use DELETE RECORD).  If  there  is  no  time
       entered  for  a certain date, the whole day will be reported as a
       gap.  If  several  days'  data  is  missing,  this  command  will
       indicate the date range where gaps exist in the data base.


                                CHECK HW

            This command performs much the same checking of time records
       as  CHECK  SW  described  above,  but  it  runs slower due to the
       software system number oriented  organization  of  the  time-data
       relations.   The first paragraph of the CHECK SW description also
       applies to this command.

            CHECK HW prompts for  'HARDWARE.ID',  then  'CLASS'.   If  a
       carriage  return only is entered for the hardware id, the program
       will also prompt for 'SITE'.  Responses must be  valid  site  and
       class  abbreviations.   If  you enter the word 'ALL' there may be
       conflicts resulting, but any output should be listed  separately.
       Once  SITE  and CLASS have been input, the program will check all
       hardware id's in the system relation pertaining to the  specified
       site  and  class.   Output  of  any  gaps or overlaps in the time
       records checked will begin with the heading '(HW.ID), (CLASS)  AS
       OF (DATE)'.  
                                     NOTE

           You can use the date from this heading as  input  to  the
           LIST  HW  command  (described  above) to get the software
           system number having the time record error.


            Overlaps reported by this  command  may  be  the  result  of
       multiple  software  systems  having  been  entered  on  the  same
       hardware for the same date and time.

            Upon completion, the CHECK HW command returns to MUR command
       level.
                                                                 Page 20
REPORT DESCRIPTION


                       RUNNING REPORT PROCEDURES
                       ------- ------ ----------

            MUR data can be selected and sorted in a variety of ways for
       reports.   Each way involves a separate procedure which is called
       from MAGNUM command level in the form 'RUN (REPORT.NAME)'.  For a
       description  of what each report entails, you are referred to the
       COMMAND SUMMARY section of this document.

            In general, all reports are designed to require only one TTY
       page  for  output.   The output file specified in any report must
       conform to standard TYMCOM-X naming conventions.   This  involves
       up  to six characters of filename followed by an optional maximum
       of three characters of extension.  In addition,  MAGNUM  requires
       that  the first character of the filename must be an alphabetical
       character.   The  desired  output  file  will  be  written   into
       directory  (MURRPT).   The  program  will  output  an appropriate
       message to verify the name  of  the  file  containing  the  given
       report.   You  cannot specify another directory for report output
       in MUR, but later, the files in (MURRPT) may be renamed or copied
       using XEXEC commands if that is desired.


                                     NOTE

           MAGNUM has an  additional  noteworthy  feature  regarding
           filename input.  If you type '-ANY' or '-A' following the
           last character of the filename input, MAGNUM  will  write
           the  report  to  the  filenamed  regardless of whether it
           would overwrite an existing file  or  write  onto  a  new
           file.  Use the addition of the string '-NEW' or '-N', and
           the program will be output only if the resulting filename
           would  be  a  new  file.   '-EXIST' or '-E' following the
           filename or extension will be output  only  if  the  name
           used already exists.  If none of these additional options
           are input, the program will report whether  the  filename
           is   new   or   already   existing,  and  wait  for  your
           confirmation before writing the file.


            It is also possible to output the report to the terminal  by
       answering the prompt for 'OUTPUT FILE' with 'TER'.  In this case,
       the program will instruct you to position the paper at the top of
       the page and then type return (car ret).  If this is desired, you
       should set the terminal characteristic 'TTY WIDTH 80' in EXEC  to
       avoid right margin wrap-around problems.

            For all report procedures,  only  entries  within  scheduled
       uptime(and  excluding  any  adjusted  codes)  are  considered for
       calculations pertaining to incentive related figures.  Therefore,
       any crashes during scheduled downtime will not be counted against
       uptime results.  No report will be  output  for  any  time  frame
       unless MUR records are available for that time frame.
                                                                 Page 21
REPORT DESCRIPTION


                             CRASH.SUMMARY

            This report command allows the user to generate  an  updated
       tally  for  all  systems  valid for the time frame of the desired
       report in the data base.  If desired, it can be run  on  a  daily
       basis.   The program prompts 'THIS MONTH (T), LAST MONTH (L) OR A
       DATE RANGE (R)'.  Entering a T will cause the program to generate
       a  report  of  crashes  entered from the beginning of the current
       month up to today's date.  The L response will organize  a  crash
       report  covering  the entire previous month.  If you input R, the
       prompt 'START, END DATES' will be output to allow you to type  in
       the date range for which a crash summary is desired.  You will be
       asked to type in a site and class specification and an  input  of
       'ALL' may be used for either or both.

            At this point, the program will prompt  for  'OUTPUT  FILE',
       and  once  it  is  entered, will begin to generate the report.  A
       heading at the top of the report will  indicate  the  time  frame
       covered.


                                 WEEKLY

            The weekly procedure first prompts  for  'DATE  OF  REPORT'.
       This  should  reflect  the  first date for which data is desired.
       The first date need not be a Monday.   Next,  the  query  'WEEKS'
       asks  that you input the number of weeks you wish included in the
       report.

            Once this has been input, the  prompt  for  'SYSTEM  NUMBER'
       will  type  out.   Valid  replies  are either a specific software
       system number, or zero (0) if you wish the report  to  deal  with
       multiple systems.  If zero is input, you will be asked to type in
       a valid site and class abbreviation.  The word 'ALL' may also  be
       used if you wish a report for all sites and/or all classes.

            The final input to this procedure is for 'OUTPUT  FILE'.   A
       discussion of valid responses to this prompt can be found in this
       document in the paragraphs above CRASH SUMMARY.


                               HW.WEEKLY

            This procedure prompts for 'DATE  OF  REPORT',  'WEEKS'  and
       'HARDWARE  ID',  as  well as 'SITE' and 'CLASS'.  The hardware id
       must be valid within the MUR data base.  The input for  site  and
       class  are  also  crucial;  for example, a specified hardware has
       moved from one site to another---if a specific site  abbreviation
       is  entered,  the  hardware in question will be reported only for
       the period before or after it's site location was changed in  the
       data  base.   On  the other hand, if the answer 'ALL' is used for
       SITE, the hardware in this  example  will  be  reported  for  the
       entire  time  frame  specified despite the fact that it had moved
       from one site to another.
                                                                 Page 22
REPORT DESCRIPTION


            If 'ALL' is used for class, output for more than  one  class
       of  computer may be output on the same report.  In this case, the
       output would be separated by  class  for  each  system,  if  any,
       having the same specified hardware id.



                              SITE.WEEKLY

            This report organizes the data by site, and  within-site  by
       class.   Prompts  from the program are 'DATE OF REPORT', 'WEEKS',
       'SITE', 'CLASS' and 'OUTPUT FILE'.  Either valid abbreviations or
       the word 'ALL' can be used for the site and class prompts.


                              CLASS.WEEKLY

            Most of the prompts for this procedure are identical to  the
       SITE  WEEKLY  description.  There is, however, no prompt for SITE
       since the report generated will display an entire class  (or  all
       classes) regardless of site.
                                                                 Page 23
REPORT DESCRIPTION


                                MONTHLY

            This  report  focuses  on  a  specified  six  month   period
       consisting  of  monthly totals.  The first prompt will be 'ENDING
       DATE OF REPORT AS MMM YY'.  An example of a valid MMM YY  is  JUL
       77 --- that is, how many six month time frames should be included
       in the report.

            The  next  query,  'SYSTEM  NUMBER',  will  accept  a  valid
       software  system  number or zero (0).  Entering zero here assumes
       you wish a monthly report dealing with multiple systems.  So that
       you  can indicate which systems you are referring to, the program
       prompts for 'SITE' and 'CLASS'.  Correct responses for these  two
       queries  can  be  either  existing  abbreviations (eg.  'CUP' and
       '370'), or the word 'ALL'.  The ALL response indicates  that  you
       want  all  sites and/or classes reported together.  'OUTPUT FILE'
       is the last prompt to be answered before processing begins.

            MUR now searches the data base  for  relevant  entries  with
       which  to  generate  the report.  If any systems lack records for
       the time frame you indicated, the program skips the systems.

            Machine  code  totals  are  organized  into  group   totals.
       Following  individual  code  totals  and  group totals, scheduled
       timesharing and availability figures are output.  After this, the
       output reports a summary of scheduled-time crashes for the period
       and monthly crash totals.


                               HW.MONTHLY

            Reports created  by  this  procedure  resemble  the  MONTHLY
       output  except  that  there  is only a single hardware system per
       report.  Prompts are also similar,  but  you  will  be  asked  to
       supply site and class for the hardware id you enter.

            Answer the prompt 'SITE' with 'ALL' if the computer hardware
       specified was moved from one site to another during the six month
       periods you wish covered by this report.

            If you answer 'ALL' to  the  'CLASS'  prompt,  records  from
       different  computers  with  the same hardware id, if any, will be
       reported separately.


                              SITE.MONTHLY

            All applicable systems' data for a particular or  all  sites
       are  merged  and  reported  by  this procedure.  Queries include:
       'ENDING DATE OF REPORT AS MMM YY', 'PERIODS', 'SITE' and 'CLASS'.
       The  answer  'ALL'  can  be used for site and/or class.  You will
       also be  prompted  for  'OUTPUT  FILE',  and  should  input  file
       specifications as described above.


                             CLASS.MONTHLY
                                                                 Page 24
REPORT DESCRIPTION


            CLASS.MONTHLY resembles the  SITE.MONTHLY  reports  in  most
       respects.   A  notable  difference is the absence of a prompt for
       SITE, since data within the specified six month periods  will  be
       reported by class without regard to site.
                                                                 Page 25

ERRORS AND RECOVERIES


       ((ERRORS AND RECOVERIES))


            The default TYMCOM-X EXEC  is  XEXEC.   This  allows  the  following
       special  characters  to  correct  mistyped  entries  providing  the final
       carriage return has not yet been entered

               CHARACTER               FUNCTION
               ---------               --------
               CONTROL A               DELETE LAST CHAR. TYPED. XEXEC 
                                       SURROUNDS THE CHARACTER(S) DELETED
                                       WITH BACK SLASHES ().

               CONTROL Q               DELETE THE LAST ENTIRE LINE TYPED.
                                       XEXEC PRINTS AN UP ARROW ().

            Within MUR, prompters seeking a 'Y' or 'N' ('Yes' or No) answer will
       reject any other entry.  The program will, however, give the user another
       chance to enter either 'Y' or 'N'.

            The error message in the form 'ILLEGAL OBJECT' usually indicates the
       program  was  given a null entry (eg.  merely a carriage return) and that
       more data is required.  In this case, start the command in question  over
       again.

            MAGNUM itself will be output error messages  in  the  form  '?   NN'
       where  NN is an error number.  Whenever errors occur during command input
       following a prompt, MAGNUM will issue the prompt  again.   If  the  error
       message  occurs  during  command  execution, the user will be returned to
       command level and must reenter the entire command.

            If an ALTMODE or ESCAPE is used during a procedure or  command,  the
       message '*ESCAPE* - DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE?' will type out.  If you wish
       to continue, type 'Y' and the procedure or  command  will  continue  from
       exactly  where  it  was halted by the escape character.  Typing 'N' halts
       the program, and all entries prior to the escape are  lost.   It  is  not
       possible  to  escape to EXEC and later reenter or continue the processing
       that was interrupted.  In this case, all data must be entered over again.

            A message in the form 'NO SUCH (OBJECT)'  indicates  that  a  string
       entered was valid but was not found after a search of the data base.

            If you ever see a message in the form '*PROGRAM  ERROR*',  save  the
       terminal hardcopy and communicate all relevant details to Roy Roskilly.

            The 'INVALID FILLER' message refers to the  character  between  data
       elements  (eg.  the dash used in the string 08-02).  usually, you will be
       allowed to reenter the data with a valid filler.

            Should you ever see the MAGNUM message 'NEW SCHEMA - OK?',  you  are
       not connected to the proper directory and files.  Type NO, then QUIT, and
       log into or GFD to dir MUR on C33.

            If you are in doubt about the input  expected  from  a  MUR  prompt,
       typing  the word 'HELP' may obtain certain primitive hints about the kind
       of valid input being sought.
                                                                         Page 42
ERRORS AND RECOVERIES


            Most of the data problems in MUR will be detected and reported using
       CHECK  HW and CHECK SW in the UPDATER procedure.  You are referred to the
       description of these commands in this document.

            Occasionally, time schedule overlaps are  the  result  of  duplicate
       hardware  id's  in the data base;  that is, two systems in the same class
       using the same hardware id--- the schedule of one system may  merge  with
       and  overlap  the schedule of the other system.  An example of this is if
       system 33 has an id of UU and a schedule of 0000 (start time), 0300 (stop
       time), and system 38, id UU, has a schedule of 0200 (start), 2300 (stop).
       Since 33's stop time (0300) is later than 38's  start  time  (0200),  and
       both  systems  use  the  same  hardware  id,  an  overlap  exists.   This
       possibility is identified by using the 'CHECK HW' command in UPDATER.

            Files  used  for  REPORT  output  must  conform  to   XEXEC   naming
       conventions.   This  means  that  there  can  be  up to six characters of
       alphanumeric filename followed by an optional period (.) and up to  three
       characters  of extension.  For additional information on naming files and
       other related XEXEC conventions you are referred to the  Tymshare  manual
       'XEXEC' dated Dec.  1974 (pubs   321).

            Certain report discrepancies between mur and any  previous  programs
       may  occur due to the fact that the older programs automatically reported
       certain codes as scheduled downtime entries.   MUR  on  the  other  hand,
       considers  what  schedule condition existed during the time period of the
       code.  To avoid this discrepancy, you should  make  use  of  the  special
       schedule  option  in  updater  to reflect that a particular entry did not
       occur during what would otherwise be scheduled uptime.

            Reports do no checking of data  validity.   Thus,  for  example,  if
       erroneous  data  was  entered  in UPDATER, it is possible for a report to
       contain a 25 hour day.  Use the CHECK commands in UPDATER to isolate data
       causing problems of this nature.  Use the ADD and CHG commands to correct
       the problems indicated.  If a change is attempted for a time period which
       would  wholly  or partially coincide with a time gap, the change will not
       be allowed.  For this case, the ADD command should be used instead.
