         SECTION 1.0 Introduction
         _______ _ _ ____________


         The following  procedure is  designed to  provide TI  Pro-Lite users
         with the steps necessary to download  NIB and BND files to diskettes
         and transfer  these files  to the TYMNET  Engine.  These  steps will
         function on any  NIB file including diagnostic files,  slot files or
         node bound  files.  Two  primary pieces  of software  are needed  to
         accomplish the transfer process:  NAD  (on the TYMCOM-X) and TERMITE
         (on the TI Pro-Lite).  The following equipment is necessary in order
         to perform the load/transfer process:

          o  TYMNET Engine, MINI-Engine or MICRO-Engine (with console).

          o  TI Pro-Lite PC (with diskette containing the TERMITE Program).

          o  Straight-through cable #ASC140-02PP (to  connect TI Pro-Lite to
             Engine for TTYLOAD through multifunction port).

	 TI Pro-Lite File Transfer Procedures


         SECTION 2.0 TYMCOM-X NAD Files to TI Pro-Lite
         _______ _ _ ________ ___ _____ __ __ ________


         The transferring  of NAD files  from a  TYMCOM-X to the  TI Pro-Lite
         involves four main steps:

           o  Logging into the the TYMCOM-X where  the file to be transferred
              resides.

              This step is accomplished  by booting the TI  Pro-Lite with the
              Network diskette containing  the TERMITE program.  If  the ver-
              sion of TERMITE is less than  version 2.01 is is important that
              the SLOT  A ON command  in MS-DOS  be issued before  TERMITE is
              invoked.   TERMITE version  2.01 will  automatically issue  the
              SLOT A ON command.  It is also important to note that when log-
              ging  in  the  following control  character  sequence  MUST  be
              entered:

                    CNTL-X, CNTL-R and CNTL-<gouging level>

                    where
                       <gouging level> = D for 4800 baud
                       <gouging level> = C for 2400 baud
                       <gouging level> = B for all  other baud rates

              The CNTL-X requests  that TYMNET control  the flow  of terminal
              output with X-ON  and X-OFF to prevents data  loss.  The CNTL-R
              allows terminal  control of  received data  flow with  X-ON and
              X-OFF.  The CNTL-<gouging level> determines the number of char-
              acters that can be transmitted over the circuit every half sec-
              ond.

           o  Initializing the TYMCOM-X to TI Pro-Lite transfer software.

              The TI Pro-Lite software  is initialized by typing  an ALT-X to
              get to the TERMITE command prompt  "Enter Command:" on the bot-
              tom line and setting the TI  Pro-Lite in receive mode by typing
              "BRECEIVE <pc  filename>" followed  by a  carriage return.   At
              this point is  is necessary to insure that  the terminal itself
              doen not  become involved  in any  character backpressuring  by
              typing the command "TERMINAL  DUMB".  Return to the  XEXEC com-
              mand level by typing a carriage return.

              The TYMCOM-X software is initiated by entering NAD by typing "R
              NAD" followed by a carriage return.   The NAD file is then read
              into NAD's local memory to determine the last address contained
              in the  file.  This is  accomplished by entering  the following
              NAD commands: "%F <filename>" and  ";G".  The "%F" command will
              open the file for read-only, while  the ";G" will get the local
              image and print to the terminal the data ranges read.

	 TI Pro-Lite File Transfer Procedures


           o  Transferring the file from the TYMCOM-X to the TI Pro-Lite:

              This step involves starting the NAD  sending process and start-
              ing the TI  Pro-Lite receive process.  The  NAD sending process
              is done by the command "0, <last  data range read + 1>;8".  The
              TI Pro-Lite receive process is commenced  by typing an ALT-F as
              soon as NAD echoes a carriage  return following the ";8".  Note
              that the NAD command does NOT  end with a carriage return.  The
              ALT-F must  be done after NAD  echoes the carriage  return, and
              before the file begins printing on the terminal.  The ";8" com-
              mand signals  NAD to transfer the  core image (range from  0 to
              the last byte + 1 ) to the terminal (and the TI Pro-Lite simul-
              taneously via TERMITE)  at the current login  baud rate.  After
              issuing  these two commands, the NAD  file will be sent to both
              the TI  Pro-Lite and the users  terminal, which will  result in
              some strange  output to the terminal,  this is expected  and is
              not a problem.  NAD will print  "Loaded" when the file transfer
              is complete.

           o  Terminating the TYMCOM-X to TI Pro-Lite transfer software.
 
              The TI Pro-Lite software is terminated  by typing ALT-F,  while
              the TYMCOM-X  software is terminated by  typing a "%Q"  to exit
              NAD.

	 TI Pro-Lite File Transfer Procedures



         SECTION 3.0 TI Pro-Lite to TYMNET Engine Transfer
         _______ _ _ __ ________ __ ______ ______ ________


         The transferring  of files  between the TI  Pro-Lite and  the TYMNET
         Engine involves connecting the TI Pro-Lite directly to the  TTY port
         (on the Multifunction board on Full/Mini  Engines) or the Multifunc-
         tion port on the Micro Engine.  When loading a Micro Engine, a front
         console is also necessary  for execution of the NAD file  once it is
         loaded.  The transfer rate from the  TI Pro-Lite is solely dependent
         upon the speed selected on the  Multifunction Board or Micro Engine.
         The transfer process involves the following steps:

           o  Connecting the TI Pro-Lite to the TTY or Multifunction port

           o  Invoking the TERMITE program by typing the following:

                TERMITE DUMB 1 <speed> CYAN

           o  Initializing   the   transfer  process   by   typing   "TTYLOAD
              <pc-filename>" followed by  a carriage return.  This  step will
              direct the user to place the machine in boot and enter the fol-
              lowing on the console:

                DTA 60 ADR RUN

              which will allow  the machine to  receive the file  being sent.
              Following this  a carriage return  is typed  on the PC  and the
              file transfer begins, with the  display on the Engine's console
              cycling through the  addresses received.  When the  transfer is
              complete, the   leftmost 5 digits  on the Engines  console will
              display "F FFFF"  is the transfer was  successful.  If anything
              other  than   "F FFFF"  is  displayed,  the  transfer  must  be
              attempted again.

           o  At this point the object  file just sent is ready  to be execu-
              ted.  The following instructions are entered via the console:

                DTA SET <start> ADR RUN

                where
                  <start> = 0200 is file loaded was a diagnostic file
                  <start> = 0070 if file loaded was a bound file
 
           o  At this point the Engine will begin executing the code.  If the
              code was a diagnostic program the  TI Pro-Lite will now display
              the diagnostic banner and prompt  indicating the TI Pro-Lite is
              now acting  as a  terminal connected  to the  TTY/Multifunction
              port.  If the  file was a bound  file, the node will  begin the
              process of bringup and entrance into the network.

         SECTION 4.0 TI Pro to TI Pro-Lite Transfer
         _______ _ _ __ ___ __ __ ________ ________


	 The transferring of  files between the TI  Professional Computer and
         the TI Pro-Lite  PC is done through  the TERMITE program and  can be
         run at speeds up to 19.2K.  The transfer requires a cross-over cable
         (#ASC140-20) connecting  the comm port  on the  TI Pro and  the comm
         port (slot a/b) on the Pro-Lite PC:

 
              +-------------+                      +--------------+
              +   TI  Pro   +   ===============>   +  TI Pro-Lite +
              +  Comm Port  +       ASC140-20      +   Slot  A/B  +
              +-------------+                      +--------------+

 
         The first step  in the transfer process  is to create a  direct link
         between the comm cards  on both TI computers.  This is  done by con-
         necting the  cross-over cable and  executing the TERMITE  program on
         each PC with the following specifications:

             TERMITE DUMB 1 19200 CYAN

 	 Once this connection  has been made, any characters typed  on one PC
         will echo on the other PC (if the character echoes on the PC that it
         is typed on, the connection has not been made and must be re-tried).
         The following sequence of commands on the sending and receiving PC's
         is then performed:

           o  On the sending PC, type an ALT-X to  return to the TERMITE com-
              mand prompt and enter "BSEND <pc-filename>"  followed by a car-
              riage return.  This will place TERMITE in the send mode.   Type
	      another carriage  return to  return to  the direct link between
	      the PC comm boards.

	   o  On the receiving  PC, type  an ALT-X to  return to  the TERMITE
              command prompt and enter "BRECEIVE <pc-filename>" followed by a
              carriage return.  This will place  TERMITE in the receive mode.
              Type  another carriage  return  to return  to  the direct  link
              between the PC comm cards, and type ALT-F to begin receiving.

	   o  On the sending  PC, type  an ALT-S  to begin  sending the  file
              across the  direct link.  The file  will echo on  the receiving
              PC, and  following completion of  the transfer, the  sending PC
              will display "Transfer complete" on the bottom line.

           o  After the  file is  transferred, on  the receiving  PC type  an
              ALT-F to stop receiving data.

	   o  On the sending PC, type an ALT-S to terminate the sending proc-
              ess.

           o  On the receiving  PC, type  an ALT-X to  return to  the TERMITE
              command prompt  and type "CLOSE"  followed by two  (2) carriage
              returns.   This will  insure  that the  file  just received  is
              closed and ready for use.  Type an ALT-Q to return to MS-DOS.
